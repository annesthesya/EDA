negative,2.0,"There is apparently no such thing as a size 12 1/2 Ahnu Coburn low for men, even though Amazon lists it (""just two left in this size"" etc.).  Three times I ordered the 12 1/2 and three times I received size 13.  I was assured by Amazon on-line Customer service after the second time that in fact the size 12 1/2 existed and that I should order again in a couple weeks, which I did and once again got a 13!  I just checked the Ahnu site and they do not list a 12 1/2 so I am guessing it does not exits.  The shoes look good but are looser than I hoped, even with thick socks. I guess I have problem feet I guess (12 is too small) but if the size does not exist, Amazon should not continue to say that it does and then send (or Harrison shoes sends) the wrong size.",Available sizes misleading or wrong -- apparently no 12 1/2!!

negative,2.0,"My size is usually Large or XL.  I went with XL based on the listing.  It barely fit and then only as a sort of low-rise.  The product is basically--and feels like--an athletic supporter.  There is no elastic around the legs so the material slides toward the center.

negative,2.0,"I have had my nose pierced for 14 years (ouch, that really just made me feel old) and have always preferred a nose bone or nose screw for the minimal look and ease of care. I work in a conservative office and though there is no policy against facial jewelry, I've always stayed on the conservative end. When I saw these with the bone on the end I was excited to try them out, even if just for the weekend for something a little fun. I've never gauged my nose so it has remained at the default 18g. So I ordered the 3/8"" size. Upon receiving I was very disappointed with the size of the bone (end). It is easily twice the size of my piercing hole. I attempted to lube up the hole and push it through but it was impossible. I also noticed while examining the piece that the actual hoop seemed to be very small. Curiously, I pushed it through backwards to confirm and it just barely cleared the edge of my nostril. I really don't think I have a large nose so I was surprised at how small it seemed. The actual jewelry seems very nice quality and would hold up well, I just wish there were a smaller gauge so I could truly try it out!

I would have returned these had I not been so sure they would stretch.,Two stars
negative,2.0,These boots are not particularly warm nor are they good on slippery snow.  They are too open and loose at the top so snow enters.

But it rubs enough to give me a blister, without socks, in a very short time. I don't think they'll breathe, either, because they are coated with a rubber substance. I will continue wearing them, but just not without socks.

A few years ago I bought their contemporary styles and saw that they were made in Portugal and fit differently (noy as well) but I was ok with it. Well, for my birthday this year I got the Dansko Scout Brush off ankle boot. When I opened the box I noticed right away that it looked different. The boots were shaped more like the box than the Danskos I was used to. Then I put them on and it did not seem like they were actually crafted to fit the human foot. The craftmanship and quality have been sacrificed when Dansko started making their shoes in China. This will be the last pair of Danskos I buy that is made anywhere but Denmark.

This bra (Playtex # 4913) I will be returning for an exchange to a different style because the quality of it is VERY poor, with lots of cheap plastic parts (strap loops and band hooks). It's unevenly sewn together and the seams are off, so there's no way it'll last for repeated washings and wear. But that's NOT a seller problem, that's a Playtex problem! It also fit weird, kind of baggy along the bottom of the cups next to the underwire, like I was wearing a sock instead of a bra. But that's likely a function of the cup style, which is two thin layers of fabric rather than thick molded cups, which I'm used to. As a size DD cup, fit and lift is critical to a comfortable and attractive fit. This won't work for me at all. Too bad because the color and style are very pretty on the hanger.

This seller was fairly quick in getting the items to me, and very helpful/responsive when there were weather related shipping delays. Would buy from them again.

Loose leg holes mean that they don't stay in place...talk about wedgies! It was like the bikinis I got really wanted to be thongs, and would try their hardest to migrate the leg opening all the way over into full wedgie position. The worst part was that this 6 pack was mixed in with my existing underwear, so I'd forget about their wayward ways as I went to grab a clean pair of underwear. An hour into my work day, and I'd feel that tell tale creeping feeling of the leg hole elastic heading west. I ended up throwing each pair in the trash at the end of the day as I rediscovered the problem each time.
Maybe going down a size would have snugged everything up so they stayed better gripped into position? That doesn't seem comfy. I won't be buying this again.",Constant wedgies.
negative,2.0,"I bought this bra after reading all the great reviews. I borrowed the Medela brand from a friend and liked it, but decided to buy Simple Wishes because it was a little cheaper. Big mistake! Why I don't like this:

1. Bulky fabric - the fabric is thicker than the Medela brand but it's not noticeably comfortable

2. Zipper goes in the wrong direction - the Medela brand you zip from bottom to top like a bustier. This is reverse, top to bottom. It's difficult to put the zipper together at the top and squeeze the bra sufficiently around your torso.

3. Horns are difficult to put in - I use a Medela Symphony pump and they are difficult to get into the bra holes without flinging milk. My complaint about the Medela brand is that the holes are too loose.

4. Too many parts that I'll never use - I'm 5'3"", 118 pounds, 29 B bra size pre-maternity sizes. The extra zipper flap is useless to me, and I'll never use the bra/halter straps. Because there is so much extra fabric in the back (I overlap the full velcro flap portion), there is a lot of extra fabric behind me, and a bump when I wear it.

I would return this bra if I could. Since I can't, I'll use it begrudgingly.","Disappointing, bulky and hard to get horns in the holes"

If it wasn't for the fact I really expected this dress to be fabulous because it sure looks that way on the modal I would have canceled....What really throws me is I am NOT over weight I wear a medium only because of my bone structure I actually where a small in most shirts but choose medium for dresses.. so when you see the fit of the dress in the picture I had every reason to believe a large either work for me or but a good chance being too big! They must have put a Large on a girl who wears a size 0 to take this picture because either I just happened to get one of the few that passed the inspection without being inspected or these dresses are very very small... or they are made for kids / young adults but forgot to mention that... what ever the dress I got does not fit as a large in misses much less ladies... maybe a juniors.... I just went and looked at the dress again and now they have a warning that  may be TOO BIG??????  Wow.... so now you are roling a dice... it can be too big or too small.... good luck here.....

I wore them around the house for several weeks to break them in, and wore them to work in yesterday for the first time. My feet were killing me after six hours. The bottoms of my feet, especially under my big toes, were so sore, all I could think about was taking them off the second I got home.

As you can see from the pictures, these have holes within the first year.  I live in Philadelphia and we've had a relatively dry year until this week, so I've only worn these 20ish times.  Almost immediately after stepping outside this morning, I noticed my foot getting wet and the obvious hole in the side of my boot.  My fuzzy sock and tights were soaked by the time I got to work.

Very unhappy as I have a very difficult time finding rainboots that fit my calf and wide foot and from a comfort standpoint these weren't bad, but they are obviously lacking in quality.

****Original Review****

I measured my foot and calf prior to ordering, as I have wide feet and large calves.
My foot is 9"" long and wide, and my calves are 16.2"".
I ordered an 8 in the black without a buckle (Idk if that makes a difference), which is actually 9.6"".  They fit, lengthwise I have a thumb which is about 0.5"".  I could have comfortably gone with a 7.5, however, I am now reluctant to return, as width wise, they seem to just fit and the size chart does not provide width.  I actually would probably prefer a size down, as they are kind of heavy, but I don't want to risk it.  They fit my calf well, I can stick my hand down the side while I'm in.",Holes within a year

negative,2.0,"I needed a heating pad to help heal a shoulder injury, and I bought this believing it would fit snugly between my neck and the edge of my shoulder.  I was quite mistaken.  The pad seems to work reasonably well in the small of the back or across the back below the neck.  The control allows for a welcome range of temperature.  However, the location of the ""plug in"" for the electrical cord makes it cumbersome to use the pad.  A better design would be to have a cord come out of the pad for several inches before the electrical supply cord attached.  The only way I have been able to apply heat effectively to my shoulder with this pad has been to hold it into place with my opposite hand cupped to force it down onto the area.  The pad seems to be well made, and it heats effectively, but I would not recommend it for areas where the pad could not be fully extended flattened (and the plug-in would not interfere).",Not a good choice for shoulders

negative,2.0,"Rating explanation - 5 stars for comfort and support.  Negative stars due to the smell - resulting in 2 stars

I purchased these shoes from a local vendor.  They are exceedingly comfortable for both casual and exercise wear. They offer great support, and are the first exercise shoes I've purchased in years that don't leave blisters on my feet.  I took them to work to wear for lunch time walks, and around the same time began to notice a smell that made me think someone had discarded rotten food in the area.  Then I thought one of my co-workers must have developed horrible body odor.  After a week or so, I took a trip wearing the shoes during my flight.  The smell followed, so of course I thought I had developed body odor!  But, after unpacking and leaving the shoes in the hotel closet for a couple days, the closet began to take on the same odor.  I was able to track the smell back to the soles (not the insoles) of these shoes.  The smell is a horrible gassy/chemical smell.  I found the same complaint not only with other NB models, but other manufacturer's shoes.  Other reviews mentioned it might be due to the shoes getting wet, or the adhesive, and/or a certain type of foam used.  In any case, they smell too bad to keep in the house.  So, I keep them on the patio, and put them on only when walking outdoors.  They're too comfortable to toss, or they would be gone.  Unfortunately, it seems as if the smell didn't fully develop until I'd owned the shoes for several weeks.

And no, it's not my feet causing the shoes to smell.  And yes, I actually made my spouse to a sniff test, comparing my old, well-worn sneakers to these.  It's the new shoes.","Comfortable, but REEK!"

I was a bit dubious as soon as I opened the package. It's lightweight alright. Feels like a thick windbreaker. I wore it outside at 20F (normal winter here) and could feel the cold seeping in immediately and I could especially feel in coming in through the stitching. It's not a complete down fill. Tag says 60% polyester and 40% down, and that the 40% is only 90%, meaning it's 35% down fill. I took a picture of the tag and will try to upload it. Another tag states something along the lines of ""good to two degrees WITH moderate activity"". Another line says it would be warmer if you layered something underneath. (Duh...)

negative,1.0,"I've had Merrell Moab Ventilator hiking shoes before this pair, and they were all very comfortable. Merrell has changed the way these shoes fit-- they've increased the arch support too much and also made the width of the shoe in the arch area more narrow. The result is that these are extremely uncomfortable to wear for more than an hour. I thought maybe I got a unique pair so went to a shoe store and tried on the same size/width Moab Ventilator's there and found that that pair had same issues-- over aggressive arch support and narrower in the arch area. The other thing is that Merrell also changed the insole material-- the old material was very soft and almost like a velour-- made the old pairs feel almost like very comfortable slippers. Their new insoles are orange and made from a more ""burlap"" like material-- not soft at all and kind of rough. I'm not sure why Merrell made all these changes but I am extremely disappointed and won't be buying any Merrill Moab Ventilators again. Merrell's Moab Ventilators used to be the most comfortable hiking shoe but now they're terrible with a very aggressive arch area and very rough insole material.

I wore it bare-footed and at the end of the day, I got some nasty blisters. With socks, the comfort level did not improve much. Not to mention the fashion sense. It looked ugly enough, even without socks. I had been prepared to do a trade-off between comfort and fashion. But it is a no-brainer now.

Not lifted upward, but bent in the middle, with the tip forward going clockwise.  Next, the inner circle with the hours markers didn't match up with the outer indexes.  For example, the 4-hour marker should line up with the 20 minute marker, but it was slightly off.  Finally, the hour hand, when lining up with the inner hour markers, at the hour, the minute hand was off by a few minutes.  Depending on what hour it was, the minutes hand would be between 2-6 minutes ahead.  I had read great things about Orient watches, hopefully this Flight line is just an exception.

negative,1.0,"I used to wear Levi's exclusively. I'd wear 505 for work, and 501 stf for good. I stopped buying the 505 when they changed the rise to fit below the waist. I stopped buying the 501 stf when they changed the denim weight and stitching. On a whim, I tried the 501 stf again just to see if maybe they improved them. They didn't. I will say that I like the fit and cut of the 501 stf. But that's about it. I still have pairs from about 6 years ago that were over 13 oz denim. These are between 12 oz and 12.5 oz. They just feel flimsy at this weight. And the new stitching ( inseam, hem and pockets) make these look like woman's jeans. These are certainly not worth the price. I have been buying Wrangler. They have a style that they haven't changed by even one stitch since 1947. It's their best selling style. That's because guys know exactly what they're going to get - 14.75 oz denim, natural rise, 18"" leg opening and the stitching is always the same. Levi's claims they make changes to styles to keep them 'fresh and current'. It looks like they take away quality and raise the price. Levi Strauss must be turning in his grave. Especially with this style that made Levi's a brand name. Levi's could learn a lesson about not changing what works from their competitor.

Plus the look of this shoe, because of the white trim on the sole, isn't all that great as an every-day shoe  - looks more athletic than I expected.  I have several pairs of Skechers which have become staples in my closet, for their design and look, but mostly their comfort and support.  This shoe is mediocre on all counts.","Not so Great, the LIV design is much better"

- The ""One Size"" is for guys 200-pounds or less (I'm 210 and while the material stretches - it looks stupid).

- The top/back is split open and is supposed to tie with white strings but the part where the material splits isn't sewn so it tears incredibly easy.

- The inflatable belly won't extend beyond a size 36 waist.
- The white gloves are ridiculously small (wouldn't fit a girl's hand, much less a man's hand).

negative,1.0,"Believe the reviews - this is not a wide shoe. And it is heavy.  I am a Personal Trainer and runner.  I am on my feet no less than 8 hours a day between working and my own work outs.  I had bunion revision surgery in March on my left foot (bone was cut, moved, plated and screwed in, and the soft tissue shaved off that creates the hideoous lump on the side of the foot).  My foot is almost straight, but still a little swollen so a wide shoe is my best bet.  But not these.  Measured width wise against an old pair of Asics Nimbus, the Ariel is a half inch more narrow.  And my baby toe hit right against a seam.  I made it through an hour and then took the shoes off and wore the old ones to the gym.  This shoe is available in a double EE and while I could have tried it, I ordered the Mizuno Women's Wave Rider 19 at the same time and it seems to be a good fit.  The Ariel did not feel particularly good on my right foot either.  For what it's worth, the new Asics Nimbus 18 is also cut more narrow in the D (I had worn this style for years).

negative,1.0,"I was looking forward to this jacket because I own several Levi's jean jackets and dig the style, comfort and quality.  However, it seems that Levi's is off the mark here.  The sizing is not adhering to the standard sizing charts.  I have tried on a couple of these, one in the store, and the one Amazon sent me.  I wear an XL in every shirt, sweat shirt, sweater and jacket I own.  In fact, XL is a bit roomy on me, which is how I like my clothes to fit.  I am a true XL with an athletic build, and I could not even button the bottom button on this jacket....are you kidding me?  This jacket is made for skinny boys and girly men with stick figures.  It is made for the twiggies of the world.  You should order a full size larger, and even two sizes larger if you want a bit of room.  In addition, it is not LONG enough.  When I raised my arms, the jacket climbs well above my umbilicus.

The positives of this jacket are that it has a nice inside pocket, the jean material is in the Levi's tradition, and the style is classic.

The Sherpa on the inside is not white, but a blue, grey color.  They should wash the jean jacket before they stitch the Sherpa to it so that the Sherpa maintains its cream color.

I am giving this jacket one star because if you receive it and can not wear it, you have to send it back.  A big waste of time! Amazon does not carry a XXL, so, this was a big waste of time.  Worse yet, if you by it for a gift, the person would receive it and would not be able to wear it, what a big disappointment and, again, a waste of time.  Amazon should advise manufactures to adhere to standard sizing charts.

Try the XL from LL Bean.  They make a Sherpa that runs true to size.

negative,1.0,"Naturalizer once again is not changing the footbed for wide widths, just the strap lengths.  When molding up the sides,foot beds need to widen so those angled upward edges don't press and cut into the bottom of your foot, but rather curve along the edges of your foot.  Instead of a supportive sole, which mind you has zero arch support, they are torture devices, which I encountered on my last full priced pair.  These are comfortable for about 5 minutes until you walk any amount and feel the soreness happen.  Also, advertising shoes as ""all leather"" which they do as a brand as a whole is incorrect if you line the straps in plastic that can sweat, which isn't only unpleasantly uncomfortable, but then creates friction for a blister to form.  Leather lining is the way to go, for all places that touch the skin (which Clarks seems to understand on the Un-structured lines at least).  I will be donating these.  UNwearable.

First of all it was priced over the full price if you buy it from the original manufacturer.  Also the bag was poorly stitched.  The two sides where there is contrasting trim did not line up. The zipper was stitched to tightly which made the bag gather on one side. The handles are also lower quality on the bag. They are very thin, scratchy material. My older Glenna's have very soft handles, not padded, but soft. The biggest problem I could not look past, and returned the bag over however, was the squeaking noise the bag made as I walked around. How ever they are attaching the handles to the bag now has caused something to rub together. None of my older bags do this. It was so loud my daughter asked me what that noise was.

The ""new"" 505s are made from something a lot lighter and less durable than before. It seems like only a few weeks before the back pockets blow out, forcing me to buy again. In fact, older Levis with the heavier material are in better shape than the new ones, with less wear on them. A well-known competing brand still uses the heavier cloth, so that's where I'm buying now. If Levi went back to something more rugged, I might consider buying them again - but I really don't have time or patience to go around checking all the features of all the brands. I'd rather just go to the store, buy what I know, and be done with it.

negative,2.0,"I have owned Danskos for many years now.  They are the only thing that keep my feet from hurting when I am on my feet all day.  These, however, ARE NOT THE ORIGINAL DANSKOS!!  For all of us Dansko lovers be advised that Dansko is no longer being made by the same people. As of 2008, Danskos are being produced in China. It was a part of a split between Sanita (the original makers of Dansko shoes) and Dansko. Dansko lost the patent to make the Sanita Clog shoe and the Chinese-made product is NOT the same.
1) They are not real leather.  I know this because of how bad my feet smell in non-leather shoes.  I'll spare you comparisons here.  They say leather upper, but it is a leather composite.  The toe box scuffs off EXCEPTIONALLY easily as well.
2) They are stapled along the base, not sewn.  This is the new way of doing things in China, but it's not even a straight staple, it's all crooked.
3) The sole is now heavy and inflexible.  The support that used to be there, just isn't.  My arches ache and my metatarsal is very sore.

They still sell older Danskos in some stores with the original spongy sole, quality leather and premium stitching.  Look for the red flower on the bottom, a square around the Dansko logo and/or a patent number on the sole.  Those will be the Dansko quality you are looking for.  Otherwise, just go with Sanitas.

I gave this two stars instead of one only because Amazon was EXCEPTIONAL in their customer service.  They allowed me to return these and I have to say, were just absolutely wonderful to deal with.  I try not to return too many things because I feel like it hampers commerce, but this was an exception because of the absolute lack of quality.  KUDOS to Amazon for their great service.

Let me be the one that wasted the money on them.

These are not $90 shoes so do not buy these style in any color for that price. That said, I thought these black dotted were ok in person. They were too big and I got an 8.5. I always wear a 9, but you may try a whole size down. They got baggy inside the arch and leave a gap, which I think looks sloppy.  Idk I think if you have fuller/thicker feet you can probably fill them out nicely.  My feet are average.  The other pair (white/tan) I got in 8.5 fit fine.  I kept the tan/white ones. Returned the black dotted ones.","Decent shoe for $40-50 bucks, but not $90!!"

I wear a 16/34 shirt, typically a medium or large, depending on manufacturer, and am a 42R in jacket.

They are also very comfortable but not designed for a narrow foot.  I had the top as tight as it would go, and it fit, but this did not allow for the leather inevitably stretching with wear.  I had to anticipate that in the near future, they would feel loose.  The back strap was the real problem.  It is made to look like a buckle, but it is actually velcro.  When I tighten it as much as my narrow foot requires, there is not enough velcro-on-velcro to hold it together and the strap kept coming undone.  Could I add more velcro?

The glasses feel much sturdier than another, price compatible, purchase I made. Contoured lenses make them snug to the face, which I love! It doesn't feel like these will fall of my face. I have another pair with very flat lenses that just don't feel as comfortable or as snug.

negative,2.0,"About a year ago, I was offered a free Tru-Spec Men's Dri-Release Jersey T-Shirt (White, X-Large) for review via the Amazon Vine Program, and I accepted.

I have tried various brands of T-shirts over the years like Jockey and Stafford.  Some are better than others and in general, and they are all overpriced lately.  But they all have one thing in common, the T-shirts I normally wear are 100% cotton.  I really wanted to like this Tru-Spec shirt.  I tried to wear it numerous times.  But every time I tried to wear it, I thoroughly disliked the way it felt on my skin, especially on my neck and upper back... It just felt uncomfortable to me.  It's not that it wasn't soft, but there is something about this shirt that made me keenly aware it was there.  Whereas with my normal cotton shirts, I put them on and forget about them.

I felt that the fit was good for the X-Large size.  The neck opening is sized well.  The sleeve and overall length is okay.  The stitching is nicely done.  I really have no complaints about the construction... only the feel of the fabric, it just doesn't work for me.",Don't like the feel of it on my skin

I think this is a manufacturing error, but since it's only 1 of 6, I'm not sure what we're going to do about it, yet.

negative,2.0,"My husband recently retired from the military and has always like big, beefy watches, usually in a 40mm or so case size.  As retirees tend to get gold watches, I thought this would be a nice watch for him.

The Invicta is ENORMOUS, measuring a 50mm case.  He is not a small man by any stretch but the watch is almost cartoonishly large on his wrist.  It's also quite hefty at 9oz/270g on our kitchen scale.  After having five(!) links removed at our local jeweler, he's worn it for several days.

Pros:
-Hefty, robust construction
-Relatively attractive Omega-esque styling
-Accurate time (Swiss-made Ronda X60 mechanisms, like all quartz mechanisms, are quite accurate)

Cons:
-It's absolutely huge
-The face is somewhat cluttered and the multiple little dials combined with skeletal hands makes legibility a challenge
-The instruction manual is in microscopic text on a four language instruction sheet with four languages on a 12x12"" folded sheet.  Bright light and possibly a magnifying glass are in order as the three button mechanism isn't terribly intuitive.  Not Omega X33 confusing, but not straightforward.
-No illumination on the face or hands.  Not weak illumination. NO illumination. Unreadable in low light.

All told, it's huge. It's cluttered.  It's only rated to 50m, hardly a ""diver's watch"".  The watch would probably look better on my brother in law, a former college football lineman who has wrists big enough that it doesn't look like Flavor Flav's clock attached to a wristband.","Really, really big watch"

For this use, the fit of these undershirts would be perfect when worn as such. However, there is a problem with them that resulted in a 2 star rating and a refund request.  This issue has to do with the seam at the top of the shoulder.  It is poorly constructed and finished as I will attempt to capture in the photos.  Now I am no seamstress but I am competent with a sewing machine, and to me it appears that the seams in question are some kind of serger chain seam with looper threads that are not at all finished leaving those pieces sticking out.  This combined with the fact that the seam too tight leaving it puckered, you have an uneven seam that would be obvious under any shirt that lays flat over your shoulders appearing like little bumps just to the sides of your collarbones.  Perhaps I am being overly critical, but I expect an undershirt to be inconspicuous and these shirts certainly did not meet that criteria.

negative,2.0,"[Previous review: This appears to be a good quality set. I like it. There may be one quality issue that could take it down in time.]

Updated Review: This did appear to be a good quality set. Sadly, the fabric at the underarm intersection has disintegrated, after one month.

It is more than large enough for me. It is not just the seams, but the actual fabric holding the seams that is turning into holes.

[Previous Review: I've had it about two weeks, and the shoulder seam, possibly where they stuck that annoying plastic T-tailed tag holder, looked like it may be coming out. But a closer look, although uncertain, shows that it may be just part of the white seam facing. I hope so!
If the seam goes out before a few years (these were bought to replace a set of winter PJs I had had since 2004! And secondhand at that!), I will contact the seller and complain, and bust its rank by taking off a few stars.
If it is good and the seams hold, I'll recommend it, wear it with pleasure, and maybe buy another.
Star Trek customer service, I will be hailing you on all frequencies.]

Updated review: I really liked this set. I am returning it. But it makes me sad. I think it could be made better and last longer, if the company wants to do so. If so, I would try them again.

I bought them to replace a set of long cool weather PJs that I had had since 2004. Yes, 11 years before they fell apart. And they were secondhand when I got them!

I expected this set to last a few years. It would have been disappointing to have it last only one or two years. But a month... I'm just sad about it.","Starfleet, We Have a Problem. . ."

I'm sure it's an accurate and reliable timepiece as all Seikos tend to be, but I just had to send mine back.  Really disappointing, because I have been looking for a nice BLACK metal watch for under $200 for a long time now, and jumped at the Kinetic movement (no batteries!) and Seiko reliability.

Unfortunately, I didn't realize just how distractingly and distressingly RED the rotating bezel is, and also as another reviewer pointed out, there is a fundamentally WEIRD or OUT OF WACK sense of scale between the overall huge size of the watch case and the tiny, almost dainty, size of the actual dial and hands.  In a nutshell, when worn on my wrist it looks like two watches in one: a huge honkin' clunky men's diving watch, with a dainty women's watch inside of it.

Build quality is excellent, and I liked the weight and heft of this watch.  But sorry, it's just butt FUGLY, if you ask me.

There is an enclosed tie at the waist which was the only reason that the robe stayed closed at the top. The bottom of the robe will reveal all of what a robe should conceal.  What is good about this is that is a light summer full length robe and priced low.  I think I will return this item.,Kimono Robe

negative,2.0,I did not like the bag as soon as I pulled it out. It was bulky and the material felt very weird in my hand.

It is NOT a good look. I returned it.,Not what I expected at all
negative,2.0,"These stones weren't cut to provide shine, as the ones in the picture are.  They looked nothing at all like the photo and had none of the brilliance.  The overall effect was very dull, even when I tried to shine them.  They were also not pink in the least, but more of a clear to light brown.  I would have thought they were a light smokey quartz rather than morganite.  They were also placed in their settings just a little lopsided which gave them a bit of a blob-like shape.  Even the little paper box had become unglued by the time I received it.  I didn't bother trying them on.  The people who gave these a positive review must have received entirely different earrings than I did.

Love love love the photo (I'm still drooling over that photo), but there was nothing to like about the actual earrings except for the free return from Amazon.","Dull, almost-clear stones set poorly"

A year later, I changed it to 2 stars, and changed my review. The color is too dark - nothing like rose gold. It is the darkest color rose gold I've ever seen, and quite a lot darker than the solid rose gold on my pendant. When I first got it, almost a year ago, it was not quite as dark. Over time it has become darker, and although I have tried to polish it, I can not seem to lighten it. It also has no sparkle. Now I don't even want to wear it. It's too bad, because other than the color, it is a very nice chain. The photo shows the chain next to a 14K yellow gold chain, and also attached to the rose gold pendant.",Nice chain; Lousy color

negative,2.0,"After reading the rave reviews of the ExOfficio Give-N-Go both here and on travel gear sites, I was underwhelmed by the product after trying it out for a few days.

The biggest issue with the Give-N-Go is that they do not really fit like boxer briefs should. I ordered both a large and a medium, and the large was almost comically loose both in the ""central area"" and around the legs. While I wear a large in everything else, I had to stick with the medium, and even then they are still loose and lacking much support. I believe it is the cut, not the sizing, that's causing this issue. Moreover, there appears to be too much extra fabric in back, which creates problems of its own that I am sure you can imagine. It is also important to point out that the fabric is not smooth, but rather ""waffled"" to an extent. There is one area in which the Give-N-Go excels, however, and that is durability and anti-microbial / odor properties.

If you're looking for a great non-cotton, travel ready boxer-brief, I'd recommend instead the Airism or Airism mesh series from Uniqlo. They accomplish the same thing, but fit like a dream, feel like silk and give you that ever-sought-after ""feels like I'm wearing nothing"" feeling.","Extremely loose fitting, irritating fabric"

negative,1.0,"I decided that I would review a skincare product for once instead of my better half. Since I work indoors and am essentially avoiding sunlight for 70 hours a week, I thought I could use some pampering and use some ""skin brightening"". However, my skin didn't tolerate this well (I tried at the back of my neck) - even with avoiding the sun, my skin got pretty red and slightly painful. It did make me nervous because I'm very pale, and if I went out into the sun it would probably hurt very badly.

So I gave up, and threw this in the trash. I mean, it might work for you, but they really need to sell sample sized bottles of this so it doesn't make you feel like you're throwing away $100 worth of product when it doesn't work for you.",Adverse reaction made me throw it away

This shoe was a little more dressy than what I expected.  I was trying to find one like my old pair that was more in between casual and dressy.  I wore my previous pair for dressy occasions as well as casual but these I would not wear any more than for dressy occasions and I take them off as soon as I can.

It is like the material used to make Solo disposable plastic cups. The plan was to have my son pose with disc for a cool picture, but I was so upset I did it even let him see it. I planned on returning them but the company does not offer free returns and the shipping cost would more than likely cost more than the products. They figure more or less the product would be returned damaged, I guess as a result of the material being so flimsy, so they suggest I pay the extra in postage in order to ensure I get my fund.

I'd always heard about Wigwam, they have a nice website, and they have a lot of choices.  However, I was very disappointed with their product.  The socks were way too big and when I'd remove my shoe, they would start to pull off my foot.  They were also tight around the upper calf, a little itchy, and not comfortable to wear in this regard.  But most importantly...they are supposed to be a ""no sweat"" sock, and my feet were sweating like crazy in these (and this version is considered a light weight sock).  I can wear mid-weight socks by other brands and never sweat at all; so something is definitely different here.  Many people say these are good socks, and everyone is different...but for me they were not good.  My wife bought a pair to try and well, and she was unhappy for the exact same reasons.

negative,2.0,"Both of our girls (ages 2 and 5) received one of these dresses each as a gift.  They were both so thrilled until my 5 year old tried it on and it was WAY too small.  Hers had to be returned.  The dress is one size and seems to be about a 3T, maybe a 4T.  My 2 year old wears 3T and it fits her nicely.  Here are the pros and cons:

Pros:
The removable skirt is great since it DOES fit my 5 year old so they can share the one dress (since it's really a dress with a detachable skirt)

Cons:
Runs small and only comes in the one size.
Quality is horrible.  We've had it a month and it's already fraying.
The dress when worn alone without the detachable shirt is VERY short (mini skirt length!)
And my biggest complaint, which is my I'm writing this review, is the plastic brooch sewn onto the neckline is a STICKER on plastic.  Since it is sewn onto the dress, it is not removable.  I had not noticed this was just a sticker of Sophia (instead of it being screen printed onto the plastic brooch as one should expect) until I was pulling it out of the wash machine and saw the sticker had peeled off into tiny little balls and my 2 year old gasped.  How gross that I can't wash this without it being ruined further!  All because they were cutting corners by using a sticker on a piece that is sewn on!  Urgh.",NOT washable!

If this wallet had been designed with three larger card slots per column for a total of nine slots I'm sure I would have liked it much better.

negative,2.0,Not much for support at all,"Not great, not bad"
negative,1.0,"Quality is terrible. When they arrived the first thing I had to do was trim loose threads from where they hemmed to keep the yarn unravelled.

They're too small, and I have thin arms. Unless you're really petite and small and almost certainly female, they won't even come close to fitting. They would work for a child or young teenager.

Nonetheless I plan to use them for the time being because I need something to keep my hands warm and my fingers free due to Raynaud's. If they don't fall apart like I expect and/or loosen up a bit to fit more comfortably from use, I might add a star. Maybe. In the meantime? I can't recommend these.

UPDATE:
3 months later, they're falling apart something fierce. There are two holes between two different pairs of fingers. There was three holes at one point, but I mended one of them. The hem is completely undone on one, and it's probably only a matter of time before that one straight up starts unravelling. I haven't even tried washing them yet because I'm afraid they'll fall apart completely (fortunately, they don't stink and aren't stained). I don't even use the gloves daily most of the time, only when it's cold.

Dropping a star. I would have expected these to last at LEAST 6 months before really beginning to disintegrate despite the poor quality when they arrived.",(Updated) Falling apart after 3 months.

They shrunk a bit, but not much. I then ordered a pair of mediums. They are also too large, again especially in the length. After washing, the large and medium are of almost identical size. So the sizing of these pants seems very sloppy. However my primary complaint is with the elastic waist. The elastic is not strong enough to hold the pants up.

The larger problem with this shoe is also a faulty made pair--that my daughter complained about that I dismissed. Only when she returned them to me did I noticed that the left is deeper in the heel than the right. If I wear these, I will create an unhealthy walk that could cause more problems that I do not need.

I hope to talk with Amazon about returning these. It's a shame because they look so lovely on the market page. I have learned my lesson: I will not buy another Columbia trail shoe.

They are now a piece of junk after normal wear for two winters (to and from work in the vehicle, but no hard work in them) because the snaps and zippers are falling apart.  I wish these were better quality because then we would be repeat customers.  Looking for a new brand now.  This has sullied the name of the Dickies brand for us.

Then we found out that Dickies would replace them!  This made us so happy... at first.  But after spending two whole months of dealing with Dickies customer service, they ""lost"" the record of our first two phone calls with them despite the girl remembering my DH, kept saying changing what they would offer to replace the overalls with, and finally (4th call) ended up offering to replace them with an inferior Walls brand (the zippers on the legs do not come up past the knee).  Hubby asked if they would at least throw in a free cap or shirt, and they are sending two cheap knit tomboggans with the Dickies logo.  Sorry, but we won't be advertising such bad service!!!  NO MORE DICKIES purchases for us!!!

Previous review when they were new..."" My husband loves these.  He formerly owned a pair of the regular insulated bib overalls by Dickies.  The difference in these are that the leg zippers begin higher at the hip so that he can zip down to reach into his jeans pockets.  He says they feel wonderful.  For some reason he could not snap the ankle snaps on his older pair but can on these while wearing his work boots.

I've marked the shoe as 1-star because the pair I received has fallen apart over a 2 month period of infrequent and mild use.

I saw other reviews noting a decrease in quality by Skechers and dismissed it because my first pair was so comfortable and lasted for a long time with no issue.  Well, this second pair is literally the worst quality of shoe I've owned over too many years.

Over a period of weeks, with very minimal use, the seams have come unraveled.  Most recently, I've noticed that the leather upper has actually TORN... a 2"" tear, not at the seam but a 1/4"" away from a seem.

I'd return these, but I am outside the Amazon return period.  I called the Sketcher customer service like, and they kindly responded that they would forward a note on my concerns but would take no action.

If you're looking for the shaping aspect, they offer very very little structure. I am thin, but still have fat on me and this didn't do anything to hide it or make it worse.

The worst part is that while the shoes are right size and fit, the back of them are cut so low that they feel as though they barely are on my feet and feel like they'll slip off. But perhaps this is how certain styles of shoes are and I am not use to them. I don't usually wear more ""dressy"" style of shoes, maybe these are trying to imitate those.

On a positive note, the slip resistance is excellent, but these shoes only lasted me 4 months before they began to fall apart, I pushed another few months out of them. They are Garbage. But then again, I have trouble keeping good shoes.

negative,2.0,"This shirt looked really cool in the picture, but when it arrived i was a little disappointed. The model in the pic makes it look like it's a form fitting tunic top with low-key pockets.

I'm 4'11' and 105lbs, so yeah I'm short, but i'm not chunky, and this was really unflattering. The shirt itself was not form fitting in the waist - it had a lot of bulky extra fabric in the back so it just made me look fat all around the middle area, which i'm not - super not cool.

I tried to send it back, but the seller was super reluctant (shady) and convinced me to keep it to save on shipping cost if they gave me 30% back (which was like $4, big whoop). So i just kept - it wasn't that expensive to begin with, it was just the principle that the item did not fit at all like it did on the model in the picture.

The shirt is a cool design, i love the pockets, and it looks OK with a belt to cinch in the non-form-fitting waist, but if you wanted to wear this by itself, or already have a chunky waist/hips, this will probably not be flattering.","Pockets are bulky, and too large"

negative,1.0,"I have an older version of these shoes from about 6 years ago which I loved, but they are rubber soled so they can not be repaired once you wear down the soles.  I searched the internet looking for a replacement pair (via the model on the inside of the tongue) and found these were the updated version of the Bleeker. $55 seemed like a fantastic deal, so I ordered them.

PROS:
- They are true to their size, my old ones were 10.5D, and these fit just as well
- The insoles are super comfortable.  Even more comfortable than my prior pair and they hugged my feet in the right places
- The styling, seam placement, etc is a good modern casual combination.  A bit different than the older model, but very similar and good.

CONS:
- They are super shiny?  They are so shiny they look like they aren't real leather.
- I sit with one leg over my knee, so the bottom of a shoe is usually exposed.  The big gray and alien-green KORE logo on the heel is unnecessary and cheesy (see pic). Seriously... it's a casual dress shoe, it should not have a big green advertisement on the bottom of it.
- I got these yesterday.  I have worn them for about 6 hours today.  What in the world is going on with the crease line from my toes? (see pic). This is simply not how quality leather behaves.  It is almost like there is a weird alien plastic coating on the shoes that is almost separating from the leather?  I wasn't racing Usain Bolt in these, I sit at my desk and walk back and forth to some meetings.

I will be returning these ASAP.  They were super comfy, but I decided I don't like weird alien leather and that big logo on the bottom is just not really good for an office setting.","Don't buy these, unless you like alien stuff."

1) good grip even walking in ""wet kitchen""

Overall, I suppose they would be fine if you are buying to wear them mostly inside (e.g. at work), and/or commutes in the city.

I know the center panels are available, but THEY ARE NOT FREE as someone else stated.  I just had to order them separate through the website, and even that was confusing because they are not listed as a separate product on their product list.

I got this as a gift for my cousin for Christmas and thankfully I got it in enough time to order the center panels and wait for them, but I truly feel sorry for anyone who didn't.  Attempting to use this bra where your nipples aren't properly centered can cause damage to the nipples and improper emptying of the breast, which can lead to a nasty case of mastitis (breast infection).

The shoes are good overall although they are not as comfortable as AICS Gel models.
My disappointment is that the shoes contain some minor white dots on the inside rubber/plastic part of both shoes.

I did not notice this when I opened the box mainly because the shoes were facing with the outdside of the shoe up.
As they were a present for my son for Chrismas I was satisfied with this brief inspection.

Also, the sleeves are too flimsy and do not block out frigid air (~42F) well, as compared to my Rapha jacket.

The neck circumference is too tight, as well (and I'm on the slimmer side). And the zippers are not easy to operate, especially while riding. The back zipper is very finicky.

negative,2.0,"When I first saw these I was very excited because they have the cutest design and they were just the right size. I bought a pair for me, the yellow gold, and a pair for my sister, the white gold. They are exactly the same amount of karats, same size, same design and same price. The only difference is that mine are yellow and hers are white. My sister loved her pair and I did as well. Once I had them for a while, I had the habit of opening them by moving it to the side so it looks like a spiral. She opened hers by pulling it out to resemble an oval shape and then bent it back into place to close. Both of our earrings broke. These were a great size but they broke very fast. One of my earrings broke in half. My sisters lasted a bit longer, but eventually broke. The thinner part completely came off, where the earlobe rests. She was very sad about it and I was too. I decided to go back to stainless steal even thought they're cheap. At least I know they won't break. My sister has done the same..",Do Not Last Long

negative,1.0,"I ordered this blazer hoping it would be like it is in the pictures but it's not. I am a size 4 or small and weigh about 105lbs. 5'2.5"" tall and I ordered the correct size according to the measurements they provide it but sadly the material is kind of thin and cheap looking and not as thick as it looks in the picture. It fits me well everywhere but the sleeves barely reaches my wrists,  they are not long enough. The closure in the middle leaves a gap so it doesn't closes all the way.  From my experiences with some of these Chinese sellers on here I can tell that they just can't sew well as I have ordered quite a few clothes from them and most of them have been a complete disaster. I wouldn't recommend this as it's not worth the money. It's better to buy something you can see at first so you don't get fooled by these bad sellers and fake pictures. If I would of seen it before purchasing,  I would of have passed. I think that these are knockoffs and not the original as the picture is. Beware!",I expected this blazer to look like the pictures.

negative,2.0,"Well, I waited a couple of weeks in order to give a more accurate review.  Let me first say that I have always been a big fan of New Balance shoes.  Is just about the only brand along with the Asics that I prefer.  Having said this, I have to rethink about New Balance and what is happening with their shoes.  I have been extremely disappointed with the last two pairs (not even the same style) that I have purchased.  I have always spoke highly and recommended New Balance shoes.  After this pair I will not be so quick to make this recommendation. The shoe runs wide (I did not purchase the wide variety either), has not heel support although it claims to do so.  I have a more narrow foot and I run 3.5 miles 4 to 5 times per week.  This shoe although it claims its for running has absolutely no foot support.  It runs wide and that in itself is another problem for me when running, I like a snug supportive fit.  If I would have kept the box I would have requested a return on it.  But thinking that it would be like my other NB shoes, I pitched the box before making sure they fit correctly.  This shoe was definitely not for me.  I hope that my review helps some other runner make a better choice.

When they arrived, I noticed that the part that your toes go through rubbed my foot, and I thought it always would.  More importantly, the sole of this shoe is very light, and the material used to line the foot bed is not up to the usual quality or durability of other Clarks products.  Maybe some buyers will like the lighter shoe, but I find the heavier shoe to be more comfortable for standing for long periods and for good amounts of walking.

I buy multiple Sauconies for difference in color and outfit coordination, so color accuracy is important to me. These are advertised as a coral color but the only thing orangey or coral on them are the neon coral laces and the very bottom of the outer soles. I have berry Sauconys, and these don't look berry either, as the color name implies. If you want to know what the color is really like, look at the Saucony shoe box.

negative,2.0,"If you choose to buy this shirt, I want to first state that if you are on the upper end of the measurement chart, buy the next size up. I have an athletic build and I have a size 44 chest. By that measurement I bought the large as written in the sizing chart. It's super tight (it feels like a size smaller) and I'm afraid that it won't fit anymore after I wash it. I think most of my problems stem from this sizing issue.

Unlike the pictures, the stitching is on the outside of the shirt. By that I mean that the flaps are waving in the wind on the outside of the shirt. The pictures don't show that (and I'll upload a photo of this to show you). I wouldn't actually mind this as it kind of looks cool, but on the shoulders it comes to a point which almost always sticks up making my shoulders look boxy and the shirt look small.

The shirt always rides up. This could be because of the sizing issue, but it should have fit because I did order the proper size. You will constantly be pulling this shirt down unless you get a bigger size.

The material is super thin so don't expect it to keep you warm in a cool wind. If you buy the white shirt just know that you will see your skin or anything else you have underneath (like my tattoos). The white shirt hides nothing.

negative,2.0,"I really wanted to 'love' these gloves, considering I have yet to find a decent pair of gloves that keep my hands warm and work great for touch phones. But I only liked them. Here is why:

1) They don't keep my hands warm. It was barely cold out today (39 degrees F) and I figured I would give them a test drive. Was only outside for about 10-15 minutes and I could tell the cold was getting through. Granted, my hands always seem to be colder than most, but I lived with them long enough (my hands) to know when they are getting colder than normal. But still....they were definitely warmer than my North Face Etip Gloves.

2) Touch response was great considering the material and surface area they used. However, they fall short only utilizing the front part of the finger tip, and not the very top of your finger tips. I have an iPhone 6, and I have to do more reaching when using one hand. This made it difficult, but even so, I always tap the screen with the very top, tip of my pointer finger when I don't have gloves on. I don't know why no one is getting this right after a couple years of touch screen gloves being on the market. Grr

3) The sizing. I have large hands and normally wear Large sized gloves. I ordered the large, but they seemed too snug (finger area). So I then ordered an XL and they seemed too large (mostly the palm area). Cant say this will be the same for everyone as everyone will have different shaped hands, but both sizes fit weird for me and there weren't any other size options. Also, I think the XL was oddly large in the palm area mostly due to the material they have stitched across them.

4) Movement. The action on these gloves are stiff in certain areas because of the palm material I just mentioned. Makes for opening and closing your hands feel unnatural.

That being said, I paid $20 with their GRNMON14 30% off deal they had this week, but I don't believe I will keep them, even at that price. They look nice, but they just don't get the job done as much as I would hope. If it was top notch in either the touch utilization or at least kept my hands warmer, I would settle. But being mediocre in both those important areas will force me to continue my search for the perfect touch screen gloves on the market.

A few last notable mentions....I give them points for adding touch material to ALL the fingers, unlike most gloves on the market that just add it to the thumb and pointer finger. Also, the pointer finger is not grey like shown in the pictures. All finger tips are black. And someone mentioned the quality of the stitching coming apart. I can say, I believe this would eventually happen as well.

Hope this helps.",Not as practical as I hoped for

negative,1.0,"Ariat makes great stuff. Ask any equestrian, particularly English riders, and theyll tell you they make a good, if expensive, boot.

These are (mostly) no exception... Quality, supple leather. Great style and details. Robust construction. Really a near perfect boot.

Except for one huge thing: the sizing. I need the pair of boots by the day of this review so im not going to keep guessing on the sizing and return these for a different size.

I really feel like the dimensions were put together by drunk cobblers. Seriously. Its terrible.

I'm a size 10.5-11. These in size 10wide were horrendously too big. Like amusingly so. So I tried again and re-ordered in 9.5m. They manage to be both slightly too large, and slightly too small in several places. And not quite in the normal just need to be worn in spots. I have owned all manner of boots. I have purchased riding boots from Ariat for many friends. I have never seen anything like the sizing of this boot.

So as others have suggested, order one full size smaller. And the only thing i can think, is that because of the smaller size, you may need to get it wide too. I really cant tell how easily mine are going to break in. Its loose in the heal (more than normal) but tight in the ball and top. And the calves are some of the largest and loosest ive ever seen on a boot. (normal for more suede type tops but this is crazy large, imo.) They manage to be a little too tight to put on too. Maybe this is on purpose because the floppy calf won't keep it on?

I'm going to oil and maybe even warm these up later to try to get a good fit. I've had them for 6 hours so far... Either way, for these prices, they really ought to have the sizing figured out. This is absurd. While im a huge fan of Amazon, this is one item you're better off buying at a boot shop so you can get the size figured out.

And the reason these get 1 from me is because ultimately, not matter how great a boot, if your boot doesnt fit right, and in this case im defining that as within the universally agreed upon standards in the US since Ariat is a US company, its a terribly boot for the consumer.",Tough to rate

negative,2.0,"So I'm a big fan of wool socks the year 'round. About a year ago I purchased People Socks wool socks for boots. Those socks came to just below the knee and are awesome. As a result I purchased these ""crew"" socks which I am less enthusiastic about.

Like the boot socks I mentioned previously these seem to be well made.  I am a size 10 shoe and purchased the Large version of this sock which is stated to fit sizes 9-11. The design is flawed in my opinion. This sock rides higher (about 2"" higher) than a traditional crew sock. As a result the top of the elastic area seems to go as far as the widest part of my calf - as a result the socks slide down and gather around my ankles. If they were a little shorter it is my belief they would stay up, essentially clinging to my upper ankle and lower calf area like a truer crew fit. My wigwam, smart wool and REI wools socks seem to have a similar fit to each other.

Here is the fabric content from the label of the package:

Fiber content (exclusive of trim) 90% nylon 10% spandex
Foam cup insert - lining 100% polyester
Foam 100% polyurethane

Unfortunately, I have extremely sensitive skin, and am allergic to all polyester clothing. It makes my skin itch and burn the minute I put it on. I put the bra on when it arrived to see how it fit, and immediately felt my skin itching. I took it off in surprise, and looked at the package to discover the lining is polyester!  The satin trim around the edges is also polyester I'm guessing, since it was just as irritating to my skin. Sooo disappointed as I will have to keep hunting for the right nursing bra.",Fabric outer is nylon spandex but inner lining is polyester!
negative,2.0,"have not received it b/c i have to retrieve it from the post office as it needed a signature at the time of delivery.  never saw that listed anywhere on the description.

if i ever get it i will write a review.  i have other Nixons and they're all spectacular and the price was killer here.

UPDATE July 15:
Changed title of this review to reflect condition upon arrival.  This is the stainless steel/black face Nixon Small Player.

Hand delivered today (order placed July 8) by my favorite mailman. The watch was not set nor working.  The watchband is different than it appears in the picture. The band looks to be a brushed stainless all the way across, but it's brushed stainless with a smooth stainless center strip that doesn't appeal to me.  Now that I have seen the watch in person, it's slightly more detectable in the images, but if it were more obvious, I would not have purchased.  It seems all the colors have the smooth middle strip. As well, the plastic face film was missing, unless Nixon stopped supplying them.  After setting and winding per instructions, the watch is keeping time a just bit slower than actual time.

Other than the band, the face is handsome.  I liked how my wrist looked wearing it.
Sizing was perfect for my tinier than most wrist.  It is thin enough to not jam into either your arm or back of your hand.  It feels solid, has a nice weight to it and with no alterations, it slid around my wrist a few times to where I'd likely remove a link or 2.

Disappointed that it is not a solid stainless steel band, so this is going back.  Otherwise, I might have held onto it.  But flat rate return price of $5 means it's cheaper to return than find a band I like better.

UPDATE:  July 22, 2014
Jomashop is giving me 30 days from the date the item left their warehouse, which is unacceptable.  How can a buyer have a 30 day policy from Amazon and then have much less give the seller does not inform us this is a signature only delivery.  This alone accounted for 3 days.

In addition, the Jomashop Details page lists the return conditions which must be fulfilled to authorize refund of purchase price. In the email reply to my request for a return, the seller indicates that once conditions of return are fulfilled, the buyer can expect a refund for purchase price less that of 10% restocking fee.  It is not only unethical but unacceptable to state one policy online then quote another to the buyer once a return has been requested.

Also, the seller made no mention of the watches missing plastic face film, non running, & slow time keeping condition upon arrival. I have never ever received a watch with no film on the face.  This is indicative of a company which deals in knock off/stolen watches and not authentic products guaranteed by Nixon if sold by an authorized Nixon dealer, which I believe Jomashop claims to be.  If you look closely at their repair policy, you send it to them, NOT to Nixon.  This is not the Nixon authorized dealers policy, it's Jomashops.  Who would you rather work on your watch, Jomashop or Nixon?  A buyer is NOT protected in a purchase of this type when it is unknown how the watch came to be in Jomashops possession. Perhaps they purchase returned or old stock which is then ""refurbished"" and passed off as new.

The minute a seller demonstrates questionable ethics, I start regretting my purchase. I guarantee if I return the item, Jomashop will find fault so as to authorize the witholding of a restock fee.  These misleading methods, i.e a signature upon delivery takes days and it's less time that a buyer has to inspect and return the item, or the restocking fee(????), work in Jomashops favor and not that of the buyer.

Given all the hassle Jomashop makes the return process (hoping to deter you) it is cheaper for me to buy a new watch band than be out a restock and shipping fees. Forgot to mention, the shipping must be signature upon delivery to them, which is a couple more $$.  Just a poor decision in my behalf for not learning more about the retailer, but alas you get what you pay for.  It's probably defective too.

In all honesty, buy the watch if you love it, but not from Jomashop. Wish I had never retrieved it at all.",Watchband Center Strip Is Smooth but Outer is Brushed Stainless

They gave me terrible blisters at Disney World, which I was disappointed with but understood because I did a lot of walking and they were fairly new.  However, even after wearing them just on a regular basis (to the store, for a walk, etc.) I found them uncomfortable (the sole seemed too thin and made the bottom of my feet hurt/sore)

negative,2.0,"Okay, Here is an actual legitimate review of these socks because I seriously could not decide if I should buy them or not because of all the confusing reviews.

They are fuzzy, but NOT thick. In fact they are thin. I wear a size 11 and the socks fit just fine, but it doesn't matter what size foot you have because even when not wearing them you can tell the fabric is still REALLY THIN. Yes, they are soft, but it's not the plush thick fabric you want from Fuzzy Sock, I have regular everyday socks that are made of thicker fabric than these. Also, they shed like crazy, I got little bits of sock everywhere when I opened the package, and they feel like they are just going to dissolve while I'm wearing them. The quality is really sub-par.

The elastic bit at the top of the sock is such a cheap piece of elastic it doesn't do anything and the sock will just droop down around your ankle while you're wearing them, and also just proving my point at how thin this fabric is, you can see the white elastic through the fabric when it's around your leg.

The only way to make these seem kind of like good fuzzy socks is to wear two pairs of them at the same time, but it's still not the same, and my feet still got cold while wearing them that way, so good luck to men in search of fuzzy socks, don't stop your search here because these are not what you want.

The band size fit me, but the construction of the bras were terrible! The cups fit me, but they were so wide it gave my breast an odd shape. Not the seller's fault at all, but more the manufacturer.

negative,1.0,"I had Avia shoes for work for many years, and they were great.  So did a friend of mine.  When our workplace changed our dress code to black, we both went for these, without even knowing that's what the other was doing.  When we figured it out and got to talking about it later, we learned that we were both miserable, and frantic to figure out what to do.

Those ""removable insoles"" that they mention in the product description are in fact removable--and it's a good thing.  They are PATHETIC.  Very thin, NO padding at all.  They actually feel HARD.  Shouldn't shoes that tout themselves as walking shoes have some padding?  I know Reebok's walking shoes do!

I ended up pulling out that miserable excuse for an insole and replacing it with a $20 insert, which made these shoes a lot more expensive.  But now, they feel too small, as the extra thickness has taken up too much room inside.  I will never buy Avia again.  It's too important to keep feet comfortable to risk them on this brand.

One more thing.  I found no evidence whatsoever on or in the shoes or the tags that they are leather.  Given that leather is a great selling point, it's hard to believe that this would not be printed somewhere.  I couldn't detect a leather scent, either.

Recently, I bought two pairs of Reeboks--Zig Heel and Zig Tech Shark, both of which are very comfortable and well padded.  Unfortunately, neither are black, but with their custom option, I just might pay the big bucks and put some black ones together.",Worst shoes I've ever made my feet suffer through!
negative,1.0,"I did a lot of searching and sifting through reviews before buying these sandals. I must have gone wrong somewhere. I wear an 11.5 and have somewhat wide feet. (Usually a wide shoe is too large , but most women's sandals seem to be really narrow so I was hoping for a happy medium here) Most of the reviews say that these seem to run a size bigger, but I think they are sized accordingly. I ordered an 11 thinking they would be perfect , but I should have probably gone up a size to be safer.

The width was the most disappointing part. I didn't have any trouble with the strap closest to the ankle , but when I tried to adjust the strap over my toes, I could barely make it! I managed to get the strap velcroed, but it was extremely tight and extremely uncomfortable!

These probably fit well for others, but for someone who's in between sizes and widths, this isn't your sandal, move along. :(  I'll be sending them back.",Not my glass slipper...

negative,2.0,"These used to be my favorite shoes by a longshot. If you're new to the New Balance 99? series, you may be temporarily impressed because they are better than a typical sneaker. However, I have owned  6 or 7 pairs, but the last 2 pair have been noticeably inferior in quality and comfort than the previous pairs.

The whole shoe seems to break down and look very old and lose their shape after a few months of very mild use.

My latest pair started to smell horribly, far worse than foot odor. Oddly, one shoe was considerably worse than the other. Nevertheless, I used baking soda on the inside of the shoes thinking I just stunk them up. I repeated this process several times but no success. I noticed a brown stain on the outside of the rubber sole of the really bad shoe, and noticed it was seeping out of a small slit where the sole meets the bottom of the shoe. I smelled the dark stain and realized instantly that little stain was my problem. Unbelievably bad smell for such a little spot.

I suspect the adhesive is breaking down and leaking out of the shoe, and the resulting smell is extremely noxious and stunk my whole bedroom up.

Even without the noxious odor, these shoes are no longer worth the premium price, with the odor, New Balance should be paying us to wear them. I would avoid these shoes until some action is taken on the quality issues.",Noticeable decline in quality

Picture is what was left on after scrapping  Absolutely ridiculous for a winter boot. Even thawing them off inside takes hours and the snow stays packed on tight. As far as sizing goes, she wears a 1 and we ordered a 3 to be able to put on wool socks and make it through our 5-6 month long winter. They seem to run slightly smaller than most brands like Totes ( also complete garbage btw)  They do seem well built minus the fatal design flaw of fabric over the tread. But it's too much of an issue for this mom to allow my daughter to wear them. After 2 wears, they're on their way to Salvation Army and I cancelled the order for ones I had planned on getting my nephew. Will stick with Kamik.",Fatal Design Flaw

negative,1.0,I know there are a lot of positive reviews but I got these in the tan and thought they looked very cheap and trashy. I loved them online and couldn't wait to get them but they looked so different in person.  The quality of the material looks very cheap to me and it looks like they could have been made out of the tapestry material from Granny's old pillows.  They also (at least the tan ones I got) had this cheap and sorta trashy gold thread running through it - not nice thread but that shiny plastic looking kind.  Not comfy but not horribly uncomfortable either.  Mostly these were just really really ugly.  My mom and best friend saw them too and agreed that they looked like K-Mart quality vs department store quality (which is fine if you want that but I thought they looked much nicer in the online pic so it was a big disappointment to me).  They are very narrow/tight which worked fine for me but wouldn't for anyone with med to large calves.  :-(,ugly

It was a little baggy all around and it hit below my butt, which isn't a bad thing.  Overall it's a good tank top to work out in or for just lounging around.  I'll buy more, but I'll probably try a medium next time.

**Update:  unfortunately I'm changing my rating from 4 to 2 stars after washing it.  It shrunk a little, which I thought might be a good thing since it was already big, but it shrunk at the bottom only and stayed wide overall.  So now it looks short and wide.

I had previously purchased this petticoat (http://www.amazon.com/DJT-Vintage-Rockabilly-Petticoat-Length/dp/B00KAW5D32/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1428076902&sr=8-1&keywords=djt+petticoat) which I LOVE (see my review there, but suffice it to say that if you're a size 6 or up, you should buy that one!). This time, I ordered 5 slips from Tidetell, and when they arrived, they were packaged identical to the DJT slips, and at first glance, appeared to be constructed of the same materials. That is where the similarity ends.

The Tidetell slips and DJT slips I ordered were listed as the same size (S/M), however the Tidetell slips, when laid flat for comparison, range from approximately 1.5"" smaller in the waistband to about 4"" smaller where the spandex top meets the first layer of organza. When you compare both items online, as I did prior to purchase, they appear to be the same: spandex top, triple-tiered organza, polyester underskirt, however in addition to the size discrepancy, the elastic waist in the Tidetell slip is far less stretchy and forgiving. I'd say the Tidetell slip won't fit anyone larger than a size 4, and even that may be a stretch (pardon the pun). At a size 10/12, this slip was actually painful to wear. Ladies who are extremely petite: this slip will work for you, and the price can't be beat! Anyone size 6 and up, spend the extra money and order the DJT slip if you're in a pinch and need it quickly like I was. Both items were Prime eligible as of this review, and to be fair, I haven't tried the L/XL from Tidetell (it was double the price when I ordered). However, I find the DJT to be a better construction--softer fabrics, stretchier elastic, better overall cut.",Great deal if you're size 4 or smaller...

I have really loved my PattyBoutik items, they are slim enough in the waist that I do not have to alter them and the quality has been excellent for the price.  This dress might be good for some but not for me. I wear a small, I am 5'3"", usually a size 2 or 4 and I have an hour glass figure.

Too tight in the bust and around the arm holes, too loose in the waist, and MUCH too tight at the hem. It was like trying to walk with a resistance band around my knees!

So when I accidentally sliced open my favorite sweat pants back home in SoCal, I didn't hesitate and went straight to the Amazon app on my phone and ordered another pair while at a red light.  And when they showed, they are so misshaped and out of proportion they are useless.  The legs of these things are literally 7 inches longer than ANY other pair of large sweats I have from ANY other manufacturer.  I am thinking about sewing the cuffs closed and using them as footies.  But for normal wear, they are literally useless, and it would cost me $6.80 to return them.  So this was a completely wasted purchase.  Now I will drive around Hollywood looking for a homeless 34"" waist but 6'10"" person to give them away to in hopes that SOMEONE SOMEWHERE will get some use out of them.  It just won't be me.

Horrible for any type of land use, sole falls apart and leaves bits of black rubber everywhere you go, insole slips and makes an uncomfortable shoe unbearable, and after brief use the shoe starts to fall apart.  I used them one day, both in fresh water and salt water, and was glad to throw them out afterwards.

Don't get me wrong...they did their job, and I was glad for that.  Two stars for cheap shoes that protected my feet, but there are better shoes out there for water use that deserve 3 or more stars.",Useful for one or two days

negative,1.0,"I have worn heels daily for 20+ years.  I feel more comfortable in heels than in flats if that helps put perspective on my next comments.

These were by FAR the cheapest pair of heels I have ever bought and worn.  The heel broke off within 6 hours of wearing while teaching.  It is not as if I chose to run down a city street to hail a cab & the heel broke like in the movies; the heel was literally wobbling off by mid-day and by the end of the day, both heels were caving forward as I stepped.  Each time I took a step, I had to walk flat-footed in order to not put any pressure on the heel with a heel/toe foot placement.  When I got home, I inspected the shoes and both heels were gaping at the back of the heel, literally coming away from the footbed.

Not nearly as well made as they should have been, I am greatly disappointed.  For the price of this shoe, one should be able to expect some wear beyond a single use.

Unfortunately, I was so thrilled by the style, color availability and price point of these shoes that I purchased 2 pairs (navy suede and orange) and now am looking a one ruined pair and the eventual ruin of the 2nd since I have no expectation that the 2nd pair is going to do any better.

You would be better served buying another pair of classic heels.",Terrible shoe

negative,2.0,"Purchased these thinking that because they were Hush Puppies theyd be comfortable. Have had them for a few months now, and for general walking I find them to be okay. However, when I first got them I noticed how hard the back heel cup was and how there was just a thin felt padding for protection. I shouldve just returned them then and there, but I liked that the bottom sole was rubber-like and not hard like most other boots.

They initially didn't cause me trouble, however, recently I had to walk up a slight incline and immediately noticed a hot spot developing on the upper part of my heel. Sure enough, as the day wore on, a nice blister formed. These boots look deceivingly comfortable, but they're really not for all-day walking. The bottom padding/sole is comfortable, but the main issue I have is with the very uncomfortable heel cup and rubbing abrasively up against it. Also, I noticed a squeak develop in the soles. When all is quiet in my office and Im the only walking around, the squeak is embarrassing. As for sizing, I usually wear an 8 comfortably for boots, but these were a tad snug.",Very uncomfortable heel cup

I admit this is probably due to the shape of my toes but I've not run into this issue before with other shoes. I was forced to send them back although I would liked to have kept them. Outside of the toe pain they performed as expected. It's a very minimal shoe.,Hard to get the right fit.

negative,2.0,"On the positive side, Amazon had Free Returns on this item.  As for the pants... I got these because they are called 'traveler's pants' and I'm going to be travelling on a plane for 13 hours next weekend.  I wanted something comfortable (i.e. a bit roomy) with conveniently placed generous easy access pockets. I wish these pants were just that, but they are not.

While not tight, the pants seat and crotch were definitely 'regular fit' and there is no elastic in the waist.  The pockets are not cargo, but flat & internal to the leg area.  The pockets have two buttons per flap and the buttonholes are just barely big enough to permit the buttons to pass thru.  I'll be generous and say whomever designed the pockets wanted to make sure there was not a chance in hell they would 'accidentally' unbutton.  Apparently they didn't want you overdoing it by carrying too much in them either.

So for 'travelers pants', they aren't roomy and the pockets aren't generous or easy to open.  I'm really not sure what mode of 'travel' is envisioned here, but it isn't one where you have to sit in uncomfortable positions for long periods of time or empty your pockets and produce a passport at a moments notice.  These also don't pass for 'normal' pants; the black pant material is a bit shiny, verging on '1980's parachute pants' territory.

One last note. Upon opening the package, the pants nylon material produced an INCREDIBLE static field.  Imagine if the nice folks at 'Swiffer' made special pants intentionally designed to attract all the hair & dust on your floor and you've got the picture.  Maybe this goes away after washing, but I knew these were going back within the first 30 seconds I had them on, so I'll never know.",Good thing for free returns w/ Amazon

negative,2.0,"+++++ Updated review, October+++++
It's been 3 months since I bought this product. I mainly use this to haul things between from my car and to my 3rd floor apartment. Groceries, books, bags. I've never carried anything heavy, like, a carton of water from Costco. I've noticed one if of the wheel have gotten wiggly and started to make funny noises. One of the wheel have a crack. And the rim was bent. I'm attaching photos. I'm not complaining cuz I've gotten a good use out of it and it's not bad for the price.. But I was hoping it would last a bit more than 3 months.

negative,2.0,"Adorable swimsuit, totally wonky construction. The breast padding is perfectly circular, which might work for someone less than an A cup, maybe a small B, but otherwise the padding is set too high so you end up with the dreaded ""double bubble"" that makes you look like you have four boobs. If you have a bigger chest (C or bigger), you will need to remove the circular shaped padding and replace it with something more natural or else there won't be any support. The padding is in between two layers of fabric, rather than a built-in shelf bra, so without that padding there is zero support. And because the padded cups are set so high, there is zero support. Between the upper bra part and the boy shorts, it is connected by very stretchy fabric that doesn't have any spandex in it at all. The top of the suit does, the boy shorts do as well, but nothing in the middle. And when you squeeze the top and the bottom, and not the middle, guess where it all gets pushed out? The shoulder straps and the back top of the suit were great, and I like the little bit of fabric that covers where the cleavage plunge would be, and the material itself (the suit, not the middle section that holds the top and bottom together) is comfortable, but the proportions are just so bizarre. The overlay skirt is the same as well. The picture shows it looking like it comes down free flowing from right underneath the breast, but it actually doesn't go out until it hits your waist about halfway down. It's not a true empire waist, more like a super short mermaid style where it's close fitting at the top and then it widens at the bottom. The way the attached boy shorts fit is off. There is too much fabric in the crotch area - compared to other suits I have that space is three times the size it should be, like someone had a thigh gap of four inches or so. If it weren't that wide that much fabric, it would fit better. Overall, the suit fit small. I ordered my normal size plus one a few sizes up just in case. The one in my size didn't fit well at as the padded chest area was even higher than the oversized one, smaller padded circle cups, but the boy shorts were still wide in the crotch area. Actually, the only difference between the two sizes I could tell is the top. The larger size had more room for the chest and slightly bigger padding circles, but that's it. The rest of the suit fit the same, was cut the same, same material, etc.

I am truly disappointed this suit didn't work out for me. If you have a big chest, an apple or pear shaped body, or just a larger tummy, this looks like it will be a flattering suit, but the way the middle fits it unfortunately isn't. If you carry your weight equally over your body and have smaller chest, then give this a try.","Wanted to love it, but this was a no go"

And I like clothes loose and comfortable, so I thought this would work. But the waistband is painfully tight.

I find the elastic waist on almost everything you buy these days (pants, pantyhose, etc), especially items made in China, is far too tight and painful.

However, the large did not fit as snug as leggings are supposed to fit. The waist and leg area both were loose.

I'm hoping the elasticity in those are a little less stretchy so maybe the large will fit and I won't have to go through the hassle of returning the ""jeggings"".

negative,2.0,"I have 2 different pairs of Dockers men's pants that I am extremely happy with. I purchased both pairs at department stores and was hoping to find another pair of Dockers pants at a good price, here. Unfortunately this pair didn't work out for me. My first 2 criterias were met in that the fabric was extremely soft and the waist was not adjustable. I was happy with that because I don't like expandable waist in my pants. The waist size fit true to my normal pant size but unfortunately the length did not. The length was slightly short as well as the fit was too tight in the crotch and thigh area which I did not experience from both of the pairs that I had purchased in department stores. I'm going to be returning these particular pair of pants. I do have a large waist and I'm a tall male although I have a stocky and athletic build for my size and I was surprised that the pants didn't fit similar to the others that I had purchased elsewhere. I also didn't like the "" washed "" look of the pants. They have a worn, used look to them.

neutral,3.0,"So when you first get a pair of these shoes and I have purchased MANY of them; they are the most comfortable shoes on planet earth. That being said, I have sent back as many pairs as I have purchased because it is rare that I get 2 shoes (online) that fit correctly or match in size. One shoe is always much larger. Weird, right! However if you are lucky enough to get a pair that fits right they are amazingly comfortable for about a month.

I call these disposable shoes because they break down in record time. And once they break down there is zero support and man do my feet hurt at that point. Why do I keep buying them... because of that first month. It's like walking on a cloud. I got lucky with this pair because both shoes fit correctly and I love the color so much that I bought them twice!! Skechers has started to make all dark colors and with casual shoes like these; I'm all about a pop of color! I hate to admit that I'm addicted to these short life shoes that would be 5 stars if they lasted longer. Also, as another buyer wrote on the charcoal/pink pair, all of them can get so stinky so fast and I do not have an odor problem either. So I purchase those charcoal bag shoe inserts and I put them in immediately after wearing any of these slip on Skechers and it works!

neutral,3.0,"Though I'm height/weight proportionate, 5'7 and 135lbs, I am not toned so I always wear shape wear ro make my body look more toned and help my clothes hang smoothly. I have every brand out there (or so it seems) from Spanx, Suddenly Slim, Yummie Tummie,  Hanes, Jockeys, Bali and Maidenform.

The problem with shape wear is that it almost always flattens you out on top. This one is no exception. I've tried buying shape wear with built-in bras, but those never work out either because the cup size rarely matched the size of the shape wear. For example, I might want a size Small or 4-6 in the shape wear, but I need larger than a 34A in the bra. If I choose one that has a bra that fits, the camisole part is too big and/or too loose.

This camisole shape wear has a  unique aspect in that it can be worn as a scoop top or v-neck style. But it runs loose, it doesn't really provide any additional shaping than you'd get wearing a tank too. I could have gone down a size, of course  but that will make the smashing in the chest area even worse.  And since it offers zero support in the bra area, you'll still have to wear a bra under.

If you're looking for something very light and relatively loose to wear under clothing that might catch or ride up, you're probably going to  like this ok if you can get it in the fifteen dollars range. I gave this 3 stars because it's not shape wear, it's more like a firmer camisole but at shape wear pricing.",I wouldn't call this shapewear

There is lots of nice detail in this watch.

The watch is gorgeous, runs, it keeps nearly perfect time, it would be perfect if not for one small detail.

Both of the little ""day and month"" hands (the ones at the 9 and 3 o'clock positions) were missing. There are shafts there, but the assembler must have simply forgotten to attach the pointer hands.

I contacted the seller and they immediately apologized, and offered to refund my money and shipping. All is well there, it gives me a good feeling and confidence in them.

neutral,3.0,"PROS:
nice mid-rise
perfect length if you like a ""just below the knee"" capri
extra fabric in the crotch

CONS:
thin fabric
leg bottoms are super tight!

Found these capris very ""meh,"" especially for Jockey.

I'm 5""5"", long wasted, 140 lbs, wear a medium,/8-10.

Pros:  I did like the mid-rise;  they weren't so high wasted that they were at the belly button (hate that!) but they weren't so low that you would be constantly hiking them up to prevent muffin top.  Like other Jockey leggings, there is additional material sewn into the crotch, which definitely enhances the fit.  I also liked the length witch hits just below the knee on me.

Cons:  The biggest con with these leggings is the super tight bottom where the legging meets your calf.  I do have very large and muscular calves so this issue was a deal-breaker for me.  If you have lovely sleek lower legs, or are very slim, they might work for you.

I was disappointed with the quality of the fabric, it was quite thin.  Even in black, I would be uncomfortable wearing these to the gym, although they would be fine under a skirt or tunic.  The little waistband pocket that Jockey includes in other leggings is also missing in this design.  I'm surprised at the lack of quality as other Jockey leggings I have are very well made.","Nice rise and length, but skimpy fabric and super tight in calf area"

Pros: small profile and cute design. Comfortable and easy to wear.

Cons: instruction book was in the smallest font imaginable. The features are pretty limited and inaccurate.

You can track your steps, sleep, glasses of water, and exercise minutes, or set a custom goal. There are some other options like remote camera shutter and make your phone ring remotely.

I did a test to see how the step and sleep tracker worked. I'm a nursing mother to a 7 month old and typically get up twice a night. Last night I went to bed at 11pm, got up once at 2:30, and then was up for the day at 6:30am. The step tracker calculated my trip to the nursery and back twice (I checked this first thing in the morning) to be almost 100 steps. I measured it out and one trip should only be about 25 steps. It also said I only slept for 4.5 hours, which seems odd because I fell right asleep at 11pm, woke up at 6:15, and was only up with the baby once for about 15 minutes.

Overall, it's something I would probably return if I could. I wish there was a clock feature in here somewhere, especially for the price point. If it looks like a watch, at least tell me the time, right?",Not as accurate as I would have hoped..

Now if you're unaware you stopped the timer and press it stop once the time will reset very quickly. I officiate sports and sometimes you can press stop twice by accident. If that happens your timer will go back to reset. So I would always need to keep an eye on the time and not the sport. For officiating this watch doesn't cut it like the others.

neutral,3.0,"The clipper, nail file, and tweezers are a nice stainless steel. The slanted tweezers work well.  They grasp the hair and pull it from the root instead of just breaking it.  The nail file is wonderful.  One side is coarse and the other side is fine.  Both sides work extremely well to shape and seal nails.

The nail clipper, on the other hand, is a bit flimsy and hard to open.  It's also made of stainless steel, but it's so thin that its difficult to cut your nails. Unfortunately, the design is great but it falls short on functionality.  I find that it slips out of place.  I have long nails and I bent one of them when the nail clipper slipped out of position.  I won't be using it again.  I'll stick with my Trim nail clipper.

neutral,3.0,"I ordered my size and a 1/2 size larger.  My size seemed a little short in the last (arch to ball of foot).  However, the larger size had a big lump by the zipper on the left boot AND, the left boot seemed to be made entirely of belly leather, so it didn't really match the right one.  Belly leather is thinner, wrinklier and pebblier than body leather.  Since the Chinese eat so much pork, one would think they would have enough pig leather (which is what these boots are made of and the leather is quite thin, overall) to avoid using the inferior part of the leather at all.  The other boots also had belly leather and not in the best place - the foot part of the boot.  However, given the price and the fact that I won't wear them nearly as often as I do regular shoes and boots, I opted to keep the pair that are my size.  I have pretty skinny legs - I can't imagine an athletic calf fitting into these boots, but they do look great on and I really like the wedge heel.","Good price for a novelty boot, but don't expect great quality."

- The left bridesmaid's dress rode up a bit and her fabric was a little awkward. I'm not sure if she altered hers or when it arrived.
- The my sister (middle)'s dress arrived quickly, but her bust area rode up as well. She was afraid that it would be too small since she had just given birth so she ordered a larger size than me, but it ended up being way too large and long, so our mom took it in a bit and hemmed the bottom shorter.
- My dress (right) came about a month and a half after I ordered it. My sister ordered hers a couple of weeks after I did and hers arrived within days suggesting that they don't store these products in one place. When my dress finally arrived, I was surprised at how well it fit! I was nervous that it would be too large like my sister's, but it wasn't. There was a small section of fabric around the waist that stuck out a little and it was very long for my 5'3 short self with 3.5"" heels (totaling 5'6.5 or so). My mom helped me shorten it and sew in the extra fabric that was sticking out, but as she was doing that, she discovered not 1, but 2 pins hiding in the fabric.

These are currently ""discounted"" at just under seven dollars.  In truth, this is more like what they'd actually retail for, with a proper sale price being anything under three dollars.

neutral,3.0,"Fabric is nice and soft, I bought this to use under a sheer shirt, and this does work as an underlayer so I will wear it. Fit seems to be fine. I like the racerback style because it stays where it's supposed to as opposed to scoop front and back tanks.

The arms, neck and hem are serged edges which look cheap (but at least they lay flat). Even though it was ""only"" $10-11 delivered, this seems pricey for a very thin fabric undershirt. The ivory fabric was definitely see-through and would not work worn on its own, and would just look like a cheap tank top - which is what it is.

The fabric garment label is of a more robust fabric than the shirt and annoyed me sufficiently to cut it off.

Here is a question for the maker of these tanks. I wonder if the following is reasonable:
I have been looking for a good tank for use as an underlayer for some time. I took a chance on this out of desperation, a blouse I bought was too sheer to wear without that underlayer. I have never been able to figure out why what is basically an undershirt that guys can get in a 3-or 4-pack for almost nothing has to be so much more expensive when it's made for a woman. This garment's construction costs have to be pretty inexpensive - the fabric, cutting, serging, that's about all there is to it... but I paid $10 for it while it weighs maybe 4 oz. and it arrived in a small envelope. It's not as though tank top styles change that much, and when it's essentially a perennial item - a shirt like this should come in multiple packs to be useful. If it was available in multi packs I would love to see a 3- or 4 pack - which I would likely pay say $25 for .... that seems a reasonable price for something that looks so simple to produce.","Too expensive for the item, which is a basic undershirt"
neutral,3.0,"These fit me as all Nine West pumps do as far as sizing. I am a 9.5 and Nine West is pretty consistent with sizing and true to size. I did exchange these for the Gramercy because, while these fit in the actual sizing, the width is a little too wide for my foot. This specific style gaps at the arch of my foot which I do not like the look of. The Gramercy does a tiny bit but it is considerably less of a gap and looks better on my foot. I do have narrow feet and a high arch so take that into consideration for yourself.

I was curious how the fit around the ankle would be. At first it was soft and no issue. After about a half hour/45 minutes, they started to chaff, gave me blisters at the bottom of both inside ankle bones and at the back ankle where the elastic V's.

neutral,3.0,"UPDATE: Machine washing on normal causes them to stretch and pucker and fuzz. I have to hand wash to keep them from going bad. See photos.

Going backpacking in the humid climates of SE Asia and I opted to see what all the fuss was about for these underwear. Bought several sizes and styles to test them out. I usually wear a medium underwear, and a small thong. All the reviews said order sizes down and X-small was indeed the best fit. I was really curious about the reviews that said you could wear them for days, and I will now adamantly disagree with that after using them.

Pros:
- Cute colors
- Sporty / Sexy fit
- Very breathable mesh
- No double cotton lining
- Could wear them inside out

Cons:
- Machine washing on normal causes them to stretch and cup and fuzz. Poor quality.
- Must order a size down
- Not ""Miracle"" underwear
- Pricey
- Humongous tag. Not really an issue.

Although they're nice, underwear is underwear. If you normally get sweaty in underwear, you'll still get sweaty in these.

neutral,3.0,"I was looking for a new waist pack with an easily accessible pocket large enough for my new Galaxy Note phone. This meets that requirement.

Pro: Very nice appearance. Appears to be good quality leather and lining fabric. Front pocket that open on three sides with a zipper; has identification & payment card slots and a loop to attach something (such as a key chain.) The pocket is accessible when wearing the belt and is easily large enough for the phone even with its aftermarket case. The larger pocket easily holds my wallet and blood glucose test kit. The small wedge pocket contains my cache of glucose tablets nicely, and the slip pocket on the front holds my assorted keys. Very attractive price.

Con: The strap does NOT adjust to 52 inches as described. At the full extended length it is a snug fit around my 48 inch waist (as measured by my doctor the week before I ordered it.) Also, the woven belt rolls over while in use - not very good looking and sometimes uncomfortable.

No Opinion: I have not used the ""water bottle holder"" that takes up the second wedge pocket. I have no need for it because whenever I am walking a distance where I would need a water bottle I am using a CamelBack instead.

Summary: Well worth considering if you are looking for this type of product. But don't believe the length of the belt.","Good leather, well made, but not exactly ..."

If the lock did work, is it really going to prevent someone from stealing my watches?

Revised to 3 stars after washing a few times:  Once I washed these a few times, they shrunk a bit, and now the length is more acceptable.

When we slid these new boots on, they actually covered over her knee, but they aren't designed to be worn over the knee, because the back of the boot is solid and can't bend.

neutral,3.0,So disappointed that this dress didn't fit me well after seeing some great pics.  I have a small waist and for me this was incredibly BAGGY in the entire mid section - baggy does not suit this style at all.  It does look similar in quality to some dresses by another designer (V Camuto) that are in Macys - really not too much difference - but I had to return because of the fit being terrible.  I ordered a small -- i'm kind of inbetween XS and S - so if that is you too - I would go SMALLER to XS.  Another odd thing was that the tag on mine was Completely intertwined into the zipper - so I had to cut the tags and pry them from the zipper before I could even try the dress on.  Looked pretty otherwise if it had only fit.  I didn't have time to try the smaller size to know for sure.  I do think that the design on the tummy looks like it accentuates a tummy rather than minimizing -- think they could have come up with a better design pattern there.  Don't know anyone who wants tummy to look bigger.,Too Baggy for me in the waist..  Pretty dress though.

It's comfy though. So u can wear it for yoga but certainly not for jogging or kick boxing, both of which I do.

Also, although it says Reversible, the stitching at the top of the shoulder strap is obvious so people can tell you've reversed the bra. Though that style is so common these days, it may not matter to you. I personally don't like it when the stitching can be seen.

Since I live in Singapore, it's a waste of money to return the purchases, so I'll be using this, but with another bra underneath for added support.

Now to this pouch. If I pull these way up into my junk, they are great. Problem is that they don't stay in this position. They slowly work down and become uncomfortable because the band of fabric around the pouch goes from a nice cradle to an intrusive inconvenience.

The body and head pieces are great, they look fantastic. Make sure that as soon as you get it, you pull the signs out and lay them flat under a book if needed. One of them was folded when we recieved it with a pretty serious crease and wouldn't hang right. Straightened out just fine after a couple days of laying flat under weight.

The foot covers did not stand up that well to moderate use. The fabric is pulling away from the foam that's used to stiffen them. Not a surprise as this is an inexpensive costume.

The gloves are junk. Almost totally unusable as is. The fingertips of the gloves end before they even start into the branch fingers. We were in a hurry so didn't take a lot of time to fix them properly, we just did the bare minimum we could to make them work for a short stage part.

neutral,3.0,"This lipstick went on well, felt good going on, and lives up to the hydrating claim, but it didn't last as long as expected.

My one real complain is the color.  The color (as viewed on my computer which I know can vary) looks like a rich pinkish plum color, but when I wore it it was much more vibrant and hot pinkish and had more of a matte finish instead of a sheen or gloss.  I generally buy colors similar to Whitney so it was a bit of a shock and disappointment when trying this one on.  I guess I also assumed that since it was hydrating that it would have a subtle sheen to it....not necessarily a gloss but not a matte either.

I don't think I'll be getting lipstick online again because there are just too many color variations.",Color is misleading

neutral,3.0,"I've been pretty devoted to Saucony over the years, and I've gone through multiple pairs of Kinvaras and even tried out a pair of Virratta for a couple hundred miles before realizing I need a bit more padding (I'm a bigger guy at 6'6"" 210). Went with the Mirage, and while I like the shoe, it doesn't feel quite as natural as either of those previously-mentioned shoes, at least out of the box.

I think the biggest difference is that although there is more padding, the outsole on the outer ball of the foot feels a bit hard, even after putting some longer runs in on the shoe. It's a bit hard to describe, but my run motion just doesn't feel quite as fluid with this shoe. With the same drop as the Kinvara, I expected it to have the same feel (with a bit more padding), but it feels slightly uneven (even compared to my Hokas, which are mega-padded, but still feel like the padding is completely fluid).",Slightly different run feel than the Kinvara

neutral,3.0,"For the price of $18 something I didn't expect miracles from this corset. I own 2 corsets that cost $200-$400 so I bought this on a whim from someone that swore by the beauty of this corset.  So here's what you're getting & my thoughts:

PROS:
- Only $18 something and very affordable
- Color and embroidery looks beautiful
- Front ribbon lacing design looks unique
- No fussy ""modesty panel""

CONS:
- After 1 wear there's a 1 inch fabric separation at one of the front bones
- Bones are probably plastic
- Corset is only 1 layer of fabric, not 2
- No horizontal waist tape in the construction for cinching support
- Back eyelets aren't reinforced on both sides by boning, just on the lateral sides

In short, the good thing is that the corset looks pretty, & the bad is that the construction doesn't reflect a true corset. Think of it as a garment like a shirt or belt, and that's where I'll recommend this item.",Purchase If You Don't Require Cinching*

The pattern also seems to be the kind you iron on or something because whenever the design is that part of the top is itchy and scratchy.

It's also the material is not warm. If you're trying to buy a Pullover for fall that you can wear without anything else this is way to thin!

I did a ""pack test""  I compared this bag to my cheap, 4 wheel, ""I don't care what happens to it"" bag which I got at one of those discount designer stores.  I was traveling with carry on for 5 days, which I often do.  I put all my stuff in this bag, and when I did, neither of the compartments were serviceable.  I couldn't even get a tablet in the side pouch, and my liquids would not fit in the top pouch.  I had to transition everything to my other bag for the trip.

This bag doesn't have a lot of ""give"" so when it's packed full, that's it. There's no more room for anything else.  I find that problematic.  Honestly,  think this bag would be better suited to men's clothing and toiletries.  Unless he's a guy who travels with a lot of shoes.",Video review

neutral,3.0,"The compromise is between wearing boots that are too wide in the calf and ankle and/or uncomfortable to walk in and not having any walking boots at all.  This boot seems well made, but is not as fitted as I would like; even when the buckles are as tight as possible there is extra room in the shaft. The leather is not as soft and pliable as the first boots I ever bought, which I loved and kept for decades, and is not of as high a quality as I am used to. I'm guessing the boots of my past are still available somewhere, but at a price I am unwilling to pay. Over the past 3-4 years I have tried and returned so many pairs that I have decided these would do, even though I can't say I love them.  They are not unflattering, but they definitely don't have the sleekness or comfort of my 1969 dark brown soft leather with a medial elastic goring Bandolinos (sigh.)

Going up an additional size would make the sleeves far too long, so I will be returning this.

EDIT: I wrote my review quite awhile ago and did return this jacket, without issue, due to sizing. Several days ago I was contacted by the company, offering me an additional $5 credit if I removed my three star review from Amazon. I am not removing the review.

neutral,3.0,"This is my very first time making a purchase from this company, therefore,  I did not know what to expect from them in terms of the quality. However, I wanted black tights because all of the ones that I have are beige.

About me:
I am 5 7 and weigh 130 lbs,

I ordered  2 - 40den - Opaque in color black thights.

The package arrived on time and without any problems.

Although these tights had fit me perfectly, and they had that shine when you put them on, I did find that they were not made from high quality because as you can see from a picture that I posted, they have lines on around my tights. However, I did not find any lines around the calf, but with time they may start to form lines as well. If that does happen, I will update you girls to let you know. I don't want you to spend money on something that is not worth the buy.

The bonus gift was socks. They are not made from cotton, but polyester type material.

One thing that I don't like about them, and it's a personal preference, is that the heel is solid and clunks - in a way that you make a lot of noise like you're wearing cowboy boots or heels and there's no way people can't hear you not coming down the hallway. I prefer to be little quieter and softer in my footing. I got the grey, and it's a nice colour. In darker lights they could be dark green (nice, not icky).

I really like this for the way it stays tight to me, but I have issues with the straps. The strap fabric is shiny and silky. After every wash I have to readjust the straps. The bigger problem is that when I have them adjusted correctly, they loosen when I'm working out. It's especially bad with the first thing we do for many kickboxing classes: jumping rope.

Now your typical earing is a lot smaller and round tip Then this is square rectangle shape that begin to quickly stretch out my ear hole.

Did you ever put on a pair of hose that was all kind of crooked and you had to remove, adjust and re-wear them? Well, that is more of less the case here, except you don't get to fix them by taking them off and putting them on again because... these leggings were sewn backwards!!! Yes, meaning that the back is sewn in front and viceversa.  The bandages still are in the front, but the waistband goes very high (almost to the ribcage) in front and so low in the back, that it is ridiculous.  The front is slightly roomier -the area that would accommodate your buttocks in a perfect pair of leggings, while in the back you run the risk of showing the beginning of your derriere -to say it nicely- and they tend to go up in between the cheeks in a way that is kind of (sorry) a reverse camel toe!!! They are still wearable, but not very comfortable due to the explained issue which makes them tight in the back and loose in front,  and of course, I can only wear them with something on top, but never just as leggings.

neutral,3.0,"The Wolverine men's black leather belt appears to be made from some sort of manufactured leather.  The back side of the belt uses a soft suede material, and the outer side is some sort of veneer.  I cannot tell what the material in the center is, whether its a composite leather material or actual leather,

Since I wear 31 waist jeans and belts are sold in even inches, I ordered a size up.  I learned to buy belts this way years ago, and when I do, I always get a well-fitting belt that looks good.  This Wolverine black leather belt is no exception, it easily fits in the loops and has a good overlap.

After about three weeks of daily use, the suede material on the back of the belt is starting to peel away at the edges, and the leather veneer is starting to scrape away.  The belt is definitely showing signs of wear, much more than the simple leather belts I normally purchase from the local leather clothing/fetish store.

The Wolverine men's black leather belt, sent to me in exchange for an honest review, looks good and is currently sold at a reasonable price.  If you're looking for a simple black leather belt for short term use, the Wolverine men's black leather belt may work well.

neutral,3.0,"well, three stars only. i liked the design of the shoes, so i ordered them. this is looks like a good shoe that you could wear to a birthday party or similar sort. but not a comfortable shoe for everyday use or long hours. the edges of the shoe felt they were somewhat too sharp so bit uncomfortable. its ok for the price. and after attending the party its going back into my closet until i go to another party. lots of people complained about the smell. which is true. it has a very strong petroleum odor that may be too strong for some people. they shipped it on time and arrived on time. so i had like five days before the party so i let the smell subside. left it under the sun for half a day and that seemed to take away about 70% of the smell. Instead of paying few hundred for a shoe, this was ok, so not going to bother about the smell too much. Ferro Aldo shoes' design looked impressive thats the reason i bought these. I may buy another Ferro aldo shoe, but if they still smell and feel the same then I'd quit buying this .","Looks good, but smell may not be tolerable for everyone"

I wear typical men's dress socks, not athletic or hiking socks at work.  I need a non-mesh sneaker-like shoe to wear at work.  This shoe looks nice and has the solid upper construction that I need.  Unfortunately, it is a 1/2 size longer than all of my other sneakers & dress shoes.  The width is average.  I would give more stars for this shoe if it was sized better.  I was in too much of a bind & didn't have time to exchange this shoe for the next smaller size.",This shoe looks nice and has the solid upper construction that I need

There wasn't a ton of arch support, but I could wear them all day and be comfortable. I didn't return them for being uncomfortable. The reason I returned them is that the toe area looked dirty. I liked the bright color of the green flats, and I think it was supposed to look ""aged"" but it just looked dirty, and I could imagine that the rest of the shoe would look like that after a few wears.","Comfortable, but not the shoes for me."

neutral,3.0,"Based on other reviews, I am shocked to say that this top is way too big for me. Other customers listed their stats, I am taller, bustier, weigh more and simply overall a bigger person and while they found the top perfectly sized or even too small, this top is clearly too big on me, sliding it into frumpy. I purchased 2 other tops at the same time, while all 3 would likely have suited me better in a size L instead of an XL, the other 2 look good and as they may shrink, I decided to keep them in the XL. This one I'm sending back and in future I will purchase a size L as my default size in the brand.
I am 5'10, 47-35-42, due to my bust (and belly) I am usually always a size XL or larger in tops. The largest size noted for this top is 42 in the bust so I even wondered if the XL would be too small.

I cannot describe how luxurious the fur is--unlike any other. It's like silk.  Plus, you're never cold with these.

And they are incredibly stylish.

Only one major peeve: the heel is too narrow and unstable. These are meant to be stylish comfort shoes.

If we wanted a narrow heel, they have a non-wedge version and I guiltily admit to owning that too. I wanted something I could wear during the day when at work or doing errands.

These heels are dangerous.  They should really adjust and offer something that is more stable and easy to use (others remarked about the driving being awkward).  Hence the 3 stars.

Also, the shoes run bizzarely small.  I wear a 9 in all brands, except La Canadienne, where even a 9.5 is a little narrow. Like others say, you need a 10. But it's now more than double in price what I paid for the 9.5, so it's out of the question...Once again, if you wear a 9, order the 10. One size up!

neutral,3.0,"The extent of RFID snooping may be somewhat hyped, but as products like one designed by Bishop Fox show (sorry, you'll have to look it up), it's more of an issue in industrial settings than for individual citizens.

That said, this wallet has RFID snooping resistance as a net plus.

The design has 3 card pockets on each side, and space for a couple more by sliding beneath.

The wallet seems sturdy, though I notice there is a stitch on the outside surface that might conceivably break after heavy use.

I would rather have a much fatter wallet that held more cards and IDs. The cards and gadgets have to go somewhere, hence the popularity of cargo pants, with their numerous pockets ready for smartphones, battery packs, keys, and -- relevant to this discussion -- a wallet and the overflow cards that don't fit in one.

The typical wallet design -- can you blame Lewis N Clark for designing to the popular notion? -- is designed for paper currency, but with some occasional exceptions, currency is less often used by many of us. I needed it today for a cash-only venue, but that was the first time in six weeks, so I had only a general idea what was in the wallet. Wallets should be designed less for paper currency and more for IDs and paper maps (e.g., folding map or mass transit schedule -- needed during smartphone outages or travel settings).

The shoe is slightly larger than other Merrell shoes that I've worn in the past which were the same size (13 D-M) and as result I feel that my foot moves around too much making it a poor shoe for hiking or other serious outdoor activities.

Most shirts of this type are shiny now, so perhaps NB felt they should go along, but to me it removes any reason to buy NB rather than something else.

Also, it has some functionality, but not really as much as a sports watch, so I still have to believe the target market for this watch is men who want a bracelet that tells time and looks sharp and don't really care that it's making their watch arm longer than the other due to the weight stretching it out (that's a joke, no extra charge).

She currently wears a size 9 (and some normal nines are even a tad long and loose on her still)... but I bought a size 9/10 in these and her toes hang off of the sandals, as you can see in the pictures I attached. Yes, maybe she can get a few more wears from them at least but still, I'm worries she is going to stub her toes somewhere because of this sizing issue. The ankle strap is on the looser side so I imagine if I went up to a size 11/12 for her to fit better in length then the ankle strap would be way too loose on her foot. Beside this issue they are really cute and I like the butterfly on this blue pair. At least I did receive these at a slightly discounted price in exchange for my honest review.

neutral,3.0,"I just finished the whole bottle. I can't really say I hate it, but can't fall in love with it either. It is a thick, heavy serum. Once applied on the face, it takes some time for it to sink in (or dry up), and it leaves a sticky feeling on the face. I was using a face oil when started this serum, and had to give up the oil to try out the serum. However, this product is somewhat picky to use with other moisturizers because of its sticky texture (maybe because it's made with real juice as how the label claims!!)

The best thing about it was that it didn't make my face worse than how it was, but my acne problem wasn't clearly improved. So if anyone can forgo the stickiness that this serum leaves on the skin, it can be an ok choice as it doesnt dry out the skin.","Thick, sticky serum, hard to pair with other moisturizer"

neutral,3.0,"While I liked the SPF25 of this moisturizer, I didn't like the way if seemed to sit on the surface of my skin.  This gave my face a whitish cast and it ""pilled"" when I tried to rub it in.  That means when I tried to rub this product in, it would actually rub off instead leaving what looks like the residue left over when you use an old fashioned eraser all over my skin.  This residue had to be brushed off which, in turn, tended to create even more residue.  This also left residue and white streaks all around my neck by the end of the day.  I would not purchase this product again.

Update: I ran out of my regular sunscreen and, in a pinch, had to make this one work.  I found that when this product is used alone, as in clean, dry, naked skin without any serums, primers, anti-wrinkle cream, make-up, etc, that it didn't pill and it was much easier to rub in.  Being able to rub it in well also eliminated the whitish cast that it previously left on my skin.

So, if you are at an age where you can get by with just a moisturizer, then this sun screen would be worth a try because, as sun screens go, it's pretty moisturizing.  However, if you need to layer products to address other skin issues then this isn't the sun screen for you.  Maybe someday they will make a moisturizing sun screen like this that does ""play well with other products"" or that is a multi-tasker, eliminating the need to slather on so many products.  Until then,  this is better suited to younger skin.  And, if you need to use acne products you younger folks might run into the same pilling issues when you try and layer the two.

neutral,3.0,"Beware of knock off. See pictures for variations (print on inside of shoe, wrapping paper, and underside of lid) between authentic and knock off versions.

Size varies slightly per shoe due to shoes being handmade.

Size 6.5 fits well in authentic black pair and 6.5 fits looser in authentic brown pair.  I am normally purchasing other shoes in a size 7 which gives me plenty of toe room and does not flip off my feet.  I am 30 weeks pregnant and the black and brown are not true to size (6.5M per the provided sizing guide given the length of my feet in inches). Prior to ordering I pulled out the ruler and measured my feet and selected my size per the provided sizing guide.  Visibly, the authentic 6.5 brown pair had a sharper taper at the toe than the authentic 6.5 black pair. This sharper taper makes the brown pair a bit looser.  The authentic 6.5 black pair fits more comfortably than the authentic 6.5 brown pair. I GENTLY tightened the bow on the authentic 6.5 brown pair and it fits a bit more snug.  I tightened the bow on the authentic 6.5 brown pair because it was loose on the insides and outsides of my feet.  This caused large gaps between the shoes and my feet.  Tightening the bow brought the sides of the shoe closer to my feet and was an acceptable fit.  I did order a half size smaller in an authentic brown, a size 6, to compare the fit. The 6.5 authentic brown will work while I am pregnant with swollen feet, but the authentic 6 brown will work better after pregnancy and my feet aren't swollen.

As far as comfort these feel nice. I am unable to add inserts to accommodate my heel pain, but that's okay. They do not rub my feet to cause blisters and I love the style.

neutral,3.0,"Instantly became my favorite shoes!  No breaking in at all and instant comfort.  They were the only shoes I brought to Honolulu and wore them for 5 days straight, and my feet were happy!  I love the fact that they are closed toed shoes but I do not feel hot or sweaty in them.  I did however add an Aldo terry cloth insole to them, so my feet would not stick to the footbed, and adds a little more cushioning.  The best part is the outsole, which is fabulous for walking on any type of terrain, as it has a lot of grip, and is super sturdy.  If you're traveling in warmer climate and can only bring one pair of shoes, these are it!  The reason I'm only giving them 4* instead of 5 is because the memory foam footbed compacts down pretty quickly and does not rebound after the first 2 wearings, making the front much more roomy (maybe even too roomy if you have a thinner foot).  I wish they would mix some other types of cushioning in addition to the memory foam layer for a more sustained cushion.

Update: May 6, 2017.  The memory foam has really packed down to almost non existence, and for the first time I was very uncomfortable walking in them, as the front is so loose and the heel has almost no padding.  So I've added a heel pad and it is feeling a lot more comfy now.  Will be adding a pad for the front too and see if it will help.  There is no excuse for using inferior foam in such an expensive shoe, as the cushioning in all my other shoes are still going strong after way more wearings.  Therefore I've deducted a star*

I hope you found my review helpful. If so, I would greatly appreciate it if you would click the HELPFUL or YES button. Thanks so much and Happy Shopping! :)",Instantly became my favorite shoes!  No breaking in at all and instant comfort.

The case is small. It will only fit a pair of narrow readers (small to medium), like the type that you wear at the end of your nose. The magnet closure is nice, but it will not close if your glasses are too big. The material the case is made out of is like a synthetic cross between suede and velvet.

neutral,3.0,"I purchased a six pack of these leggings and went back and forth as to whether to give 3 or 4 stars, and I'll explain my reasoning for both. First of all, I'm 5' 10"" and 200 lbs and I wear a size 12 pants.
Right out of the packaging I was thrilled with these leggings. They were thick, and felt super soft on the inside. When I pulled them on they felt maybe just a touch high on the ankles, but came up decently high around the belly as well which I liked (I have 3 kids and some flab to hide!) I wore the Burgundy pair right away and stayed cozy and comfortable around the house.
Now to my reasoning for giving 3 stars:
1. While decently comfortable, these leggings ARE rather cheaply made. The seams stretched considerably from the first time I wore them, particularly in the crotch.
2. I washed them inside out and hung them to dry, but there was still pilling after the second wash, and this proved true with each pair. It's not significant enough to be highly noticeable, but I imagine it will only get worse.
3. I continously have to pull them up. This is annoying, as well as somewhat embarrassing in public.

I believe that if you are under 5'8"" and a size 8 or under than you will not have some of the problems I listed, although the pilling seems to be a common curse.","Warm and comfy, but taller curvy girls beware"

So, a 34 inch waist size might actually be 34+1 or 35; a 36 waist size might be 35-1 or 35.  Really? that's the best you can do?",Why can't the lasts' sizes for shoes be correct?

neutral,3.0,"First off, I'm a certified ""watch guy"" and own quite a few.  I have a particular affinity for dive watches, as I both like the look of them and enjoy swimming and snorkeling.  Though I don't dive, and don't need a 300m or up timepiece, I insist on at least 200m water resistance and a screw down crown.  I've got a few Citizens and two Seiko Solar dive watches, all of which are great watches.

I decided to try the SKX as it's a traditional favorite among water sports enthusiasts, and I wanted a reliable automatic movement.  And at around $200 give or take the occasional sale, this model is a good watch for the money.

The 42mm face diameter is fine for my wrist.  I'm not a big guy, and anything over 45mm dwarfs my wrist.  42 is just right for a guy my size, and a nice alternative to the current trend of giant watches marketed by Invicta and other makers.  It's a decent weight, not too heavy on the wrist.

The jubilee bracelet is a new one for me, and although a lot of folks aren't crazy about them, I find the fairly light weight comfortable, though pin adjustment took a little getting used to.  I may swap it out in the future, but it's fine for now.  Simple and understated.  The clasp is firm without being too hard to close.

Hand alignment is good, though the one knock I have here is that you can't ""hack"" the watch to a time source.  Setting the hands does not stop the second hand, which is a minor annoyance to someone (like me) who likes to set a watch to an atomic clock.  That said, you can move the second hand back slightly with a counterclockwise motion of the crown to the 12o'clock position and get a pretty close hack.  Crude but it works. And there isn't the too-loose movement of the hands while setting you see on cheaper watches. A professional diver might have a problem with the smaller minute increments on the bezel (less visible in the water), but I think there's a reason for this, as the bezel doesn't take away from the overall look of the watch, which you often see with dive models.

I haven't had this watch in the water yet, but as it's already getting warmer here in Arizona, that will come soon.  I don't expect any problems. I've never been disappointed with a Seiko, and don't expect the SKX to be any different.  Based on years of reviews on watch collector websites, this model is a reliable ""go-to"" for divers who prefer to wear that expensive Submariner or Tag to the after dive happy hour rather than in the water.

Another nice feature is the crown, which is recessed and screws down for the tightest seal.  And it's placed at 4 o'clock, which gives the watch a cleaner look.

Though time will tell, (no pun intended) the SKX is a great watch for the price, and while I own quite a few watches, this will be worn often.  While if it's not a daily wear, it isn't a bad idea to invest in a winder, the watch ""rewinds"" with minimal wrist movement.

I expect to get a lot of years out of this watch, if previous Seiko experience is any guide.  Highly recommended.

Update:  After about three weeks with this watch, I reduced my rating to three stars based on a couple of factors:
1.  Accuracy is poor, compared to other automatic Seikos Ive owned, 20-30 seconds per day slow.  After having read a few articles about this movement, I may be able to have it regulated to improve the accuracy.  Ill give it another few weeks to break in the movement before taking it to a jeweler.  Im used to solar and quartz movements with much better accuracy, I guess.
2.  The lack of hacking turned out to be more annoying than I initially thought.  I can get the minute hand lined up, but it always moves off the mark when pushing in the crown.  If you're OCD about this stuff as I am, it can be a deal breaker.

Im keeping the watch, as it will be a good (if rather expensive) beater, and has performed fine in the water as expected.  But Ill stick to my Seiko and Citizen solar-powered watches for general wear.  Having to set the watch every day is annoying.",Decent watch in value and appearance  SEE UPDATE

neutral,3.0,"I do wish Amazon would correct their website - - these are NOT made in the USA, they are made in China. I've had mine for about three years with almost daily use, but usually less than 8 hours per day, and I don't do heavy work. They have held up alright for the most part, but the welt started to rip away from the outer edge of the boot after only six months. Still, they are comfortable after breaking in (doesn't take long with the dual density soles.) I really appreciate the aluminum toe, which gives protection with little added weight. They support my ankles well when I walk on uneven dirt slopes at landfills and demolition sites. The soles do show some wear, and I suspect that they might not hold up as well for a guy who does heavier work than I do.

I bought mine at a Red Wing store. They measured my feet and told me I would need an 8.5EE. I told them I'd been comfortable wearing a 9D for nearly 40 years now... but they were right!

This pair of Cyprus III Croc's gets three stars rather than the usual 5 (given to three other pairs of Croc's). Why? For those of us with high arches this shoe is troublesome because of the strap at the top. Particularly where the two straps meet and form a bump with a particularly inflexible (stiff) and unsmooth juncture which presses in to the top of the (very bony) part of the foot. For my feet these are an impossible design. Which is sad because they were adorable.

All other aspects of the construction of the sole, inner sole and how the vamp (top of the shoe) attaches to the bottom of the shoe is in keeping with the great quality expected from Croc's. I really wish it had worked for me. Hope it works for others. But those of you with high, bony arches, be advised.",3 stars from my high arch

the 9 came and they were really tight. I mean, realllly tight.  I had to walk around with thick socks on for about one hour to get them to open up a little bit, but I was still literally losing circulation in my toes... and I've never bought shoes over a size 9.

neutral,3.0,"I received this item as a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  So I bought a XXL in this top because based on the size chart and the reviews, it was sized like most Asian clothing and ran a couple sizes too small.  OH MAN.  I should have bought a M or possibly a L instead.  The top I received is a tent! I literally can't even wear it to sleep in because I would be just letting my girls hang out the top of it.  It's definitely plus sized, regardless of what the size chart says.  Just for reference, I am 5'4, 153lbs, and I wear a 36D bra.  I am not a tiny girl.  I'm a size 12 in most pants/dresses, so a XXL in Asian sizing is normal for me.

Now for the good things.  It's actually very pretty.  It's quite vivid, and the top is very similar to the picture (something that rarely occurs when you purchase patterned clothing from China).  Now, the top appears to be a light cotton material from the picture, but it's not.  It's actually a heavy stretchy type fabric.  It's not bad, but it feels more like you'd wear it to the gym than to dinner.  With that material, I feel like it should fit tight, not loosely as in the photo.

All in all, had I gotten a size that I could actually wear, I would have been quite happy with the top.  The fabric is admittedly not what I was hoping for, but it still feels nice and would be quite comfortable.  I would have definitely kept the tank and worn it all over if it had fit me!

You could extend that if you wore a fleece or sweater underneath.  It is more comfortable in the 50s F though.  I have worn it in some pretty good wind and rain storms.  Wind intrusion is not a problem.  So far, the rain has not penetrated the material either.  The slash pockets are a little high up for me though.

The soles are wearing baled within 4 months. You wouldn't get past a year with this sole if you wear them everyday.

neutral,3.0,"The wedge part of the boot seems like it's made out of the gummy shock-absorbing type of material, but it actual makes quite a loud sound when you clip-clop around on a hard floor.

The best thing about these boots is how small they make your foot look.  It's a neat optical illusion the way the sole cuts inward below the tip of the toe, because your eye registers the shoe as being much smaller than it really is.  So that's a plus.

Functionality wise, the scarf is quite thin. When held out in front of you it is nearly see through. Therefor it doesn't do great at keeping you warm. Most likely fine for anything above 40 like a chilly autumn day or a warm winter day. But bellow that you will feel the cold come right through.

neutral,3.0,"Here is a SIMPLE Review:
I bought 2 pairs of these pants. Wearing Pair #2 right now, they are 4 months used.
I've Worn them while Traveling back roads and RR tracks from Central Oregon to California, 2 months everyday use - and a Hike from American Canyon to Yuba City just a week ago.

YES:
-The Sizes are True: 32x34 i think - though I cant read my tag, it is worn off.
-They have leg room, almost too much. I always rip the crotch after a few months. I Gotta tuck em like a Samurai before getting Low.
-The Belt Loops are Wide, Double Thick, Spaced nice for a knife or holster- I have used both on these pants .
 (I am a Man, so No ""Leg Drop"" Holsters for me.)
-They are Light.
-They are Tough against Abrasion and Sharp stuff, holes Dont Grow after they are made which is awesome. Wouldv'e been neat to see the Bros here mention that...
-Cops think they are BDUs. Lol.

NO:
The Strip inside for ""Keeping shirts tucked in"" IS NOT ""GOOD"".
I said the same thing, ""Neato!"" - until I rucked up and put on miles. It rubs me RAW, my shirt stays- but only a Compression shirt will stay after working on ground level and getting up again.
- Also Note -
Check the Picture.
These are One Layer of Ripstop. Nylon can burn EASY - the hole by my thumb in the pic was made by a SMALL ember from a Hemp Wick... ""Wow""... I did that months ago, the hole hasn't got larger thanks to the ripstop...

If you Stand and Walk around, get in and out of vehicles, want to look ""Tactical"" with the Bros - You will probably never notice these things. But, I hope my Observations can help you see something other than the standard ""Avid Hiker"" ""I Like 'Tac' Pants"", ""Leg Drop Holster"" ""Law Enforcement"" ""I'm a Marine"" noise about these pants.
As with most things- there are Upsides and Downsides- That is what I have tried to bring here.",My Simple Review

It also almost takes me 2-3 tries to get the zipper started to unzip.  I love that you can switch sides to have a water/wind repellent outside or a cute fuzzy side.  It fits great and look cute.",zip.... er?
neutral,3.0,"I love the look and fit of these shoes.  Why the three stars?  They don't last.  I've had two pair and they each wore out before the warranty expired.  I don't consider myself especially hard on them, either.  I wear them daily to walk the dog on sidewalks, in parks, and on some trails.

neutral,3.0,"When I review a product or service I try to be very straightforward and candid. My goal in a majority of cases is to provide enough information to help someone else who may be considering the same purchase.

I was excited to receive this dress. All those positive reviews I read over and over again convinced me this would be a great buy. Then, when I received and opened the package, there was a very large pink note card that stated ""...After you leave a positive feedback and a 5 star rating on the product review, please email us at ""---"" with your order number and the buyer name used. You will receive a complimentary necklace or bracelet. :)""

I love leaving 5-star reviews because doing so means I received something I truly loved. Unfortunately, a free bracelet or necklace will never convince me to endorse something I am not 100% happy about. I'm really beginning to question the authenticity of all the positive reviews I read about this and some of the other products I'm interested in because in so many cases the product didn't live up to the hype.

About the dress: the fabric is wonderful. It flows nicely and is very soft to the touch. At 5'4"" and a size 8, this was a perfect length for me. The pockets are a very nice feature as well. This would be comfortable on a hot, sunny day when you're lounging around home or out for a quick bite to eat, shopping, etc. The downside: it's unbelievably large and did not flatter my frame at all. I felt swallowed up in this and I doubt that even a small size would have alleviated the problem. It's a great concept but simply not for me. I'll keep it to lounge around the house in as it is truly comfortable and the fabric is cool and luxurious.

Some of the other reviewers probably look lovely in this dress. I'm not bashing the dress as every fit is a personal one. Since it is oversized, this would likely look beautiful on someone with a tall, slender frame. I'm just tired of receiving endless emails and notes in packages persuading me to write a positive review for a free gift or future free merchandise; hence, the deduction to 3 stars.","Beautiful fabric, cool and casual, but not at all flattering."

However the stitching on the top was horrible because after wearing it one time the stitching was already coming lose. I was so sad when I saw that. Also only one side of the top had boning with i thought was very odd.

neutral,3.0,"This La Roche-Posay Respectissime Soft Eyeliner Pencil for Sensitive Eyes is true to its claim. It did not irritate my sensitive skin. I was able to easily apply the eyeliner. I have found that it is easiest to apply when the pencil is sharp because it doesn't pull at all. It doesn't come with a sharpener but you can sharpen it with most any sharpener. As I said before, this product works well with sensitive eyes. I am emphasizing this because my friend who has even more sensitive skin than I do borrowed it and had no problems with irritation.

neutral,3.0,"UPDATE: 15 NOV 2014
The newest version of the Wind Resistance Gloves uses C40 Thinsulate (40g) insulation, with an all-fleece exterior, and touch-screen friendly materials on the index and thumb finger tips. The new touch-screen material works on the capacitive HVAC control ""buttons"" on the MyFordTouch system, but the new material also adds extra thickness and significantly reduces the tactile feeling of the thumbs. I have a hard time using the steering wheel controls with these new gloves. The all-fleece exterior and Thinsulate doesn't seem to do anything extra for insulation compared to the old gloves (which used a wool/polyester exterior blend and some generic insulation). I recommend going 1 size larger than what you normally wear, just so you can get in/out of the glove more easily. For example, I normally wear MEDIUM for all of my standard Mechanix gloves (Fast Fit / Original) although I can use LARGE just as well, the LARGE Wind Resistance glove is easier to put on or take off.

Mechanix Wind Resistant Gloves, Large

The sizing is true to Mechanix gloves' other sizing. My hands measure in-between Medium and Large. Medium will fit, but gets to be tight. Large will be slightly larger/looser but is usable. These Wind Resistant gloves are constructed of a polyester fleece material on the inside and outside, but the palms and finger tips are wrapped with a thick and heavy-duty polyurethane material not unlike many ski and hunting gloves. Out of the box, the gloves feel stiff. I experienced minimal tactile feel through the fingers, making it difficult to manipulate controls in my car while I drive. However, the polyurethane material was grippy enough for steering wheels.

The Velcro strap gets in the way because I cannot keep it on the loosest setting without the Velcro sticking to other clothes. It would have been better to use a ""fast fit"" style cuff. That said, the material definitely blocks out cold wind, and the insulation is good down to around 30 degrees. Any colder may require thicker insulation or liners.

UPDATE: 4 APR 2014
I have successfully used these gloves with the touch-screen system on my Ford, which has MyFord Touch and touch buttons for the HVAC controls as well as touch buttons for the door and keyless entry pad. The glove works through all of these systems, but the HVAC MyFord Touch buttons require a better connection (meaning - I have to push my finger against the glove as hard as possible for the capacitive control to work).

The wind resistant material works as advertised, but the cuff area will expose some of the wrist. It is not as well insulated as I'd like, because at -10F up to 20F, my fingers and hands will feel numb.

The polyurethane palm and finger material isn't very durable. It is already crumbling on my index finger, and I did not abuse or really use the gloves for any heavy labor. It was used only to drive to/from work and for opening doors. The salt/ice/snow/cold must have weakened the material.

Overall: 3/5 stars - inexpensive, blocks the wind, has heavy-duty but stiff polyurethane layers for the palm and finger tips that reduce tactile feedback, and the Velcro strap gets in the way more than it is useful as a winter glove.","Well-made, warm down to the low 30s, but fingers feel bulky and the polyurethane palm cracks"

neutral,3.0,"I purchased these sneakers two months ago because I have Hallux rigidus. The Olympus brand came recommended because of its rocker sole which is supposed to limit toe movement. At first, it was very good. But the sole is weak, and the ""rocker"" feature quickly degraded. By this, I mean that the sole softened up to the point where the bottom would just squish flat instead of rolling.  But my biggest issue is that the shoe is poorly made. After about a month the stitching started coming apart. The fabric became frayed. The tread started wearing down significantly. As it is, I have to repair the stitching around the toe box, as it had come undone very badly to where I can stick a finger in it. This is VERY poor quality from a shoe that costs over a hundred dollars. I used to buy my shoes at Walmart for $10-$15 and even THEY lasted at least 4-6 months before getting to this point (some lasted longer).

neutral,3.0,"These shoes have a leather upper with no seams around the toes, which is a big plus to me because sometimes sneakers with stitching around the toe box rub and irritate my little toes.  No problem with that.  The toe box has plenty of room, too.

These shoes fit very well.  The tongue is gusseted with elastic fabric.  This keeps it in place, and I hoped it would prevent pressure on my instep.  It's difficult to find shoes with gusseted tongues, but I've owned them before and that feature made the shoes very comfortable.  In the case of these shoes, however, though the gussets keep the tongue from sliding around, I still get pressure on my instep.

When I first wore them, I thought I'd wind up returning them.  The sole has very little flexion and my feet felt a bit bound.  But they are leather, and after I wore them a few times, they ""broke in.""  What I mean is, the leather stretched some, allowing my feet to flex a bit.

The heel is a bit wide, and a little bit too low.  Like many people, I tend to put my weight on my heels, especialy when I'm tired.  Due to the shape and shallowness of the heel, I must make a concerted effort to center my weight properly.  There is good arch support, as well as heel support, though the heel support is diminished due to the aforementioned flaws.

These shoes are good for walking, but ironically, not so good for lateral movement.  The heel slippage and instep pressure cause foot fatigue.

neutral,3.0,"For years and years I carried its namesake ""granddaddy"" until it fell apart.  Aware that most products' qualities downgrade over time, I checked the Amazon reviews and learned this was true:  those who carried ""The Reaction"" for the first time were fairly pleased; those who once carried the older version (with two money pockets and with card pockets larger by about 2mm) were a little bit let down.  As was I.  I had to select and remove several cards that I have purposely carried in my Kenneth Cole wallet for a long time.  Too bad.  I almost ordered another brand but trusted my older left rear pocket friend.  Hope springs eternal, you know:  ""Mine is going to be a good replacement.""  Learned the hard way once again.","The prices go up, up, up.  The quality goes down, down, down."
neutral,3.0,"I'm a Breckelle's boot addict.  Have not been unhappy with any boots from them, then I bought these.  Comfortable, yes. But buy a half size larger that what you normally wear, as with the Outlaw 13 Knee High boots, these run a tab bit small. Cute, yes...jeggings, leggings,
Jeans~skinny tucked in, or straight/boot cut wearing over, or with skirts, you will get tons of compliments.  I got the green after the green knee high I had been debating on buying sold out. But, what the hey, spring is trying to come in so the timing works for shorter boots. In case you are considering the green, these are the perfect shade, not bright as Emerald, not dark as military, not ..ick...pea green.  They remind me more of a sun covered mossy green.  Laces could have been a bit shorter, but Breckelles isn't known for normal length laces.  The scalloped top is very cute, and that is part of what will get the most comments on.  It's also one of two reasons they are rating a 3 from me,who normally puts Breckelles at 5. If your ankle is small, you are wearing these alone..meaning no (L) (J) eggings, pants, jeans tucked in, these  have to be tied a
bit tighter than with one of those tucked in (duh, that's pretty obvious~ yes, yes, I know I'm stating the obvious. Lol) however, when tied tight on. Bare leg it throws off the scalloped look. The front sort of ...scrunches in on itself, the two sides can really cross over each other in front and it just throws the look off. Yes, you'll still get compliments, but if you are a person that wants clean lines, wants the top to look as in the pic, not gonna happen with a skirt, even wearing tights, and who wants anything under the skirt in spring and summer...just too hot spending where you live. Summer I live in the 102 - 114 degree range. I want my boots with nothing but a barely there ankle sock.  Again, cute, but for picky boot addicts like myself, that little detail drives me crazy pairing these with skirts, dresses, and if wearing under straight leg instead of boot cut slacks or jeans, they push against them .  Second reason for earning a 3 star.  These do NOT offer anything in the way of traction.  After you've worn them while walking on cement, asphalt, and scratch up the bottom ,  they don't slide as easily on uncarpeted flooring as easily as when new, but still offer little in traction.  Would I buy them again, knowing all this? No. Main reason for me, I need the traction
as walls grow, furniture shifts , floors roll if they know it's me walking in their direction, yes I'm a klutz.  Will I continue to wear them, oh yes..but with jeggings and skinny jeans. Would I recommend them?  IF inanimate objects attack you, your work place or  house has mainly Marble, Tile, or wood flooring...you plan on these being your Go To boots for your Spring and Summer skirts and dresses...  No.  If you have no issue staying upright when walking, have thicker ankles, imperfect lines don't bother you, and like me, if you were looking for a specific color of boot in just below the calf hitting, combat style boots, and this style has that color, no one else seems to make...then. Yes, buy them. They are all day comfortable, they are easy to get off and on, the price is great, the shipping time amazing, they are well made, look a LOT  more expensive than what you're paying for, and last but not least, one can never have too many boots.","Cute,Comfy But Akward"

neutral,3.0,"These shoes have a comfortable footbed with memory foam that provides all day comfort. The front straps are non-adjustable and are designed for a wide foot. Since I have a wide foot I was pleased but they would be too loose for narrow feet. I wish they had been made adjustable.  It's great for people who stand on their feet all day but I wouldn't recommend them for a lot of walking as the front straps can loosen up after a while and the foot slides a little which can get really uncomfortable on long walks.

The ankle strap has a velcro but my feet swell during summer at the ankles or after long periods of sitting and the strap is too short, or rather the velcro does not come up far enough so I can seal the strap when my ankles swell. This renders them useless to me. Since I got them on a good Amazon deal, rather than return them I am going to stick some more Velcro on them. I just have to find the right color so it does not look bad.
Update: see pic I found sticky Velcro dots (for fabrics) at JoAnn in a similar color and stuck them on so the strap can be looser and fit. The Velcro dots are available on Amazon too, but at a higher price.

There is not much arch support on these sandals, but it's seldom that you can find any with good arch support. At least it provides memory foam comfort to my feet so they don't get all rough and chapped.

I will be using these as my work sandals in the summer as the nuetral color coordinates well with many outfits and makes them look less casual.",Front straps are designed for wider foot and are not adjustable. Memory foam footbed provides comfort.

neutral,3.0,"They are light and comfortable.  I do think they run a little big in size compared to the average out there.  The ion mask technology to keep your feet dry does work.  Drop water on them and it just runs off.  The one and only complaint about these that I have is that they are not breathable.  They are made of a microfiber material instead of leather.  Leather breaths.  These do not.  After wearing these all day my socks feel wet to the touch when I take them off.  I do not have this problem when wearing leather boots.

I even did a test and made sure to wear the same type socks wearing my old leather boots and these new Magnums.  At the end of the day in the leather my socks feel dry to the touch.  At the end of the day after wearing the Magnums my socks feel wet to the touch.  I wear a wool blend socks that are supposed to wick the moisture away from your feet in order to stay dry all day.  So, for anyone considering these keep in mind that stepping in a puddle your feet will remain dry, but after long hours they will be wet depending on the socks.  My feet never felt like they were wet or sweating, but clearly the socks feel wet.  I have to wonder how long the boots will hold up given this problem.  Seems like they would rot from the inside out.

If these were made of leather they would be perfect !!!

EDIT:
It has now been 3 1/2 months and the lining behind my heel is wearing out.  I guess they are not perfect after all even if they were leather.  I have never had a pair of boots wear out this quickly.  I am not hard on my boots and there is no reason for this to have happen.  I will not buy again based on this experience.  I sent Magnum an email.  We will see how and if they respond.

neutral,3.0,"I first purchased the black ones with the blue soles. I normally wear size 7, so that is what I purchased. When they arrived, I was so excited to try them on. Unfortunately, they were extremely short. So short, in fact that they made my toes hurt. So, I sent them back in exchange for a pair 1/2 a size larger. They didn't have the black in this size, so I got the grey and pink ones. No, the color is not red...it is a rather hot pink.

Even these are half a size larger, they are still shorter than I'd expected. My big toes still touch the front of the shoes but not uncomfortable so. I decided to keep them anyway. They are light and easy to slip on, which is what I was looking for. The band holds my feet comfortably in the shoes without being too constricting. I can walk rather long distances in them and not feel discomfort. Soles look like they will last for a while. My husband commented that the soles looked like the tread on snow tires.

On the negative side, the tops are made of material (only part way are they suede) and I am afraid my feet will get wet if I wear them outside in bad weather. They have absolutely no support. Although the inside material is comfortable, my arches were without any support. For an ostensible walking shoe, I thought this was ludicrous. I finally bought a pair of arch support inserts that I keep in the shoes. And, I am glad I didn't pay a lot of money for them. That's the reason I gave them 3 stars.

All in all, they are great shoes for kicking around the house. Once I put in the inserts, I use them as walking shoes because of their lightness and how the strap holds my foot in. Will I buy them again? Maybe....it all depends on how long this pair lasts and the price then.",Good shoe but has its shortcomings

Although the fit is a little too tight for my fat head, I purchased it for my daughter and it fits her comfortably, if a bit loosely.

As popular as this helmet is with people buying their first batch of beekeeping equipment though, I'm not sure I would recommend it for that use. The plastic shell is lightweight, comfortable in the heat, and keeps bees off the scalp, but the smooth surface does not ""hold"" onto the elasticized hem of the beekeeper's veil, so it slips and slides as we work near the hive. That could turn out to be really problematic.

neutral,3.0,"Things I like about these stockings... #1 they are actually my skin tone... As I have gotten older (I'm in my early 30s) I have embraced my fair skin tone and I try to avoid getting too much sun (and my legs never tanned anyway). I have always bought the barely there color, because in stores it usually is the lightest color. This has always baffled me quite a bit because I don't really view myself as being pale, or porcelain... I even have a couple of friends with fairer skin.. but I was SO pleased with this color. They look nude on my skin.

Things I don't like about these stockings. I have only been able to wear each pair 2-3 times before they are just shredded. I'm not sure why this is happening, I buy other hanes stockings and don't have this issue, but the material feels less silky and all of a sudden I just get a big hole and there is no option of just spraying hairspray or putting a dab of clear nail polish to stop the run for the remainder of the day. As a bonus: since the stockings are so close to my skin color, it is barely noticeable when I get these catastrophic runs.

The stockings I have been sent are definitely not control top.... The package says they are... but these just feel like regular stockings at the waist...

This review started out as a 4, because that is how much I love the color... but based on the limited times I can wear them and not living up to their product description, I knocked it down to 3 stars...

The other thing is, if you put this on under a tight or fitted dress or shirt, you can see the bulkiness of the steel boned lines by the eyelets.  The material in the back is very bra-like/stretchy, the front is corset like and comfortable.  I normally wear a M-L shirt (depending on the style) and 38 bra, so again, going by the reviews I ordered the XXL.  I'm going to exchange it for an XL to see how that works out.

neutral,3.0,"It's a cute shoe - versatile enough to dress up jeans or compliment semi-formal wear. The bottom has a tough, felt texture to prevent slipping. Strap is stretch for secure fit. The sole is not cushioned, so budget your standing/walking time in these pumps accordingly. IMHO, the color is a little off in a good way. The picture makes this ""dark gray"" look a bit more muted brown. But what I received really is classy dark gray.

I was thrilled to find a 6 1/2 Wide (tricky size to find).  The size stamp says it's wide, but apparently I need a double-wide in this brand. Maybe if I wear them 20 minutes at a time, they'll start fitting okay.

I haven't decided if I'm going to return them or not. This is my 2nd shoe purchase online, and it's always a risk. But what brick-and-mortar store carries pumps in wide, half-sizes??

However, the strap that goes across the upper part of the foot is too narrow.  This prevents the foot from being able to get far enough into the sandal.  As a result, there is space left in front of the toes, and the heel hangs off in the air.  I've contemplated in getting these in 2 sizes larger than what I normally wear, but decided against it.

positive,4.0,"I've worn this one piece swim suit several times now and it's a decent, inexpensive suit that fits a longer torso and has moderate coverage. I like the mesh panel because it adds a slight sexiness without over exposing. The suit has thin modesty cups in the bust and the straps are adjustable. The problem I've had is that the pink dye runs every time I'm out of the water. It has rubbed off on my cover up clothing (but thankfully washes out easily) when my suit is still wet, or drips when I hang the suit to dry. Also, there seems to be an excessive amount of material where the crotch is, like it bunches up. I could probably have this area taken in but just haven't put forth the effort. The product was inexpensive, and I don't expect it to last more than one or two seasons, but I would buy another due to it being a stylish one piece that actual fits my long torso.","Pro: Stylish, inexpensive, excellent for long torso.

positive,4.0,"Ok, here we go. I have been dying to do this review... I have a ring that is size 7. I have a ring finger that is a size 6-6.5 and a middle finger that is a 7.5. I need to up the size of the ring or reduce it but either way it doesn't fit. $30 to enlarge (or reduce) it professionally by resizing or $15 to reduce it with ""plastic"". Interesting concept so I figured... what have I got to lose. I have other rings that are 1/2 sizes to big also.

Well, I got the product and read the directions carefully. I bent the hanging hook up and anchored the card under a heavy book for extra stability. I opened the can and peeled back the film and looked at the contents. Relatively clear and sticky... hmm, ok. I took the ring but the face in my thumb and middle finger and dipped about 1/2 way in and sort of scooped it forward. I got a good glob on the inside and coated the outside. I checked to make sure the edges were covered and hung it on the hook. Now here is where I think people get into trouble. I left it alone for 2 days. When I got home from my weekend vacation I looked at it and it seemed flat inside. No glob at all. It had settled into a well. I put the ring on and felt the texture of the the product. It has a certain kind of rubbery texture that seems to give it some gripping power. Still, it is a little big so I dipped it again. Instructions say you can so here we go again. I followed the same procedure and waited 24hours. I put the ring on this morning and it isn't tight and has that rubbery gripping power and is kind of comfortable. I can dip it again but I am happy right here.

Now, you don't want to go rubbing on the edges because they will come up and will be rubbery ( I think the name of ""plastic"" they use is a bit of a misnomer) If you wash your hands, the ring will feel a little slick. Just take the ring off and dry your hands well and put it back on- no problem. I think this might last for a bunch of wearings. I don't intend to wear it every day. This is just a right hand ring anyway. I have lots of them. I have included pictures so you can see what this stuff looks like. You can see that there is no mess on the front of the ring. You can also see that if rubbed it will peel up a bit but I think in a few weeks after wearing it a few times I will just redip or peel the current coat off and redo the application. I hope you like this product. I think it is kind of handy. I don't like the metal clips you can install in your ring because they can come loose and scratch you and the plastic round things have a habit of falling out when I take the ring off or the ring slides in a circle on my finger. I hope this helps some of the unhappy people too. Try it again and see if it works better.",Works for half size increases very well.

Something that wasn't obvious immediately, the back is lightly knit to have a scrunched look. It isn't a smooth texture all around and is pinched, but it is still stylish and comfortable to wear. It just has a distinct front and back, which isn't that common for a beanie without a logo or image.",It's a great summer hat as it is a very open weave ...

You will not regret it.
positive,5.0,"I was worried when I ordered this shoe that it might not fit because I saw so many reviews either saying it ran small or large or narrow or wide.  It just confused me completely.  Well my verdict: this shoe is true to size.  I'm not comparing with other NB shoes or how they fit, just simply with my true shoe size.  In athletic shoes I often have to go up a half size (definitely true with Nike, Brooks and other brands). I did not need to with these.  I have flat, wide feet so shoes can often feel too narrow in the width but these feel fine. So if you're trying to figure out what size to order, think of your normal shoe size and go with it.

These shoes look great and they are extremely light. The bottom feels very firm and supportive.  I over pronate so I need shoes with a lot of support.  These don't have quite as much as I need just in the arches, but if you aren't a severe overpronator as I am, these should be a perfect for you.  The bottom feels extra sturdy and just wearing them is comfortable because they are so light and yet so supportive. I plan to wear these often, and will let you know of any discomfort I may have in my feet after being in them a while, and also if there are any durability issues.  I have these in the gray and they are very pretty shoes. Definite recommend.","Good Fit, Supportive Nice Looking Shoe"

positive,5.0,"Over the years I've become a real fan of automatics. I don't mind adjusting the day at the end of the month when needed and if I leave it off for long enough that it needs to be reset I regard that as no big deal. It's much better than the hassle of replacing batteries in a quartz, especially if it's a dive watch and needs to be water tested every time (becomes expensive and frankly is a hassle/complication I can live without). Plus the smooth sweep of the second hand on autos is just plain cool. So I do come into this with a bit of a bias that this kind of watch is pretty neat.

This Seiko is a very classic design for a dive watch and the execution is just what you expect from Seiko - very nice. The rubber band is extremely comfortable. I've seen pics of this watch with the oyster band and that looks really cool too but this rubber one is so comfortable I doubt that I'd bother with a stainless band for this watch, even as an alternate. I found that the shape/corrugation of the band is such that I can shower with it on in a pinch and that's fine (will come in handy at the gym where I am always losing track of time if I don't have a watch on). The crown at 4:00 instead of the more usual 3:00 is a thoughtful touch from a functionality/comfort point of view. Definitely contributes to the comfort of the watch while you're doing things.

This is only about my 3rd auto and while I'm happy with the other autos I've picked up over the years (they each have their thing that they are great for) I wish I had gotten this one sooner. It's so comfortable, that I'm having to restrain myself from grabbing the Pepsi version of this nice Seiko for color/variety. I'll get to that later I'm pretty sure.",Nice watch is an understatement.
positive,5.0,My search for a good fitting shoe is always difficult. I have had success with Saucony before so I tried again. I was not disappointed! The fit was perfect.

I'm a Size 14 and ordered a xxl. That one didn't fit ...unless I loosened the laces and didn't use the modest panel, but I felt like it was to open. So I ordered this black one in xxxl..the first one was beige and black and did not come in a bigger size. This one was just as beautiful and fit better. It's not easy to put on. I needed help. I was hoping to just be able to snatched it all in the front with the clasps but it was impossible. Once I would get two snapped, the others would pop open. So unlacing and relaxing was the only way. Once it was on, it was snug and comfortable. Very flattering.",Those asian sizes!!!

positive,5.0,"I have a hard time finding jeans that fit (and compliment) my middle aged body, and I'm so glad I tried these.  I love that the waist comes up to my natural waistline, and I love the skinny legs on these!  They make my rear end look good (well, as good as 4 kids and 53 years can look), and for once I have pant legs that fit and flatter my thinner hips and legs.  These also fit true to size on me, and have just enough stretch in them to still be comfortable after Thanksgiving dinner. I'm 5-4 and the medium length was perfect.  These aren't ""old lady"" jeans but they're also not something my college-age daughter would like.

There's no muffin top showing, no bulges or gaps at the waist or thighs, and really I don't think I've found jeans that fit me this well since I was in my 20s.  I wish they came in more colors (other than various shades of blue) because I'd buy one of each!

She said if I over-do it, just toss it back in the dryer for 5 more min. and it will go back to it's original shape. I did as she said, it worked perfect and that's what I have done with a couple of my other pair too. How incredible is that----I call them my ""heat to fit"" sandals!

positive,4.0,"I loveeeeee this classic Barbie swimsuit! It's so retro lol. I ordered a medium, and I'm 5'2 126 lbs. One pieces never seem to fit my torso and tummy right, so I tried the medium and I love it! It's somewhat high cut, but doesn't show too too much, and there's a little cheekage in the back too with a very low cut back :-)....the material is good as well. I recommend purchasing this suit!",So cute and retro!
positive,4.0,Very cute color and material. Versatile to wear during any season (except snow of course) and it fits well and isn't too tight which is a plus especially since I have fat feet.

I am 5'5"" tall, 125 lb and i usually wear size 3 or 5. so for these shorts I ordered 5. and it fit nicely. maybe 3 would be ok as well just a bit tighter, but 5 is also not lose.
but the most I love the high rise of these shorts that hide the love handles and make the overall look a bit smoother.
very satisfied with my purchase.",love the high rise

positive,4.0,I like these but they are a light weight hold.  If you want a tighter firmer hold I would look elsewhere but these are nice for under skirts for not letting legs rub together.  They are silky so do not bunch up your dress and allow the dress to fall smoothly.  I would buy again for a underwear alternative compared to shapewear that you want to hold all the bulges in.,I like these but they are a light weight hold
positive,5.0,"I have owned about 4 pairs of these shoes.  They have a sturdy sole that in my experience will not crack or separate from the upper leather. The leather is soft and supple and very comfortable.  The leather color is an attractive brown.  The laces are thick and easy to tie.  These can be your everyday work shoe, a casual shoe, and even a walking shoe - versatility is built into this shoe.
They are expensive, but I find that with proper care they last many years.  I have had some for over 10 years.  I use a brown dye and brown polish as they become scuffed to keep them in optimum shape.

positive,4.0,"I should've noticed in the picture that the body was shorter than the sleeves... I also noticed that the body area is wider than I expected.

positive,4.0,"Item was nicer than I anticipated, and longer than other reviews were implying:  came down to mid thigh for my daughter (5'7""). The fabric was nicer than I thought and the overall construction very good.  My only complaint was the wings were a little bent and it was not easy to iron them flat.  I had to take the dress in for her, but we expected that since there was no xs option. She wore it for a Halloween social where people dressed either in costume or semi-formal and this straddled the line (she painted her face as a skeleton).  While a bit on the quirky side, this dress is nice enough to wear on a regular basis.",Nice
positive,4.0,Love the design and the ability to match my familys pjs. Unfortunately these are rather scratchy material in my opinion but soften when washing/drying. The sizing is off - my sleeves were incredibly short (2-3 inches above wrist after drying) and the legs were short as well. The waist fit slightly larger than expected. I usually wear a small in clothing and purchased a small in these. Hopefully if you do not dry pjs they will retain size,Cute but shrink
positive,5.0,"Calvin probably won't like this, but this brief is essentially the worlds most comfortable jock-strap.  I don't care about fashion, but with all the running and biking I do (triathlon training), these make a big difference.

The fabric on is soft, stretchy, and a bit clingy.  It has extremely flat seams.  After a 50mi bike and 10mi run, I felt nothing at all.  No, I wasn't saddle-numb.  It was the underwear.  They were soaked (of course), but even full of sweat they hadn't dug in anywhere.  This was a pretty big surprise.  Normally, water + fabric + movement yields annoyed skin or at least a pressure-point or two.

For comparison, I used to wear&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Calvin-Klein-Men-s-3-Pack-Low-Rise-Brief-Basic-Recolor/dp/B001283MZO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Calvin Klein Men's 3 Pack Low Rise Brief Basic Recolor</a>.  I have a few of that exact type and many of similar style (all cotton).  Outside of running & biking, there isn't much difference between cotton and CK-Ones.  For road-work, though, the difference is phenomenal.

Unfortunately, I don't know how long the CK-Ones will last.  I've only been using them for a little while.  I ordered a bunch more and pray they'll last at least as long their cotton predecessors.

--

Edit: I read a review about these shrinking in the wash.  Mine have shown zero discernible shrinking.  However, they are small.  My waist is 31~32.  I bought size ""M"" (31-33).  They're almost too small.  If my waist was 32~33, I'd have to use size ""L"" instead.  If you're on the upper edge of a size range, I'd suggest trying both the recommended size and size+1 before ordering a lot of these.",Very comfortable
positive,4.0,"Just received them. Fit is OK. I would like the sleeves a little longer, but the length is good. You get a heat transfer logo on the Left sleeve. Obviously would prefer the embroidered one but at this price, that it what you get. The length is a bit long, but for casual wear like I will use them it's fine. Material is medium weight and I'll have to see how they hold up after a few washes. Overall I'm happy with them so far.",Good for the price

positive,5.0,"I love this bag.  It's perfect for a 2-3 day business trip (if you pack light).  It is shorter than most bags, so it always fits into the overhead bin wheels first, even in smaller planes.  It is also less likely to get taken by the gate agent to save space on smaller planes.  The wheels seem to be sturdier than most spinners and roll smoothly even over rough ground.  There is also a gel pad under the handle, making it comfortable to pull when heavy or with a second bag on the handle.

Also, the straps are presewn and a little tight on me, as I have a high instep. I might have sewed a little looser or placed them differently, if I'd had the option.

positive,5.0,"I just received this 30 minutes ago, but my first impression is that it's a better deal at a higher quality than I expected. The face is large enough that I can read it w/o my glasses. It looks and feels sturdy. The battery model, as another reviewer mentioned, is stamped on the back of the watch, and a similar feature is that the band's width--24mm--is written on the band. Finally, most cheap watches have soft faces, meaning they scratch up in no time; this one is said to have a harder face. Now, if only the battery will last a few years...

update: months have past. the watch keeps time to about 15 seconds/month. as clumsy and as active as i am, the watches' face could easily be scratched beyond usability, and yet there isn't a scratch visible. i wear the watch 24/7, meaning in the rain and in the shower, and not only is the mechanism well-sealed, but the watch band still looks new.",first impression: well worth it... and update

positive,5.0,"This is one of two products I've ever bought where the reviews were so over the top I was suspicious. But frankly, 2 years now after I started wearing them, I have to agree. The PrAna Zion pants (and shorts; and zip offs) have now become my goto for almost too many occasions. Winter Backpacking? Check. Somehow they keep me warm enough. Summer backpacking? Check. (ok, maybe I'll switch to my zipoffs, but same model). Shoulder season hiking? Check. Climbing in the gym? Sure. Business wear for trips? Check. (Tomorrow I'm giving a speech in front of 250 people in them.) Everyday fave pants? Check. It's just kinda absurd how well these work for so many situations. Belt? No need, the pull tab tightener works well. Side pocket never billows so they don't even come across as having a cargo pocket. Flap on wallet pocket is super handy too. Stains? It's like they're made of teflon, and a small brush and water will usually take out anything that's somehow stuck on. They are NOT nylony feeling, NO loud rustling, just regular feeling pants yet still super water resistant. I will say there's one mod I make, I take em to the tailor to get the lower legs narrowed a bit. But after that I just wear them to death.... only they never seem to die.

positive,4.0,"These pants are very cute.  They are a little too small for me but then, I'm an adult who is small enough to fit in XL girls sizes much of the time, so I tried them.  They do fit, and are fairly comfortable.... but I would suggest ordering the largest size you can, so that they will stretch less when wearing...because when these pants stretch, some of the color is lost a little in the flowers and the background.  When the material stretches, you can see a whiter part of the material in the weave of the fabric a little more... It is not very noticeable... but essentially the colors will dull some the more these pants stretch... so for more vibrant pants... I would suggest ordering up in size.  Then the pants will last longer also for growing children, who for sure will not be happy about growing out of these pants!",Cute pants... consider ordering up in size....

positive,5.0,"I don't know where to begin.
Let's see...
I see a lot questions and comments regarding the manufacturing of Manitobah Mukluk (MM) products. Just FYI, like any high output manufacturer, MM does outsource. Specifically, in MM's case, to China. And some of the components are sourced from Australia. That said, yes, some of their products are still made exclusively in Canada as well.
You can check MM's website and the styles that are 100% Canadian made have a red maple leaf on their listing to signify as much.
Either way, the Manitobah Mukluk website clearly states ""International Production"" on the products that applies to. Nothing tricky or deceptive.

Now, on to the boots. *sigh* '
The design is just my style. Before I first purchased a pair of these many, many years ago, I was so excited for them to arrive that I was showing the pictures of my anticipated purchase to everyone.
No one seemed to think much of them. And some people even said they thought they were ugly.
That is, until they saw these babies on my feet in person!! LoL
Everything about them is great in my opinion. I love that there are no laces or zippers. I just slide my foot in or out of them with no hassles. The structure of the shaft and the leather are sturdy enough that the boots don't slouch excessively. Manitoba Mukluks are the type of boots that look great on skinny legs; at the same time, are wide enough to fit and look even better on big[ger] calves. '
Beautiful quality leather; very thick yet supple. The color is vibrant. The etched detail/design is lovely but not overbearing.
The lining in the shaft is faux fur. The footbed is plush, non-removable, natural shearling and does get worn down but it's a quick and easy fix to order new shearling liners and slip them on top of the existing footbeds when need be. The Vibram soles are the absolute best. Flexible and they move naturally with the movement of your foot. Not restrictive at all. It's like being barefoot without the nuisance of feeling the objects underfoot that would otherwise be sharp or painful if you actually were. Do be advised, though, that if you require arch support, you'll need to purchase accordingly because these are completely flat. Luckily, I don't have any issue of that nature and these are, by far, the warmest and most comfortable shoes I own. So much so, I have 3 pairs in varying colors. ' ' ' And I always have my eye out for new pairs. I'd wear them everyday if I could.
I've worn them in snow in the dead of winter. I've strolled in them in the rain. They have definitely held up in all types of weather. I've heard people say that these, like any inclement weather shoes, should be waterproofed with a silicon--or a similar--all weather spray. But I've never done that. And my feet have never been cold or wet in these boots. Ever. ' To their credit, these boots have held up for years. Soles, leather and all. To this day, I get compliments and stares every time I wear them--which is often. LoL

What else can I say? Oh! Sizing: I have an annoying pair of feet. Narrow, bony, almost always cold...not to mention the killer bunion on my right foot (which, mind you, never hurts when I'm wearing these boots!!! '). I'm somewhere between a size 8 and an 8.5 in most shoes. So I usually purchase an 8.5 to be on the safe side.
The first pair of Manitobah Mukluks I purchased with the Vibram soles was a size 7 since everyone kept emphasizing that these run large and should be ordered down a full size. Even the MM website says that.
Upon arrival, my big toe was so close at the front of each shoe that it was visible to others that they were pushing at the toe of the boots.
However, I kept them because at the time I ordered, there were no size 8s available and I didn't want to wait for them to come back in stock (who knows when that would have been, if ever). Plus, I didn't want to risk them being way more expensive than what I'd paid for the 7s.
Over time, the leather did stretch and the boots fit like a glove now.
That said, the next 2 pairs of MM I ordered are 8s. And those seem to simply have...""softened up"" over time, as opposed to stretching to accommodate my foot. I, personally, wouldn't order these in a 7 again. So, my suggestion: if you're juuuuust over a size or at a half size; don't go a full shoe size down when buying these.

That's all I can think to say about these at the moment. But I'll definitely update if anything else comes to mind. Oh, no; I know. One more thing.

positive,4.0,"After buying different brands of sized 36-inch waist pants, there seemed to be much variation in brand fitment.  I went with the 38-inch waist Haggar because several brands at 36-inch were too tight.  The Haggar seems to be a quality pant, but 38-inch waist seems to be on the large side for my fit, I probably would have liked a 36-inch waist in the Haggar brand.  That said, it seems other reviewers seem to find the length of the crotch to hip on the short side, and with this I tend to agree, making a 38-inch the better choice for my build.  The length of the 34-inch inseam is very generous, I'll probably need them hemmed.  I bought this pant for bowling as they are light weight to help keep me cool, and to meet dress code rules when bowling USBC tournaments.",Haggar quality

positive,4.0,"This seems like a decent quality dress. I was incredibly pleased that this dress has a light liner in the skirt. As for the fit, I am 5'10"" and typically wear a size large because of my height. I ordered the 12 which is the XL on their size chart. It fits me as expected. I don't like the way the waist lays, but I think a cute belt will style that up and help to show off my waist better. The length on me is not too short either, it falls above my knees but not by too much. The collar and the sleeves are cut high. They didn't cut into my neck or arms, however. I believe the tightness will be due to size. Because this is Asian sized I recommend measuring yourself to ensure a proper fit. Also girls with larger chests might struggle with this top even in the largest size because the fabric does not have much give to it. The color is very pretty and matches what it looks like on my computer screen.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.","Nice color, pretty dress"

So far I've hiked about 10 miles in them and I they have been comfortable. I have had a chance to do a little trail running in the time I've had them and these are excellent in that aspect. The shoe runs small so you will probably want to order a size up. I typically wear 10 and a half and this shoe is tight.

Update: I've done a few miles of trail running. These are excellent and quite stable.

I ordered them a size larger than the boys really needed so I'm not certain about their actual fit according to true size but they do fit as I expected them to fit.

positive,5.0,"I use compression shorts to help with a connective tissue disorder--just found them recently, actually, and have tried several different ones.  These provide great compression giving all the joints a little added support, which helps relieve some of the pain.  Although I just received and put it on, the quality in the stitching is obvious and the materials feel just as good as the UA tactical shirt (no giant ""UA"" logo advertising how cool I am) I bought at the same time for $5 more.  Granted, the UA came with prime same day delivery, so I figure part of that cost was eaten up in the speedy delivery.  Nonetheless, I'd say the two shirts are similar quality and would not hesitate to purchase either again.  If anything, the Champion is a little tighter fitting and holds things together a little more snugly.  Having both in the closet is a good thing for me depending on how I am feeling on any given day.  If you know how UA compression shirts feel and want something just a touch tighter for $5 less, here's your answer.  I will probably buy one more of each, just to keep up with the laundry, but would not hesitate to recommend this as a high-quality alternative.  If, over the months, my opinion changes, I will update.  But for now, great shirt, great compression, great price.","Great Shirt, Great Compression, Great Price"
positive,5.0,"My husband is usually between a large or an xlarge in gloves, these fit him quite well in a large. He said that they are warm considering the lightweight material that they are, so he is fine wearing them on hikes or working in the garage in cool weather. But if it was below 32 and/or there was a cold wind, they wouldn't be warm enough for him and he'd switch over to his real winter gloves. These definitely are not wind or waterproof (but they don't claim to be, so we knew that going into it). We got them in the black/bryte yellow because for some reason that color was much cheaper than the other colors - we tend to double check price on the size we need in multiple colors to try to get the best deal on items like this on amazon.

After wearing this for a day outfit 5-6 times, the line between the black cat ears and the nude tights has begun to fray, and the soles and ankles of the feet have begun pilling.

positive,5.0,"I purchased the silver buckle with wings leather Slidebelt and I like it very much.  The buckle and belt are separate and once I determined what size to make it I made the cut in the back and inserted the leather in the appropriate latch and then tried it on for any further adjustments if any - they were not needed.  I like the fact that there are no belt holes and the buckle has a type of ratchet mechanism which makes incremental changes in the size very easy.  Further the ability to have it fit by this adjustment rather than where the pre-placed holes are is very nice.  While these two variables may seem minor they are essentially the two major reasons I purchased the belt.  As my weight fluctuates and pants size fluctuate so will I be able to have a belt that adjusts as well.  The fact that one can easily change buckles and/or leathers are just additional pluses.

There is a small downside in that I used a scissor to cut the leather belt down to size and it didn't cut exactly even the first time and it still has a very minimum angle.  I'm sure that done with an appropriate leather cutting device it would be even.  It isn't enough of an issue to deduct a star.  And finally a question is posed to the reviewer asking ""how the product fits?""  It is kind of rhetorical in that the very nature of the product is a belt that fits.",Great belt at a great price

I wear a size 18/20, for reference. I ordered size 2x and they are perfect.  I also have found them to be very wearable at work without being costumey because it's only a 2-layer crinoline, unlike many of the 5-layer fluffier ones you can buy.

So a perfect pull on set of jeans with the usual pockets. Couldn't be happier. They do have a slightly odd odor but our guess is it's something they used to get the stone washed color. She ran them once through the wash with Downy, & you can barely smell it. Will go away by next wash.",You won't be disappointed.
positive,4.0,"I recently lost some weight and dropped down from a 38 to a 36 waist so I wanted to purchase a pair of pants in my new size.  I am familar with Carharts but have never owned any of their products.  I considered Carharts more of a warm work pants or jacket.  When I saw that these were on sale I thought I would give them a try.  They are very durable, double stitching, the belt loops are wide and the pants are somewhat thick but not winter thick. I work in a professional setting and am allowed to wear casual clothing, something along the lines of casual friday.  I have worn these pants to work and they are a little plain.  They fit me very well.  I could get away without wearing a belt but they are not too tight.  I think I could work in the yard in these pants just fine.  Since they were on sale the price was not bad but still a little high.  I really believe you are paying extra for the name.  I am used to getting a pair of dockers for about $25.  I have not owned them for very long so I can only assume that they will hold up as well as a pair of jeans but look a little bit dressier. It is hard for me to say at this point that I would buy another pair at this price (I bought two pairs at $35 per pair).",Nice and D

They are very cute but I ditched the belt. I thought the price was a little steep. I buy a lot of American Eagle shorts and these were more expensive, which should not be the case.

So it was time for a new pair. These look even better on him and he says they're even more comfortable than his previous pair. They fit perfectly; the side zipper is really handy. He works as a Security guard and really likes Bates. (The old pair was a cheap pair, we decided to go with quality this time.) I like buying online because you can see previous reviews, I'm glad we went with these.

Update: It's been almost a year and my husbands boots still look nice. Very durable. We actually ordered a second pair a few months ago, one for work and one for every day wear. Well worth spending a bit of extra money, instead of constantly spending money on cheap pairs of boots.",Great boots

It may seems thinner then you might expect, but it is extremely warm, and flexible enough to have good movement with little or no restraint. I believe you could easily wear this as an outer layer alone, as it is also very fashionable.",High Quality

Regarding the 2 zippers, I wasn't very convinced, but they look nice! I'm ~15"" calves and the boot opening is just perfect; it's not needed to use the 2nd zipper.

positive,4.0,"Ive only worn these shoes once but they seemed comfortable. The colors are perfect for the summer. I gave them 4 stars only because the material is a little more plastic like then expected and tends rub your feet a little, but that is fixable by adjusting the straps. Otherwise they look great and definitely the right price!",Ive only worn these shoes once but they seemed comfortable. The colors are perfect for the summer
positive,5.0,"Love these! These are my work shoes (I am a nurse), and I wouldn't wear anything else. I get tons of compliments. I started wearing these years ago, after finding that sneakers/running shoes just didn't give my feet the support they need. My feet feel great with them on, and they still feel good after 12 hours. The uppers are breathable, and keep my feet cooler than they ever were with any running shoes. They are a little pricey, but well worth the money!

positive,5.0,"I've purchased the Fruit of the Loom Men's Pocket T Undershirts a few times, and I'll keep buying them as long as they don't change. I'm generally a Jeans and T Shirts kind of person, and I can get away with wearing these as my everyday shirts because of the various colors and the pocket. They don't look like underwear. Above all else, the Fruit of the Loom Men's Pocket T Undershirts are light weight and comfortable! I don't do hot weather very well, and I'm outdoors quite often. The regular T Shirts hanging on the store racks are nice, as are the multi-packs of white cotton T's, but they're just too darn heavy for me. I highly recommend the Fruit of the Loom 4 pack of Men's Pocket Tees.",Nice Fit and Light Weight!

positive,5.0,"This is a beautiful citrus-y, summery scent; very light and youthful. I really love this. It goes on light and bright, and has good staying power. I think as the afternoon wore on it mellowed into a slightly more mature scent, but nothing heavy or overly sexy. It reminds me of the Colors by Benneton scent, but a little brighter.  The bottle is classy and stable, and my one caveat was that it arrived to me from Amazon with a dented box. It was obviously just tossed in a cardboard box where it had room to slide around and get dented. Since perfume is often given as a gift, I thought I would bring that up, since it doesn't look as great for gift-giving as it would if you bought it from a brick-and-mortar store where it would presumably be more carefully handled. Still, a lovely scent and great product. I would wear this and give it as a gift.","Beautiful, young, light scent"

positive,5.0,"I purchased this luggage to take with me on an 18 day luxury cruise to the South Pacific and I must say I am very happy with this buy. Although I did not need the smallest piece, my daughter and I did need to get two luggage sets as we used the two largest pieces from each set and we packed just what we wanted and needed.

This luggage set is very well built. You the buyer need not worry about the ability of the luggage to hold up to the stress of whatever handling it will receive in transit from airport to airport, etc. The look of the luggage is fantastic and the price cannot be beat. It is difficult for me to imagine that I paid less than three hundred dollars for this set as I feel that I should have paid much more for the quality and look of this superior luggage set.

Luggage is a requirement when doing some travel and your luggage will get beat up and will not look new after as little as one trip to and from your destination. It is helpful to have an understanding when purchasing nice luggage that your fantastic looking brand-new luggage doesnt look that way anymore after just one flight. I expected this going in because some of the luggage reviews here listed complaints along that line. This London Fog luggage set has the right color to hide some of the wear and tear it will get being tossed about on your vacation or business trip. It is the quality of the build that is most important. The material is nice and thick as are the zippers that hold everything together. This luggage will stand the test of time and you will be very happy with the way it moves while you are scooting it along the airport terminals. It rolls very smoothly with little effort, and that my friends is the one bonus that you will truly appreciate in transit. Nothing worse than luggage that wears you down while you try to move it and yourself through corridor after corridor at the airports.

London Fog is rugged, glides smoothly along with you while you walk, looks amazing--making you look better (eat your heart out), costs you very little to own, and is easy to find at the baggage claim because you are the only person at the airport that day with luggage that dashing!",The Best of the Best
positive,5.0,"This military style parachute cargo bag is well made. It is made of heavy duty canvas material and the zipper and straps are heavy duty as well, but it is light in weight and will fold up small for storage when not in use. It should stand up to years of abuse without damage.
The size is generous, and can hold more then I figured it would since the sides are flexible.
There are also two small D-Rings located near each end of the zipper for adding a shoulder strap if needed. However no shoulder strap is included, which would have been nice.
Also there is no way to lock the bags. Having a larger zipper pull tab with a hole in it that would have allowed for someone to but a simple padlock between that and one of the D-Rings would have been nice to help secure the contents, but if anyone really wanted this, they would probably just grabbed the bag a ran. So I did not see this as a downside, but some may.
Also you can get this bag in several different colors. If you are not choosy as to the color, check each for price the price. I purchased the tan version for several $$ less than most of the other colors.",Quality Cargo Tote Bag

positive,5.0,"Beautiful shoes. I would give a 4.5 out of 5 stars just because I don't think their sizing is completely true to size. I wear a size 7.5/8 and these size I'm 8 definitely feel more like 7.5. They squeeze ever so slightly around the toes. However, I've only worn them for a day and they will probably stretch out a bit. The memory foam insole is so comfortable! The turquoise is a beautiful color and I love how thin the soles are, visually. I don't mean that they are bad quality, I am just not a fan of ""clonky"" sneakers. I bought these mainly for walking, not hiking or running, so they are perfect for my needs, while looking really cute. And I got them for under $25 so that's a win all-around.",Beautiful Color!

Each rod easily comes off to remove the bracelet you want and you can easily set it back down into the stand. I purchase this product at a discount in return for an honest review. I'm enjoying it and it's working well for my bracelets. The only negative comment I have is it was not packaged very well in the box and the packaging it was holding it was torn.

positive,5.0,"So far so good!  I've never had any type of wallet, and after reading the reviews and as well as noticing the product itself looked very nice and looked of very good quality, I decided to give it a try.  One reason was to get the RFID benefit, due to upcoming travels, I felt I better protect my cards/ID better.
After having received it and using it for the past couple of weeks now I can say it has taken some getting used to.  I""ve always used a tri-fold type mostly throughout my life.
This Money clip type wallet definitely does not hold as much as my old billfolds, but it has allowed me to eliminate the unnecessary cards and crap that I used to carry around for basically no reason, other than ""it might come in handy some day"" reason.  Lame right.  Every man can realte I'm sure, right?
Getting used to it is coming along nicely, and the wallet is loosening up little by little as I use it daily.  The first several days I could barely get the cards back out from the two card slots on either side, but I do have them pretty much to capacity.  The product info indicates that each of the two slots holds up to six cards, which is about right, but like I said they are in there pretty tight, but slots are indeed loosening up as the real genuine leather gets broken in and sat on (in my pocket) and whatnot.
I love the look of the leather and I've already gotten a few compliments on it as well.",Minimalist in a big way!

positive,5.0,"I was browsing Amazon for Christmas presents when I came across these next level T-shirts. During the summer months, I wear a different T-shirt every day. I used to be a guy you see in the gray or tan T-shirt walking down the street. My wife couldn't figure out why my T-shirts were either tan or gray and asked me to loosen up and put some color in my life. I gave it some consideration and I decided maybe it was time for a change. Several years ago I began purchasing T-shirts in various colors. When I saw the rainbow of colors available from Next Level, I decided the royal blue and the Kelly green T-shirts were good colors for me. To date, I've worn a green shirt, I've washed it and still fits. The material has a good feel and it drapes well for my somewhat overweight body. I tree treat clothing items like shorts, T-shirts and pants as commodities and I look for the best value for my dollar. When I purchased the two Next Level T-shirts, they happen to be a good value so I bought them.

I got the 6-12 month size and it fits my daughter at 9 months old perfectly.

positive,4.0,"My sister recommended Mario Badescu Drying Lotion, so I decided to give it a try. One very big positive is the price. In my experience, many skin care products are scams that can cost a fortune. 17.00 is a fair price for this product. The lotion (thought it's not really a lotion) contains salicylic acid and chamomile. Most people probably know that salicylic acid is a very common and inexpensive product used to treat acne, which can also reduce redness. Chamomile is also used to reduce redness, so the formula of combining the two seems like a good idea.

The directions are simple. Apply your usual nighttime moisturizer before applying the drying lotion. Make sure you allow your moisturizer to dry thoroughly before applying the drying lotion. Then, dip a qutip in the bottle of drying lotion, and apply it to problem areas on your face. Make sure to buy extra long qutips because regular qutips barely reach the bottom of the bottle. Once you have used about half of the product, you are going to want an extra long qutip.

Now, how effective is this product? I think it is just as effective as something like Proactiv. The drying lotion is not a miracle by any means. Does it work? Yes, it works to some extent. It works to the extent that salicylic acid has always worked. Will you have dramatically clearer skin overnight? No. Will you have clearer skin after a few days? Yes. But this product is not a miracle or a new formulation that we have never seen before, and this product does not prevent acne. Many of the reviews fail to mention that this product is actually intended for use on whiteheads. I rarely have whiteheads, so I mainly used the drying lotion on your average red pimples. So I can say that the product does work on average pimples to an extent, but it's no better than Proactive, Retin-A, or anything else you might have tried. I tried the drying lotion on a few whiteheads, and, again, it's not a miracle worker. It works as effectively as most other products I have tried.

I will buy this product again for two reasons: the price is fair, and I do not want to pay a dermatologist to prescribe me benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid. The dying lotion is a good product, but it's not a miracle. Set your expectations reasonably, and you should be fine.",Mario Badescu Drying Lotion

These were the perfect choice. The gray/brown combo goes with everything and I like that they don't have a lot of fluffy fur like so many boots I looked at. The fit is shoe-like, not heavy or clunky, but there's still room for heavy wool socks when needed. I can comfortably tuck in regular or skinny jeans too. I was a little nervous about lace-up boots, but the speed laces at the top make them fairly easy to take on and off. **Update: Still loving these boots after two seasons of wear. I get lots of compliments on them! I live where Uggs are the standard fare for everyday winter wear, but these are unique.",The perfect warm winter boots for Wisconsin
positive,5.0,"I ordered this shirt for a ukulele performance at church.  I typically wear an extra large, so that's what I ordered.  The shirt arrived in good order and is well made.

I reccomend this to all.",I can hear the ukulele music from here.

positive,5.0,"This Wacoal bra is my absolute favorite, wear-all-the-time bra.  I purchased this white one as a replacement to my previous exact same bra because I wore it to death (sadly!).  I desperately wish they had my size in the black, so I could replace that one also.  The bra has lightly padded cups, which is nice because they aren't ridiculously cushy, padded, fake things, but give me a layer of comfort and protection, avoid awkward moments, and help my clothes lay smoothly.  Everything fits nicely, with no pokes or ""too tights"", while also holding my chest up where it should be, not where it wants to be after four breastfeeding children.  Wacoal is definitely a brand worth every penny, especially for hard to find larger sizes, and Amazon pricing makes them more affordable than Macy's, the only other place I can find them (in store).  Highly, highly recommend!","My favorite, wear-all-the-time bra!  Keeps things where they should be, not where they try to be."

positive,5.0,"I wore these out of the box for my 2012 JMT hike. Hiked 220 miles (15-18 miles a day) with about 17-30lbs on my back(depending on how much food and water I had in my pack). I never got any metatarsal bruising . Got maybe 3 minor blisters, compared to my companion who wore light Solomon hikers who got dozens of blisters. They dry pretty quick after getting wet, and have a nice wide toe bed to accommodate for foot swelling. They preformed well, so i gave them 5 stars. My only gripe is that they're so ugly. Wish they made the AT Plus in my size (15), it's much handsomer.",Hiked the JMT in.

My only problem was that there was room in the straps, but I planned on cutting them and sewing ribbons at the top for easy removal (this is being used for a burlesque show) so it wasn't a problem at all!

The charms and 1/2 the ""chain"" were in the smaller bag, and then everything was in the larger bag.  I believe this is to keep it from tangling.

positive,4.0,"Hi. It's me again. I consulted with an apparel expert at Adidas, and I told him that I usually wear a jeans size 36 but that I wear medium (32-34) underwear. He suggested I buy the large because it tends to be a bit tight, and he was right. They're comfortable and a good fit, even at a large size.

However, one thing I should point out is that it makes using urinals at public places just a bit more complicated. (Especially when you're wearing jeans.) I had to undo my belt, unzip my zipper, and pull my equipment out. The head had to readjust from being settled in, and some of the stream went to the side. I had to make sure my junk was completely out and pointed the right way before I could get a decent stream. Then, you have to put it back in.

I'm not an athlete by any means, but my recommendation is that you wear these with shorts, so you have more chances to get air up in there. These boxer briefs are very comfortable and do hold your equipment in. However, they'd be just a bit better if they had a fly. That's why I'm only giving it four stars.

I don't take this kind of thing very seriously, but if nothing else the looks alone make this worth having.  A part of me does really respect the symbolism behind this and the history of it, yet another part of me just wears it because I just feel comfortable with it and it's become part of my daily routine.  Since I started wearing it, I have died exactly 0 times.  Clearly it's working.",I bought this and I haven't died yet.  I must be invincible.

Update:  The company owner contacted me to see what he could do to make me happier.  He refunded my original purchase and sent me another set, free.  These new laces work beautifully!

positive,5.0,"This jacket arrived quickly and is seriously comfortable.  It is form-fitting, but not too snug.  It looks great.  Given some of the reviews, I thought it might be a little small, but a large fits me great.  My first impression is highly favorable.  If this thing is durable, Grin&Bear just got themselves a life-long customer.  I'll update my review after I've worn it a round a bit.

Update:  After washing a few times the fabric relaxes a tiny bit.  Still fits extremely nicely and is comfortable.  The cuffs lose elasticity VERY quickly but that's probably my fault for wearing them around my elbows.  Still a 5 star jacket, I'll be buying clothes from this company until I get too fat to wear their stuff.  Their shirts are great too.",Great light jacket

positive,5.0,"There are few things that work perfectly every time, and this device has done a great job with my wet boots and shoes for several years.

The dryer is rated for 36 Watts and circulates warm air by convection, so there no noise and little to wear out. A 30 year warranty!

No on/off switch, but my extension cord has one.

Low, gradual heat, but overnight has always worked for me.

I put my gloves on top of the boots, and they dried pretty well -- there is an attachment for about ten bucks, but I was too cheap to buy it.

I also saw a neat version the might appeal to a DIYer: ""Make your own with PVC pipe and two small light bulbs (not LED or CFL.) Incandescent light bulbs put out most of their energy, over 90% in fact, as heat. They are actually cheap electric heaters that happen to produce a bit of light too. If you want to make the bulbs last longer or reduce the heat output, wire the bulbs in parallel, not series."" If this one didn't work so well, I might give that a go.

I think part of my disappointment was that so many reviewers mentioned how there was no bounce at all when they wore this bra, even for larger chested gals.  I did not find this to be the case at all (maybe they were doing lower impact exercise?), but then again, I found ""no bounce"" to be hard claim to believe in the first place.

Was it all I had hoped it would be?  No.  But did it cut down on at least some bounce compared to the standard ""pull over your head"" sports bra?  Yes.",Good Bra but Expensive

Its made out of a nice soft but crisp cotton and the design has a slight retro appearance. Runs roomy like most resort shirts but not overly so I don't recommend straying far from your usual size. At $18 this is a lot of shirt for the money tho I don't really care for the other designs offered.,I cant fault this.

positive,4.0,"The shirt's color appears close to my monitor representation.  The tag reads 100% cotton, but it feels a tad ""stiff,"" maybe it will soften with a wash.  I expected a more ""fitted"" cut, but the shirt is leaning to boxy, which is fine for my ""senior"" relaxing needs. All in all, I am pleased with my purchase.

positive,4.0,"To be honest, I didn't buy these to use as water shoes. I saw the toe cap and thought they might be an adequate alternative to Keens. I usually wear a 7 1/2 and have Hobbit feet: wide flat feet with short stubby toes. I got these in a size 8. They have no arch support since they are water shoes, but they are extremely comfortable since I have low arches. My toes can spread though they are a bit long for me. My only qualm, which is purely aesthetic, is that I don't really care for the white stitching.","Extremely comfortable, runs a little large"

positive,4.0,"I would say that this is definitely one of the better watch bands that I have purchased. That being said, it still isn't perfect - the clasp feels fairly cheap. In addition, the locking top part of the clasp does not sit flush...slightly annoying, but I've learned to deal with it.

However, the PU material does feel extremely comfortable. After using metal and leather bands in the past, switching to this band has made the watch feel a lot more natural on my wrist.","Comfortable, but clasp needs improvement."
positive,4.0,"These are a great pair of boots for the price. I ordered the gray leather look boots in a size 8.5, which is my normal size although sometimes it fluctuates with different brands. Upon opening the box I was impressed that these have a really nice color and texture to them, they look like they were more expensive boots. They fit my feet pretty well, and should be decently comfortable to wear. They felt a little narrow at the toe but I have kinda wide feet so that wasn't surprising. They might be uncomfortable for long periods of wear but I probably won't find out until fall/winter (it's 110 degrees where I live right now). I also have short legs so the boots come all the way up to my knee, the calf area is a tad wide but overall they fit pretty well considering I ordered them online. They look cute with my skinny jeans and I will definitely be wearing them come winter. The pictures that other people have uploaded are very accurate to how they look on me, they hit right below the knee and have a nice slouchy look.

Other people mentioned that they were really thin, but I didn't really notice that. I mean, ordering boots online for less than $50 what do you really expect? These are not heavy duty boots, they are just cute and fashionable. I always wear thick socks under my boots in the winter to keep my feet warm, as these boots are not lined heavily enough for warmth. Overall I am very happy with these boots, I like the style and the color, and the material is nice. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I still paid for the product and will wear them, I just received a promotional price in order to review them.",These are a great pair of boots for the price

positive,5.0,"For this price point, you cannot go wrong.  I needed a simple analog watch for everyday wear but with my new job needing me to dress a little more professionally than I have had to in the past I thought that I would go for a watch with a more fashionable look to it.  After looking at all the Fossil and Citizen watches that met what I was looking for I noticed this Timex.  It had the same look to it, but was a heck of a lot less expensive so I figured that I would give it a try.

I was really impressed when it arrived, as it has very sleek styling and the satin metallic black finish looks just as fancy as the watches going for upwards of $200.  My wife has mentioned on several occasions that it looks great and we even stopped at the watch counter in Macy's to compare it to the more expensive watches, and it fits right in with them easily.

At first I thought that there was something wrong with the date marker as it didn't move ahead after midnight, but then after playing with it I realized that I needed for ""forward"" the watch through a full 24 hour cycle so that it would ""catch"" on the date dial moving the number up at midnight.  Once I did that, it has worked like a champ for two months now without a problem.",Just as fancy as the fancy-pants watches!
positive,5.0,"This jacket looks amazing, is waterproof, and works great in the winter. It's a LITTLE heavy. I'd recommend it for temperatures between 35 - 60 Fahrenheit. I must say, it's not the most comfortable jacket ever. I guess I was expecting a little 'softer'.",Really good looking jacket

I was looking for something I can carry a small notebook, iPad, phone and kindle with some pens, chargers, headphones and a small bag with feminine products, lipstick, IB, powder and a small travel brush. All these items fit but I can't zip it up. My sunglasses case made it difficult to get in so I had to just keep them in the car which is disappointing since I usually need them when I am also not in the car.

But unfortunately Olga discontinued my favorite one and I hated the look of the available ones and ordering another brand only ended in disappointment for me. So, I decided to stick with Olga and just order something other than a minimizer. I picked this specific bra based solely on reviews and also because it wasn't ugly. Much to my surprise (and delight) it fit perfectly! I even tried it on with a few button up shirts (which can be a real issue for us girls with a bigger chest) and there was no gaping and everything looked not only great but even better than it did with my old minimizers. I think I'll still look for a minimizer to have on hand for certain occasion, but now I'm not in a rush to find one. I'm very pleased with this purchase. The lift is great and without padding even!

My husband is a huge Batman fan and is all the time telling me ""I'm Batman"". While he may never wear this shirt out of the house I just know he will get a kick out of it. He is all the time telling me how he needs more shirts so for the past several years I have been purchasing different shirts for him.

This shirt seems to be made up of well made quality materials; cotton. You can tell from holding it up that it is a thicker cotton and that it is well made. As of now I have mark the 'fit as expected' because for now without washing it, that is how it fits. If this changes or if it shrinks or anything happens once I wash it then I will update this review.  This shirt comes in many different color choices.  I went with my husband's favorite color - green.

positive,5.0,"I've literally searched for years for the perfect shoe and I think I've found it.  I have a problem where when the back of the shoe is too high it rubs against my achilles.  I've searched all over for a mary jane that was stylish, yet goes with any outfit, and I had an extremely difficult time finding anything that met that criteria, let alone anything comfortable that didn't rub my achilles raw.  I went into a Takken's shoe store on a whim one day thinking if I have to get a shoe that's comfortable I guess I'll just have to settle for some ugly walking shoe.  I went in and the first shoe I noticed was this Dansko Tacey XP style.  I thought ""its too cute to be comfortable"".  I was totally wrong.  The back of the shoe is just short enough not to rub on me, but not so short that it completely slips off my foot.  The Dansko shoes are designed to slip a little in the back and provide a roomy box for the toes.  At first I didn't think a shoe that slips so much would be comfortable, but I've been walking around in them for 2 days and have not had any rubbing, nor has the shoe slipped completely off.  I also find that i haven't been clenching my toes in order to keep the shoe on, so my feet feel extremely relaxed.  The XP padding is really comfortable and offers a lot of arch support.  Apparently I have pretty high arches, so these  are just what I need.  I was told that nurses buy these shoes and now I see why.  You could literally walk around in them for 12 hours, get home and not want to take them off.  I highly recommend them.  And the best part is that I can wear them with a nice dress or in jeans and they still look great :)  I probably won't need another pair of shoes for at least the next five years!  the price is up there, but its totally worth it if I don't have to go shoe shopping ever again for the next half decade, especially with my stringent criteria for a proper shoe.",The most comfortable mary jane I've ever worn.

positive,5.0,"I am age 62, 5'7-1/2"", and weigh 148 but feel young as a spring chicken in NYDJ slim leg jeans.  Actually I feel like a million bucks when I put these jeans on. After previously buying a couple of pairs in various styles in size 12 (which is what I thought I was), I have finally found the perfect fit in size 10 NYDJ slim leg jeans.  They are snug when you first put them on, but after about a half hour or so, they loosen up and mold to my body shape.  They are oh so great when paired with a tunic top, or a tank under a nice blouse. Do not make the mistake of buying them too big like I first did. Once you find your true size in NYDJ, you will discover that these are the best fitting jeans you ever had. I prefer the slim leg myself. I bought them in black and am very happy with the material - not too thin and not too thick.  Turn them inside out when you wash them and use cold or warm water - not hot, and they will stay dark black longer.",Found Nirvana

He has skied and played in the snow with them and they kept in dry and warm. The only con to them we have experienced so far is that there was no loop or belt loops to attach a ski lift ticket to.

The closest to red I would classify is oxblood and that's still too red for this color.

On the bright side it does have tons of pockets and as long as the color doesn't bleed on the inside o my bag if damp, I will be completely satisfied.

The lining does help keep them warm and block much of the wind from reaching your legs. Being FR and lined I would say they are not too bad on the price. I will probably order more next time I have to work in a colder climate on a FR job. The lining is not very thick, so if you are somewhere very windy or on the extreme end of the cold spectrum, you may need another layer.","Good pants, though long."

positive,5.0,"We read the reviews about the slimmer fit, so we originally ordered the small. It was too big, so we returned it and ordered this one (XS).
It is true-to-size US men's XS, on the slimmer fit side. My 24 year old son wears men's extra small in several brands, he has a 36 inch chest, is about 5'5"", and weighs about 123 lbs. He fits well in the American Apparel style slimmer fit XS, but the Gap's traditional style looser fit men's XS is loose on him. If you want a looser fit, order the small.
The coat is long. He is 5'5""-5'6"" or so, and the XS's zipper starts just above his knees. The men's small is longer, and on him, the zipper started at his knees- a little too long.
The coat quality is good- it is fully lined, and the seams are sturdy. This coat is a heavy cotton- kind of a twill, but smooth and a true black. I think the coat will hold up for many years. The collar folds down or stands up with extra height- zipping all the way up -it's a nice fierce look. We are very happy with the coat.

positive,5.0,"Really nice rash guard.  I ordered an XXL, and its a good fit - not skin tight, but a bit loose (I'm 5'8"" and about 220lbs).  I wanted some sun protection for a long horseback ride in the hot sun on the beach, and I was afraid it would be too hot, but I could feel the wind blowing through it and I didn't feel overheated.  The material is a nice thickness - not cheap feeling.  Its a good length too.  If pulled tight straight down, would reach to my hips.  Wearing it normally with a bit of a bunch to the material still left a nice length, with no gaping at the waistband if you bent over.  Can't beat the cute color inserts either.  :)",Love it - good purchase!

positive,5.0,"I love these so much!!!!!  They just came in and i admit i was a tad skeptical but they were perfect!!!  Ive seen tons of sizing questions on here so ill add my sizes to better help other ladies choose theirs.  Im 5ft 10in, 157 lbs , size 6-7 wemons pants, 13-14 pants in juniors....i purchased the medium set and they fit perfectly i feel i probably could have even purchased a small and been fine as the fabric is forgiving... Im also a mom and have some excess skin problems from my baby belly and thats why i purchased these panties.... I can honestly say that these panties are definitely great shapeware/gurtle panties for the price... For the first time in 13 years i can wear a snug dress and feel confident about my body!!!!  I know it sounds silly but these undies just made my day ! Ladies these are a great buy!!!!!

Update ,its been almost two weeks since i purchased these and they really do slim me down quite a bit and i still love them the only issue i have had is a rather strange one... I headed the warning of another review and washed all of these garments twice by themselves before wearing them and all was well until i finally wore the black pair ...its rather embarrassing but they dyed my skin black even after i washed them 2 times , its really common with certain black dyes but i just wasn't expecting that lol so i highly recommend washing the black pair alone in hot water with either a harsh detergent or a little bit of bleach just to rid the garment of any exess dyes... All and all even with my discoloration i still stand behind my earlier statements, they really are pretty nifty",Im loving these undies!!!!!  Great buy!!!!

positive,5.0,"This is the pretties package I have received in a long time! I felt so fancy opening up the organza purple bag. Inside the bag was the cutest ring box, black with gold polka dots, and a gold card insert. One side of the insert says: The Circle. Infinity. Life. Love. The other side is a ring symbolism quick guide, telling you the meanings of what finger you choose to wear your ring on.

I love all these adorable extras, it really makes me feel like SPUNKYsoul cares about us girlie girls. It was definitely a great experience opening this ring and would be a perfect treat to give as a gift. Whomever the recipient of this ring would feel special and pampered with all the extra touches added to the packaging.

The ring itself is dainty and feminine. The twist gives it the right amount of interest to keep it classy and simple. I've been wearing it all week with no skin issues whatsoever. It's light and comfortable. My fingers have the tendency swell in my sleep so I usually take off any rings I am wearing so they are not tight on my finger in the morning. I've forgotten to take off this ring at bedtime and woken up the next day to it being as comfy as the night before.

I would recommend this ring and company SPUNKYsoul, the ring makes a great gift for someone special or for yourself!  The packaging is unique and delightful to open and the ring is dainty and classic.

positive,5.0,"Running in these shoes isn't exactly like running barefoot; it's better.  It's like running in soft, practically weightless slippers.  Although I mainly use these on roads and treadmills (flat surfaces), on rocky terrain there is still adequate protection.  Averaging about 40 miles per week, I anticipate getting at least six months of use out of these shoes, but I wouldn't be surprised if they lasted much, much longer because the construction and materials seem so solid.

For my first pair of true ""barefoot"" shoes, I couldn't be happier.  Only minor soreness accompanied my first few runs, but now my feet feel stronger than ever.  Literally, I can feel how muscular my feet have become--in a good way.

positive,4.0,"I like these thigh bands because I love to wear dresses when it's hot, but I don't want to wear panty-hose or leggings under my dress. These thigh bands have silicone grips on the inside to keep them in place on your legs. My only complaint is that on the back of the leg they roll down a little bit, but it's not that noticeable. Also I can't wear them with light colored knit dresses, because the fabric material kind of shows through - the fabric of my dress kind of catches on the fabric of the thigh bands, so my dress doesn't flow smoothly.  I guess the smooth fabric (non-lace) ones would be fine with my knit dresses, but I only have the lace ones.

I do not use the pads that come with the underwear even though there is nothing wrong with them. I use my larger heavier silicone pads that fit perfectly. I am posting pictures below. The first picture has the underwear with the padding that comes with them. The next picture is with my silicone pads and the last picture is the silicone pads next to the pads that come with the underwear. These underwear are extremely comfortable.

 Fit is OK but Im not sure how you would go at the larger ends of the scale. Not real thick but they are not designed to be and come in a really small box which makes you wonder how they can get six sets of socks in there until you see how small they are.

 They stretch OK but are less stretchy than regular socks in my opinion which means you have to put them on the right way otherwise they won't fit. Still, they fit so little to complain about - Ill update if any issues after a wash.

She normally wears a 2 in most sneakers right now so I decided to go a size up, in case they ran small, and also to maybe get a few years out of them. I do think they are true to size and she does have extra room in the toes, which is fine, and she seems to like them and says they are comfortable.

positive,4.0,"Soft Style Alesia gets 4 stars even though I'm returning it, because the style is so cute- pointed but not-too-pointy, with a kitten heel, this is a classic, vintage looking shoe. The construction is decent, especially for the price. The size (I'm a WW, difficult to fit) was exactly right, and though there was something strange about the toe bed shape for my particular foot, these would be pretty comfortable. But the ""nude cloud patent"" color is hideous. It looks so much more pearl in the photos, in person it is super shiny peach. Perhaps for a person with a light peaches-and-cream skin tone this would work, but not for my olive tone. These are going back, but I would order this brand again, and specifically consider this very shoe in a different color.","Cute vintage style, ugly color"

Because I have very high arches, the foot bed doesn't quite work for me; however, this is a pretty common problem so I don't dock any points there. Otherwise, these shoes seem quite comfortable. I am a true size 7, and while these shoes fit I am normally used to a bit more room in the back. Not too small, but if you are between sizes, I would opt for a half size up. Also to note are that the back and side straps. These are Velcro closures. I was not expecting this, but it makes for an easy adjustment and for slipping the shoes off. Finally, I will mention the color. I bought the red. However, when I received them, they are more of a deep coral, with a tinge of orange. I actually like the color better than the picture, but please be aware that the red is not a true stop sign red.

I got them for my daughter to use for stage makeup (she has been doing character makeup for a small Shakespeare troupe in our county). It works amazingly!

This high-coverage liquid foundation is smooth, easy to apply and gives complete coverage with just a very, very tiny amount. It dispenses from a tube and gives a nice satiney finish. It has an almost undetectable fragrance, and produces no irritation on my very sensitive skin. Truly excellent product.",Excellent product

But, these shoes have good support (for mild over pronation) without having too rigid of a forefoot.  Despite the heel to toe drop, I naturally mid-foot strike in them.

I was just speaking with someone the other day who was wearing a pair when these arrived.  They're not overly large but just right.  I especially like the extra detail of the decorative rib on either side of the ball.  The ball is free to spin and catches the light in a pleasant way.

positive,5.0,"I don't know where this review will end up seeing as so many of these hats have slightly different pictures or sellers with varying prices, but trust the picture of the hot Japanese lady wearing the hat(brown hair, orange shirt). Gotta admit, it looks exactly as you will expect it, like the picture but rolled up tightly in a bag. Mine was shipped basically wrapped in a plastic sheet(not a real bag), then put inside a cheap gray plastic bag(sealed), and finally in another gray bag with shipping labels. Not too bad seeing as it was a cheap price and amazingly well made. It's a lot like the 2 years later Law Hat in that its not a regular hat but something you kind of put on your head and then pull down till it stays on. It might slip of for people with larger heads, if you walk a lot in it. Still it is incredibly nice.
This is one of the good instances were the picture does not lie, if you are looking at the right picture. I still prefer my pre time-skip chopper hat over this one since that one was bigger, but having them side by side is too cool!",Too many sellers! Too many Variations!

positive,5.0,"Love them.  I was looking for a very small earring since I rarely take them out. I have had other small hoop earrings but I especially like these because they are a bit wider and you can actually see them as opposed to a very thin wire. Not gonna lie, they are difficult to get in. It's not something you would want to do on a daily basis, but if you are like me and keep your earrings in for an extended period, I would recommend these.",Very nice and simple
positive,5.0,"I love these work pants.  They fit as expected.  They are a good mid-weight - not too heavy or rigid, but still tough and good for year round wear.  Pretty darn durable as well.  I bought my first pair of these on Amazon a little over a year ago.  I wear them quite frequently for work, and they have held up great. Dickies are usually a great value, but I have had issues in the past finding the right size with some Dickies styles -which is incidentally my biggest complaint about Dickies, overall.  There seems to be no consistency from style to style (or even sometimes with differing colors of the same style) regarding sizing and fit for Dickies pants.  The styles of Dickies that Walmart carries seem to run about a size and a half too small.  I typically wear 34x30, and I couldn't button the Wal-Mart Dickies in that size with a pair of vice grips.  However, the 36x30 in the same style are way too baggy for me.  I also had the same problem with the first pair of Dickies I tried from Amazon - https://smile.amazon.com/Dickies-Mens-Relaxed-Duck-34x30/dp/B000PSVEUW/ref=sr_1_1?s=apparel&ie=UTF8&qid=1490228952&sr=1-1&nodeID=7147441011&psd=1&keywords=Dickies%2BMen's%2BRelaxed%2BFit%2BDuck%2BJean%2C%2BMoss%2C%2B34x30&th=1&psc=1.  Luckily, I found these that actually do fit, and I have been extremely pleased.","Very Comfortable, Great value, Glad I found a Style of Dickies that Actually Fits Correctly"

Your feet are going to sweat, even on cooler days. I've worn them in 50 degree F weather, and on days when the factory is 90 F on the inside (I live in MI, weather has mood swings like a teenager).

In the photo, it looks large and bulky, but in person it is a fine detailed necklace that looks very pretty. The sterling silver links on the chain are small and shine next to the ultra shiny gemstones. The 18 inch chain size is a nice size, for a small neck, but the 20 inch would hang lower. This necklace arrived in a hinged box that slid out of another jewelry box. Overall, this necklace is very nice!",Very Pretty!
positive,5.0,I owned an eco-drive watch a few years ago  and it was either lost or stolen. I suppose I will never know which. This is a very attractive watch.

positive,4.0,"Wonderful price; great quality.  I'm not a big fan of the plastic forefoot sole- I think it is supposed to resemble the old leather soles.  Love the laces and leather grain.  The actual color is lighter than the picture shoes, unless you neutral polish them every day.  For the price and quality, I will probably get a black pair as well.  The foot support is the best that I've had (no flat footbed here) outside a hiking boot.  For those of you who don't like things hitting high-ankle, this shoe is not for you though; it has little to no cushioning there to lessen the contact.",Probably Purchase a Black Pair Too

To be honest, Ive always wanted a blazer and as  this being my first one ever, Im really impressed and am absolutely in love with! Its really cute and fashionable and looks good casually with jeans or classy with dress pants or a skirt. This also makes a cute transition piece for warmer to colder seasons, as the material is lightweight. This is something particularly important to me because I get really uncomfortable in heavier clothes. The shoulders aren't too small or too large, but fit me just right.

They were pretty roomy at the top, like they were made for a more buxome foot. I have a pretty high arch, and they gave great arch support.  The only thing I really wasn't crazy about was that the criss-cross straps just seemed like they were too long, and didn't fit snugly against my foot, if that makes any sense.

I like the splash of gold, too.  Since it is 3 sided, as it turns on the bracelet, you can always see the face of the bead.

It is large enough to make a statement, when placed in the middle, but small enough to use as a spacer bead anywhere on the bracelet or necklace.

I wouldn't give it much for educational value, but that's not the point, the point is the kid can put it on his face and immerse himself for however long in 'being' Spidey!!  That's what it was all about when I was a kid and we'd get a cloth mask and a broomstick and Dad's hat and spend hours as The Lone Ranger! What Fun!

I want the true barefoot experience in my shoes, and the Vapor Glove is the only Merrell that fits that definition for me right now.  However, I'm having some problems with one knee, and the physical therapist urged me to get a shoe with more structure and arch support.  I'm happy to say that this shoe pleases the p.t. without compromising too much on comfort.  A stack height between this shoe and the Vapor Glove would be fantastic, but after trying lots of shoes this one seems to be the least bothersome, and the heel rise is doable.  The arch isn't even too intrusive, and the padding on the heel and tongue is okay, comfy without pushing my foot in odd directions.

That said, I love the looks of this shoe!  I have the Blue Depths, and the combination of greens and blues, with a touch of hot pink is perfect.  Nothing boring here!  I still think barefoot is healthier for your feet, but if you want or need a little more padding and arch, this shoe is for you.  I'm giving it four stars instead of five for my own quirky reasons - I just want less shoe.",Attractive shoe with a few compromises.

positive,4.0,"Quality is great, pads are a little awkward. I removed mine and it was just as great.

positive,5.0,"The shoes fit perfectly!
I am a first time buyer to this brand. Comfortable just like putting my feet into patted or cushion like sneakers.
Usually in the store you can look on the in side of a shoe and see the size. So normally I would see the half sizes printed 9 1/2 for my size.
But on line the sizes for me are 9.5 D(M) US and that was a good guess on my part. Maybe the sellers can explain what the M,D and E stand for, because it clears the doubt for those aren't familiar with these letters. Which might bring in a lot more sales with people having to know rather than not be sure.",This brand has gotten my attention

positive,4.0,"For the price, these are good sunglasses.
But you ultimately do get what you paid for.
The glasses, the case, the microfiber cloth, all have a very chemical, rubber smell that is a bit off putting. I expected it to go away after a day or so, but I've had the glasses for well over a month now and I still smell it.

The case the glasses come in has a carabiner, so I hooked them to my backpack. After a month or so, the stitching on the glasses case is starting to rip.

The sunglasses squeak when I open the legs. Not a big deal, but noticeable.

All these things aside, for the 10 or so dollars I paid for them, I'm happy with the purchase. They serve their purpose.","Not Bad for the Price. Some Issues, Though"

After poring over reviews of many other brands I'd never heard of and LOOKING AT PICTURES ONLINE ELSEWHERE OF TARGUS THAT IS well-known and had zippers that looked CHEAP AS HECK, went a bit more expensive and got this Samsonite. Its wonderful. Spins like a dream push/pull, I'm 5'6"" and the very tall handle is actually very comfortable. Fits my MacBook Pro 15.5"", cords, notebooks, files of folders pretty well but still has a limit. Rolls great. Only got it a couple weeks ago so don't know how it will hold up but the zippers and fabric right off appear heavy-duty as opposed to Targus and other brands reviewed here so spring for this one. I'm a lady and don't think I could fit ANY clothes plus laptop in this-that's laughable to me, I'd use a full-size carry-on to bring even one extra suit if I went for a business day trip- I only use this back/forth to office/home on daily basis. Wrap your purse strap around the handle, set it on top, and your shoulders are carry-free, wheel away - love it! Only giving 4 instead of 5 due to bit of limited room capacity inside, but if any bigger I suppose it wouldn't fit well underseats on planes but haven't had opportunity to use it for air travel yet.

positive,5.0,"My little man looked top notch for sister's wedding. Great setup and QUALITY material is expected. I like suits of this nature. Big question of the day, who pays ring bearer tux cost? Parents or groom and bride?If the child is young, or the ceremony is long, the child may take a seat with parents after he/she has given the rings to both the bride and the groom make sure the outfit matches. After the ceremony, the child may be more comfortable if he/she is able to change into other clothing.  Children do not stand in a receiving line, is another form of wedding etiquette, I know the suspense, whos going to pay the cost of tux?
On the day of the wedding, the ring bearer will walk down the aisle after the bridesmaids and either before the flower girl or with her.  He/she will carry a pillow that has either the bride and grooms rings attached to it, or plastic rings attached.
Depending on the clothing the bride chooses for the ring bearer to wear, the ring bearers parents may be asked to purchase or rent the clothing.  The bride and groom should decide who will pay for the cost of the clothing before the child is asked to participate in the wedding, so there are no misunderstandings.  Generally, the parents pay the costs.

positive,5.0,"I bought two of the same light pink -- one for me, one for my sister -- and we love them so much! The weight is perfect and they're beautifully crafted, just the right size, and the cord is terrific since we can adjust the length to match any outfit. Lovely color. They're dressy enough for church and casual enough for running errands. I've received many compliments. The symbology of each element (the simulated leather cords, the wire, the nails) make these crosses even more meaningful. Too, this seller thoughtfully included care instructions and an email address for comments or problems.

I should point out (since I was confused) the horseshoe crosses that sell for .01 are from a different seller named ""Horseshoe Crosses."" The crosses are smaller and while I can't tell if they won't last as well as the ChanCrafted crosses I'm reviewing here until I wear them more (I bought two later on, thinking they were made by the same folks), the ones made by Jamie of ChanCrafted Artisan Jewelry [...] are my favorites. They're larger (perfectly sized), well crafted, and the wire coverage is obviously better. Very fast delivery for both. Mind, I'm not saying the ones made by Horseshoe Crosses are in any way shoddy, but I just don't see how they can make a profit at a penny a piece without cutting corners somewhere. According to the ChanCrafted insert, the shipping charge pays for the shipping, the supplies to make the crosses, and the Amazon fees. The $4.99 is the cost of the time it takes to make them and Jamie's expertise. Well worth the modest price, IMHO. At any rate, five stars for these crosses!","Thank you, Jamie!"

positive,5.0,"I was looking for a comfortable short for camping and outdoor activities. So far these are great! I was pleasantly surprised because it can be risky ordering shorts online because fit can be challenging for all body types. The material of these is nice and breathable. I typically wear a size 10 and went with a Large since I like my shorts on the loose side. These are the exact fit I like; not too short and not too long (they hit just shy of my fingertips and I'm 5'6). The legs openings are nice and wide and not binding. The fit is flattering especially to my thighs. I ordered the purple color and am very pleased. I plan to order another pair. I haven't gotten to test them out in water so I can't attest to their drying abilities yet, but so far I have no complaints!  I'd say ordering your true size will be just fine, but if you like them loose in the legs and thighs go up a size!",Finally found a comfortable outdoor short that is also flattering

positive,5.0,"These leggings are so warm and comfortable! They don't slid down in the crotch like some tights do. They are thick like pants but flexable. I live in New England where it can be very cold and I think they will keep me warm out doors just fine.

positive,5.0,"I'm not skinny and these won't just make me thin,but it's a nice level of compression. It is not uncomfortable in any way, but I can always feel it, so it's great for correcting a lazy slouched stance/gate. Don't get me wrong, it's not uncomfortable when I do ""relax"" a little, but it obviously gets way tighter which reminds me. I wear X/XXL depending on style and cut of shirt. Most T's are fine in an X, nicer stuff usually XX. Bought the XL size. Haven't had to wear a suit in over a year so I don't have my actual chest measurements on hand. I know that would help more sorry. 40 waist. Probably around 46in chest.",Great for posture
positive,5.0,"I love the fit of these shoes, not tight at all and I can wear thick socks. On the box they say ""Relaxed fit"" so not a wide shoe but ample space for good socks.

This amazing purse fits all of my stuff and does it in a way that is compact and doesn't scream ""I can fit most of my house in here!""
On a side note, the faux leather (or possible unicorn skin) has that buttery, real-leather feel to it and looks very classy. I may order another color just to have options. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PURSE!

positive,5.0,"Love these for ultra-light packing! I purchased two of these after trying many other packing cubes of similar size, include smaller eBags. At first glance these seem tiny, and the fabric extremely thin. However when I stuffed them completely full, I was amazed at how much they hold! In just one of these small bags, I was able to fit a sports bra, 3 pairs of wool hiking socks, and 6 pairs of underwear. You can actually use them as a stuff sack, if you zip up the one size and place them on end. When stuffed completely full, I was still worried that the fabric or the seams would rip, since it is so thin. However after poking and prodding and stuffing them into my backpack in many ways, I'm convinced that they'll hold up. Also, the zipper seems well made and zips very smoothly. I will be purchasing the larger ones as well, since they add virtually no weight to my bag!",Love these for ultra-light packing

positive,4.0,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my boyfriend & he likes his shirts a little bit larger than what his actual shirt size. I don't know how they decide how small or large to cut the fabric for the shirts but I'm assuming they cut them a little smaller than say for example... Faded Glory cuts their shirts for guys. Plus there is the fact these shirts are 100% cotton so of course I bought a large (originally), since he normally wears a medium. That one ended up fitting him a little more snuggly than he would have liked so we tried again. Hence the is review for the 3XL... It's long enough but it is too wide (he doesn't have a weight problem like me). It's a great product that is avaiable in different beautiful colors. It is perfect for Attack On Titan fans!

positive,5.0,"I don't remember chinos being a men's staple when Dockers released it's first.  Back then, Dockers wasn't owned by Levi's and their biggest competition was probably Bugle Boy.  Their first chino was casual and rugged, as chinos were meant to be, since they originated for military wear.

At some point over the next few years, as chinos grew in popularity and Levi's purchased Dockers, they began making them more dressy and with lighter fabrics.  The chino went from a rugged pant that was a step up from jeans, to a super casual option for business.  They went from a pant mostly worn by younger men, to a pant mostly worn by older men.

Why am I telling you this?  Because the Dockers Alpha pant is more like the original Dockers chino, that was more rugged and casual than what we now associate with the chino pant.  The Dockers Signature is the culmination of what the chino has become - i.e. lighter biz-casual pants made for older men, who may want to iron a crease down the middle of the leg.  In contrast, the Dockers Alpha is the pant you want to wear with boots, while foraging through the forest or anything that requires outdoor activity.

Nothing against biz-casual wear, but the dressy chino is just so mundane.  I love the Dockers Alpha and I find it shameful that the clothing industry has, for the most part, turned the chino into a dressy pant.  Hopefully Dockers will continue making the Alpha forever and offer new fits when necessary.  I've always preferred rugged chinos and always will, so while I might change my preference on the fit, it's unlikely that I'll ever prefer a more dressy chino.",The Real Chino

positive,4.0,"This headband is a show stopper.  It is huge and cumbersome but adorable, nonetheless.  Baby wore it for a few photo shoots but on our first day out, she tore it apart within minutes.  The heavy sequin bow is hot glued to the feathers which is glued to felt and glued to the headband. I bought this headband intending to remove the feathers and reattach the bow because it is a gorgeous bow but loved the look of it as a whole once it arrived and kept intact (until baby pulled it apart, of course). I did eventually salvage and reconfigure the bow and headband.  I recommend this product for purposes of photo shoots but not for a day out.

positive,4.0,"I bought this to wear in Vegas for halloween.  I love the way this costume looks, but there was a fixable fit issue.  The costume is cute, it fits well through the bodice and the skirt hits right below my butt so that my entire butt is covered (although I did buy a short petticoat to wear under the skirt for some extra fit and coverage).  I have a longer torso and had tried on some other Halloween costumes that didn't cover my butt at all.  This one at least covers it, but I certainly won't be bending over in this out in public.  The main fit issue that I had was that there was way too much material in the bust.  I am a 34 C and I felt like my boobs were lost in all the extra fabric.  For a quick fix day of Halloween I pulled down and tucked the extra white fabric into the top of the black bodice piece and pinned it into place.  I eventually would like to sew it in, but haven't gotten around to it yet.  My only other problem with the costume is that it arrived extremely wrinkled.  Both the cape and the skirt were extremely wrinkled and both say that they can't be ironed.  I tried ironing the costume through another piece of fabric and it just barely helped.  I wish there was another way to iron the costume.  Other than those two minor issues, I'm still pretty happy with the overall look of the costume.","Love the Look, Had to Adjust the Fit"

positive,4.0,"At 5'9"", this hoodie in medium fits me like it does on the model in the picture.  I purchased other Alternative items though and the fits were all different.  Thinner Alternative hoodies required me to size down to avoid a pajama-loose hoodie. This one though is true-to-size.  With more color choices than the norm and a fair amount of sales here--I caught it for $22 and think that's justified given the current options from comparable (fitted) brands--it can hit a good price/benefit point as a fitted casual hoodie that you won't make you look like you wandered out of a college dorm if you wear it out of the house.

Wouldn't expect this to last as your go-to hoodie and would also suggest sizing up if you're looking to this for a Rainy-Sunday-Couch-Hoodie, but it's solid enough for the (sale) price.",Solid hoodie with fair sweatshirt-weight material.

positive,5.0,"Ordered black 71/2. I have been looking for $20 pair of black shoes and I found these wedges. I used to have the Madden Girl Ursey wedges and I loved them so I wore them a lot and they finally ripped after so much wear and tear. Anyways, I was delighted to find these b/c they look similar. Besides the patent material, these have a little bit of an almond toe, but it's a wider than normal almond toe. I have semi flat feet and I have used them for all day work wear and they have been comfortable. I also have a long second toe and they don't bother me. The shoes may not work for you if you have wide feet unless you don't care about having the side bulge. I have it a little bit but it might just be me and it's prob not noticeable to other people. I also find that the shoe covers my toes completely. I just have a tiny bit of pinky and 4th toe cleavage and then the rest are covered. I think the Madden Girl shoes had more toe cleavage. These have now been moved into my regular shoe rotation. I like simple black pumps that I can wear with anything and these wedges are that.

positive,5.0,"I can't say enough about how useful a shemagh can be in hotter climates.  I keep at least one of these handy in my camping/survival gear for many reasons:

- Keeps you cool when it is wet, either worn just around the neck or wrapped around your head
- Makes a great arm sling
- Can be used as a camp towel or wash rag
- Could be used as a tourniquet in an emergency
- Makes a great bandage wrap for a big wound
- Keeps the sun off your head/neck
- Can be used to pre-filter mucky water that you need to prep for drinking
- Partial head/neck camouflage
- Protects my neck during paintball play while keeping me cool

I keep finding more and more uses for this shemagh.  I now own 4 different colors.  They are easy to wash, and you just let them air dry.  Instructions say to machine wash cold on a delicate cycle or hand wash, and air dry only.  Wring it out, let it air dry for less than a half hour fully opened up, and it's dry and clean.",So many uses!

These earrings are really nice looking. They can be worn with casual or dress clothes. They are an off white creamy color and they look nice with everything. The earrings come in separate sealed plastic baggies to keep them from rubbing against each other and maybe getting scratched. They are in a nice box and also come with a soft drawstring bag and a polishing cloth. This is a very nice pair of pearl earrings that would also make a great gift.

positive,5.0,"I was looking for a nice classic leather belt that will wear well with jeans and other casual pants. I stumbled across this one, and went ahead and ordered a large (I'm a size 6/8). The leather has held up very well, and it does not seem as prone to bending in the back middle as some of my previous belts (bonded leather) have done in the past. It fits very comfortably, and keeps me from constantly tugging my jeans up, as they start to slide down my hips after I've worn them for a bit.

This belt looks very smart with a pair of black jeans and a sweater. I love that I can transition a jeans belt to slacks and have it adapt to the outfit. It doesn't draw a lot of attention, but that wasn't what I was looking for in this belt. The price is only slightly more than the cheap belts that they sell in many stores, but I can tell that it is made out of leather and not the bonded crud that starts to crack and fall apart after a few wears. I will say that this belt has made me keen to try other belts from this brand and I would highly recommend this.

As an Amazon customer, I know how annoying and difficult it is when reviewers cant be trusted. So, I would like to say that whenever I provide any reviews I always take my time and make sure I understand and have used the product in order to give an educated review. It's important to note here that I received this product at discounted price for my honest and unbiased review. Still I try my best to provide all the useful details in the review rather than misrepresenting a products quality in order to please a seller and I know good sellers always look for true feedback.

I did receive this product at a discounted price or free in exchange for a fair and honest review, we take our time and study each product before we leave a review and are strongly thoughtful when we leave a review, we are very pleased with this item and feel that it's a great value that you will be pleased with as well, we appreciate you taking the time to read this and we hope it will help in your buying decisions, thanks again and have a great rest of the day !!!",Fantastic quality leather belt

positive,4.0,"This is a great watch for the price.  Like another reviewer, I also prefer easily read numbers to Roman numerals - or worse yet, plain linear graduation marks for each hour.  The large black numbers on the white face provide good contrast; it's very easy to see the time on this watch.  I also like the expansion band better than leather other bands that need buckles.  Furthermore, it's very accurate.  I've had the watch for several months now and it still has exactly the correct time according to the time.gov website.  One drawback is that the watch case is somewhat large.  If you have a small wrist it might look too big.  Luckily, my wrist is big enough so it's not an issue.  It's also a little tricky to shorten the band.  You need a good tweezers, a small jeweler's screwdriver (to release the spring pins), and a small needle-nose pliers would help.  With these tools and some patience you can do it yourself.","Good watch, good price"

This jacket has a classic look and appeal with bomber jacket styling. It's waterproof too,which is super handy if you get caught out in a storm and don't want to ruin your nice leather jacket. It fits really well and is generously cut in the shoulder area, a benefit for my hubby who likes to lift weights and has a larger upper back region due to athletics. The sleeves are perfect as well, niether too short or too long.  This is a hip looking, and sexy jacket particularly for the over 40 crowd. It's classy and simply ""feels good on"" as he says. I ordered one size larger so that he can comfortably wear his favorite sweaters underneath, and I'm glad I did this jacket in XL is perfect and has a bit of extra room for comfort.  5 stars, highly recommended!",My man loves this jacket!

positive,4.0,"The Peet Odor Eliminator is the sort of product that deep down you know you need. I had the perfect subject in mind....my husband's 20 year old hiking boots.

Once I received the Odor Eliminator, I went searching for the culprits, and finally found them isolated in the back of a deep closet. I nabbed them while inhaling and holding my nose. Yuk!

The first thing you notice about the Peet Odor Eliminator is that it looks like a pair of binoculars gone terribly wrong.

The second thing you notice is that you need four size ""C"" batteries (not included.) Not to fret, there is an AC adapter so batteries are not obligatory.

The instructions are extremely clear: insert an ""arm"" into each stinky shoe (or glove, hat, or whatever), turn the gizmo on and wait anywhere from 1-6 hours, depending on the ""odor type and situation.""

Quickly assessing the hiking boots, I guessed that 6 hours would probably not be enough, but certainly worth a try.

Using the highly scientific ""sniff test"" of my own devising (bending close to the subject and quickly inhaling through my nose) I came up with a sniffabiliy score of 1-10 with 1 being pleasant and 10 being the worst thing you ever experienced.

Prior to the start of treatment with the Odor Eliminator, the boots were awarded a 10.

After 15 minutes = 8 (Still disgusting but not capable of causing loss of consciousness)
1 hour= 6 (Nasty, just nasty)
2 hours=5 (Unpleasant)
3 hours=4 (Stinky but in the normal range of stinky)
6 hours=2 (Someone has worn this boot recently but did not perspire excessively and had very clean feet)

It was at this point that my husband came into the room and said ""what are my hiking boots doing out and what is that thing inside them?""

To me, a score of 2 is realistic for footwear and I didn't go for an additional 6 hour treatment. Besides, keeping the boots out for up to 12 hours seemed excessive. It also seems that periodic treatment would help maintain the boots in the ""normal"" range.

I also tried the Peet Odor Eliminator on a pair of my sandals. I inserted the arms of the device into my sandals which were placed into a partially closed paper bag so that the O3 would be able to flow around the insole and not immediately escape. I found that two hours of treatment was sufficient for a decent result.

It is important to note that this is not a fast solution for smelly problems, but it is a good solution if you are willing to spend four to six hours.","Admit It, You Need This!"

positive,5.0,"Mine came today and I immediately tried them out on the treadmill. They felt sturdy enough and are comfy, not to mention quite gorgeous on the feet.  I ordered an 8 wide, and the size is perfect.  I run a few times a week, no heavy mileage, and I'm also on my feet ALL day running errands, working at my kid's school, just...everything. I do wear orthotics and these shoes are pretty low compared to my last pair of New Balance running shoes.  So I had to remove the liner which had a padded heel cushion which if worn with my orthotics, raises my foot too high making it feel like my heel is coming out. I inserted the liner from my last New Balance shoes (which does NOT have a heel cushion), placed my orthotics over that and voila!  Perfect.  Also you can't beat the price here on Amazon.  I tried the same pair at the actual New Balance store (which did not carry it in wide width and would've needed to be ordered and take up to 10 days to receive ) and they would've cost me $80. I think these will work for a while.  Happy so far!","Comfy, attractive, and SO happy they come in wide"

positive,5.0,"I have a pair of Dansko clogs that are my favorite shoes. Unfortunately, the finish does not allow for regular shoe polish (the polish actually removes MORE of the finish than adding anything to it).

This is been a life-saver. I thought I was going to have to get rid of these shoes.

positive,5.0,"When getting set to travel, depending upon how long one will be away, there are decisions to make. Do I need my 28"" or just my 24"" possibly with a carry-on. For me, the answer for 2 or 3 day trips is the 24"" and maybe not a carry-on. But, let's be frank. Most 24"" suit cases will allow you to pack in approximately the same amount of clothing and what have you. Most have two exterior pockets. Don't think I've seen one without an interior accessory pocket (this one being mesh). And, there is usually included a detachable clear plastic ditty bag/cosmetic holder. This Wenger has all of those features. What, then, sets it apart? To some degree it is the styling, it looks good. But, I am a Wenger/Victorinox fan. Mostly, though, it is the quality craftsmanship, the attention to detail. The stitching is fantastic, no loose threads, and they are almost completely invisible. The top and side handles are quite secure, as well as well padded when you need to lift the bag for some reason. The wheels roll smoothly and turn on a dime. Never an issue with them. All of the zippers function exactly as they should, never a problem with any of them getting hung up or snagged. The exterior material is very durable. Because this one is not black when being thrown around the airport, in a plane or on the luggage carousel it can pick up some dirt/grease which would be visible. But it cleans rather easily. The aluminum handle extends very easily and there are two locking positions, though there is only about 2 inches difference between the two. The larger exterior pocket has two zippers allowing it to be locked. I generally stuff items in here that I want quick access to once I land, such as a windbreaker, my satnav GPS unit, etc. The upper exterior pocket will easily fit a collapsible umbrella. The interior lining is also quite durable. One thing I did notice when I first got this was that when I opened it there was not that odor that many suitcases seem to have and need to be aired out for a week or so. Not sure if that will be the same for all of them, but it was nice not to have the odor. All in all, a high quality product from Wenger Swiss Gear. It is really really good.","Hey, It's Luggage ...

positive,4.0,"While these tags don't provide ""active"" GPS location info, and they rely on the good will of others, they serve as what might be the next best practical thing.
I got my first one when taking my first trip to Europe. While my bag was never lost, I did do some testing of the tag and was satisfied with the information returned to me.
Yes, there are a lot of opportunistic and even dishonest people in the world, and these tags won't protect you from them or ""dyed-in-the-wool"" thieves, but if you consider that most bags are lost at some form of mass/public transportation facility, e.g. airport, train station, bus depot, or even a taxi, they provide you with a better chance of retrieving lost items than having nothing at all. ""Active"" devices would require a power source, and might conflict with airline requirements regarding signals they might broadcast.
On the last few trips I've taken, no one of any authority was checking/comparing baggage claim stubs to claimed baggage, allowing anyone to walk out with your bag, so no steps were apparently being taken to prevent errors and thievery from occurring. These are not a panacea, and would not prevent that, but are, instead, a relatively inexpensive measure to take to increase chances of recovering something lost of left-behind.
While they don't guarantee recovery of lost/stolen items, I feel using them gives me a better chance at it than not using them.
They're certainly pretty darn durable, too.","A gamble they'd be helpful, but better than nothing at all"

It fits exactly like you would expect from looking at the model in the picture: It is a reasonable size/tightness through the shoulders and arms and is tight around the hips. If you have slim hips, this shirt is the perfect design. If you are a pear, it will be a little tight around the hips. As a pear, I don't really like the way this fit me, but I kept it anyway. It is completely form fitting over my belly and rear. It's ok, but not flattering. The Aqua Design rash guards fit a pear body type better.

positive,4.0,"I wear these to work where there's a pretty formal dress code. They fit right in. The pleating on the front makes them look good and is a bit more comfortable than a flat front. Sometimes pants I've ordered online can be a size too big or small in the waist. The sizing is good. Well, the length is a little bit long. To be fair it seems that half the pants I've bought lately are this way. Maybe that ""pants on the ground"" thing is moving away from just being for jeans.

As far as how well they last over time.... Don't know. I've only had them a couple of months. They've held the crease well and don't wrinkle much if at all. I've had good luck with them. Hope you do too.

positive,4.0,"These boots seem very sturdy and undestroyable, and of high quality. True to size. The leather is thick and very nice looking and the details (stamping and lace hooks) are pretty. The soles are very (unusually I would say) thick. I really liked the leather lining - silky and so soft, you won't hurt your bare ankles wearing shorter socks.

I only wore the boots around the house, so I can't comment on how they hold up, though I'm sure they would do a superior job. I returned them because they are VERY heavy. I was going on vacation intending to walk for hours (8+) every day - I thought that these would make my legs tired sooner. I tried on many hiking boots before leaving and weighed all of them. Most were 13 oz, one or two pairs 16 oz, these were 19. Doesn't sound like a big deal, I know. But I could really feel the weight. 6 extra oz per step, thousands step per day - I think it would add up.

I chose Anhu Montara in Red Mahogany and fell in love with them during my vacation, never wanted to take them off! My second choice was Merrell Azura Carex in wine color (yes, I did want boots in as close to red color as possible) but I didn't believe their soles and they were not vibram. These Teva boots were my third choice.
For colder weather or really tough hikes I would choose Keen Gypsum. I was so sorry to let them go! So comfortable. I'm still thinking about getting them back.","very well made boots, nice color and cute details - but heavy"

We only use this to transport to and from daycare 4 times a week and it honestly doesn't get used much other than to drag around spare clothes in case it's needed at daycare (not actually opened often). So I am not sure how long it would last if you used it a lot.,Not high quality if needing for lots of use.

Well, in some ways it does. They fit nicely although the front is a bit snug and I still have to let the front straps about 1/4 loose like my Nike sandals. The instep is smooth and feels good to the feet unlike the rubbery Nike instep and other outdoors sandals instep in general (which will gradually feel better only after several wear), and the leather material looks nice too. It claims to be waterproof though I haven't tested them yet and the instep construction while creative (they're not glued to the sole, they're connected by velcro attachment) make squeaking sounds as you hit the ground.

It is true to size but i ordered half size up coz i want to have more room when it comes to boots.& so i can use really thick socks.

positive,5.0,"I broke my foot and needed a single shoe that would work with my medical boot, look professional for the office and provide support.  These shoes were great.  Now that I am slowly going back to regular shoes, I find that these give me enough support so that I can wear them about 7 hours.  After my full transition I figure they will work all day.  If you have a high instep, they may be a bit snug at first, but otherwise I like them better than Dansko and they are less expensive.  I wish they came in more colors.

positive,5.0,"I bought this ring to wear during trips so I could leave my wedding set in a secure place.  I had previously been using a titanium band, but it became scratched and dull after 2 trips.  After reading up on tungsten, I decided to buy this ring.  I *love* this ring.  The weight reminds me of platinum.  It is a domed ring,approximately 1mm thick, but I don't mind that. I find it to be very comfortable to wear.  I normally wear 3 bands on my ring finger and the 6mm width is perfect for me, as I've developed a permanent indent from my wedding set.  If your finger widens below the knuckle, this may rub a bit against your other fingers--but with Amazon's free returns policy on it give it a try.  I knew going in that the color would be gunmetal gray, which I find lovely--if you're looking for a silver-toned ring (i.e. silver/platinum/white gold appearance), this isn't for you. The shine on the ring is incredible and I'll be interested to see if it truly holds up.  After seeing it, my husband said ""maybe I should get one too!""--and he isn't a jewelry person at all--so that's a ringing endorsement from him.",Lovely ring (see pictures for true color vs ad picture)
positive,5.0,First of all...when you open this...be prepared to air it out. I inhaled it by accident and wish I hadn't. That said. It's perfect for the breast cancer walk.

positive,5.0,"Amazing wedding band!! Bought it for my husband and received it today, but  so far, I am very please with it. My husband is a little rough on jewelry (this will be the third wedding band in two years, we have tried 14k gold and titanium), and I am hoping that all reviews saying that tungsten is scratch-proof turn out to be true. This band has a nice weight to it, it's shiny, beautiful and fits good. Would definitely recommend and buy again! Can't beat the price, and the amazing quality! I love it and will be purchasing other items from King Will!

*Update: Turns out the band I originally bought for my husband was a little loose on him, even though it was his size (10.5). I bought him another one in a size 10, and it fits just fine. I love it! Not a single scratch on either one. Best money I've ever spent! Would buy over and over again!",Very happy customer!

These shoes have quickly become his favorites; and we now generally order 2-3 pairs at a time.  He finds the shoes to be one step above a minimalist running shoe...comfortable, breathable, and extremely lightweight, and yet well-cushioned.  He wears them for both training and races (marathons, halfs, and 10Ks).  The lifespan of the shoe is pretty good also; he usually gets 300-400 miles out of each pair.",My marathoner husband's favorite running shoe
positive,5.0,"Know why you want to order this hat?  Because you will not find any linen, ""ivy"" style cap as nice, or as accurately sized-fitted as this, from any online vendor operating in the US.

First, linen is far more difficult and costly to make than cotton-based fabrics.  The fiber it's made from is flax, and one of the few remaining regions in the world that still has a flax farming/manufacturing base large enough to manufacture large quantities of quality linen is ... guess where ... Poland and its surrounding areas/countries.

Second, I literally spent DAYS looking at the offerings of vendors all over the US trying to find a hat like this.  I ordered several, and had to return them all, mainly due to sizing issues.  I've got a big head, and I can never seem to find any caps that I like that quite fit me.  Even this vendor's largest size (XXL -- 62 cm) is right at the limit of the minimum for my head, which measures 61.5 cm.  One of the hats that I returned was SUPPOSEDLY an ""XXL,"" fitting up to 62 cm, but when I received it and measured the circumference of the band, it was actually just a little over 60 cm.  That cap wasn't constructed anywhere as nicely as this one, either.

I paid extra for expedited shipping on this one, and received it within one week of my order.  As I opened the box, I was just praying that it would fit, because this was my last chance to get the kind of cap I wanted to wear to an outdoor wedding ceremony in the coming week, and my time to find one was up.  When I pulled it out of the box and put it on my head, I practically wanted to cry ... it fit me PERFECTLY.  The quality/consistency of the linen is great, and craftsmanship/construction of the cap is very nice throughout.

In sum, I can't recommend this vendor/product highly enough.  Carefully measure your head; follow their instructions on sizing (e.g., if your head measurement falls between two sizes, order the slightly larger one), and you will be very happy.","Choose size carefully, and then buy with confidence!"

I didn't want ""fancy"" table napkins, I wanted something I could use to strain yogurt, wrap vegetables in the fridge, knot around my lunch (instead of using bags), or set out on the table at casual mealtime. The edges on these are hemmed, rather than just serged (which my last set of plain bandanna squares were). The cotton is lightweight and has an almost linen-like texture. I washed them immediately in hot water prior to use, and dried them on the clothesline. They seem to be cut on-grain and have remained square and straight.

The point of mine is droopy not pointy and upright as pictured. That isn't too bad and sort of adds a twisted wicked witch thing but the real disappointment is the brim.

There is a head covering that is fitted into the hat and the brim - and that is cool, keeps the hat snugged down and looks sophisticated... but the brim, although bent like shown, doesn't line up so that it has that nice graceful curve over the front.

positive,5.0,"I have to review this jacket because it has lasted over a year for us. My son is small for his age so take that into consideration. We bought this in November, 2015 when he was 8 months old and at 22 months, this size still fits (snugly but it fits). It's one of the only 6-12 things he still wears. He wears 18-24 mo in most pants and shirts. This is a fantastic jacket to wear in the car seat as it's not bulky at all and was recommended by the Car Seat Lady blog. It's been appropriate for temps as low as 40s and 50s. I plan to buy him a 2T next and let him grow into that one. Given how inexpensive this is, I was even more pleased it lasted that long. I wouldn't say there's much stretch to it but I feel it runs larger than normal shirt sizing.

positive,5.0,"A great backup for casual use that's always available.  Even if you like mechanical automatic watches, it's handy to have a backup when you're off doing something outdoorsy or if your watch or watches are in the shop.  Digital watches when used infrequently suffer from battery rundown when you need it.  The last thing you want to do is hunt down the appropriate battery--so you buy a new cheapie watch and throw the old one in the drawer.  This one runs by light power--I say ""light"" rather than ""solar"" because plain office light a couple of  hours a day is enough to keep this thing going.  Even then the dial goes blank and it goes to sleep, when exposed to light, it perks right up again.  If you keep it on desk or shelf as opposed to inside a dark drawer it should always keep the right time.  You may never need to buy a digital watch again.","Even if you like mechanical watches, this is a great backup that will always be there for you"

But you would think that the backs that are encased in silicone would be more secure. But it's the opposite. This set has tighter fitting backs than the other set.  Both sets they are tiny but the silicone ones slide on and off too easily. Afraid I will lose them. That makes me vote higher for this set.

It is really quality-made and it looks so dainty and perfect. The rose gold is a great compliment to warm skin tones and is great at add warmth to cooler skin tones. I wear a size 7 ring and so that's what I ordered. The fit is perfect. It's not too snug at all it, it hugs my ring finger on my left hand. The little Cubic Zirconia sparkle better than any I've ever seen.

Which is why I made a short video because really anything I say about this ring I want to prove :) I really do love it and I think it adds so much beauty to anything I'm wearing. I personally am preferring the rose gold color to my silver wedding set.

The box it comes in isn't what I would expect from a really high-end looking ring like this. It's just an orange, light material, gift box with a pattern of white triangles and the company name on it. If I were going to give this as a gift, I honestly might choose a fancier looking box because the box doesn't give their jewelry the credit it deserves. I mean it's not a bad box at all and I certainly don't purchase jewelry for the gift box, but it could be more.

Check out the video and watch this ring sparkle. I fell in love when I did!!

What a nicer way for dad to know you appreciate him, and think his kiddos have the best dad ever! I love that it comes in so many color options, however black was my favorite option, as it is next ti impossible to stain. The shirt itself is very nice. Thick and seemingly well made. It came with a paper saying ""there is nothing wrong with this t-shit"" explaining the printing process and why the ink on the shirt may look ""weird."" I think it looks great though, and even though the ink may be a bit broken in places it gives it character and by no means takes away from the shirt. My fiance usually wears a 2xl but these days I have been noticing them getting a bit snugger on him, so I am glad I bought a 3xl because it fits him just right with a lil wiggle room.

positive,4.0,"I really like this purse.  I purchased it to replace the giraffe print one that was stolen from me a few weeks ago.  The down sides on this - the straps are a little too short to go over my shoulder and still be comfortable.  Also, the pockets inside don't keep my meds as neat as I would like.  I think they need to be a bit deeper, or maybe the liner needs to be stiffer?  It does have three zippered pockets that are fine for keeping smaller things separated from the main compartment, but the two pouch-shaped pockets are pretty much useless.  Anything I put in there, meds, business cards, whatever, ends up sliding out, and mixed into the contents in the main portion of the purse.

It is a fairly large purse.  I could put my 4.6 pound dog in there if I didn't already have a wallet, a diabetic kit, and all sorts of other various things I need for my disability.  It has one large zipper on the top that will close the top up and several snaps on the sides to close up even the edges.  It seems to do a good job in keeping the purse closed up, but I wouldn't stress it by overloading the purse.  I am not sure that it would hold if the purse was straining.

The silver hardware seems sturdy and it is nice that each one is bascially a caribinger, so that I can clip things to each side of each strap.  I also like that it matches the zebra print wallet that I also ordered, so it looks like a set.  I also purchased a business card holder that is silver and red.  Overall, I am quite pleased, but there were those few things that bothered me, so I took off a start.  Thay may not matter as much to someone else, but I wanted to be sure that if you are buying it, you know that the straps are kind of short and the pockets not too secure inside.  THe outsite pocket is a zip pocket, so that is plenty secure.

It shipped quickly, and arrived before I expected it.  It was packed well.",Sassy purse.  Very fun.

positive,4.0,"I am always on the lookout for a new BB foundation creme.

La Roche-Posay Effaclar (seriously that name though) caught my eye. Oil absorbing, matte finish, SPF. I chose the light/medium because the fair light seemed TOO light.

I have fair skin, but pink undertones. The light/medium was too yellow undertone for me, it fits a more light olive toned skin. BUT my girlfriend loves it! Its perfect for her skin, and she loves the way it feels, and looks after hours of wear. I get to see it up close and it really does even out her skin, cover any blemishes and is matte all day.",BB Blur
positive,4.0,"These shoes are both stylish and functional. I use them for both lifting and roadwork, and they have held up for going on 5 months. The inside of the sole peeled pretty quickly after I started wearing them, but this is not a major problem.

Edit: I usually untie these shoes when putting them on/off. Today, I made the mistake of trying to don these while they were loosely tied. I crushed the back (this is the first pair of shoes where this has ever happened). After 5 or so minutes of tugging, it popped back into place and now works just the same as before. However, just a warning, don't use these as slip-ons.",Good Shoe

I think the fit is really flattering and they are just so comfortable, so I highly recommend these.

It arrived on time, fit well (I am 5""8, 145 lbs & the small fit perfectly), & looked great.  It says small is 6-8, and I also wear Banana Republic 6-8 sizes, as well as American Eagle the same. So it fit standard retailer sizes.

Unfortunately I forgot the hood at home, so I ended up looking like a truck-stop waitress. But heck, that is cute too.

positive,4.0,"My first time trying out Scott-Vincent Borba brand, which is featured on HSN, where you can see clips featuring the makeup artist behind the brand.  The packaging is beautiful, with much care and attention to details, explaining how to use.

I find the brush very soft and designed well for application of the powder.  The compact contains an inner piece you twist to grind just the amount of powder you need for your application.  I found the first time using that I had a bit more of the treatment than the makeup and my initial thoughts after applying was that I had a much lighter tone than my own.  Within a few minutes the powder matched up to my complexion and the look was smooth, bright and I felt like it was very natural.  I only wish there was a shade between the light and medium, as I found the light a little too light for me, especially as summer approaches.  I am a big fan of liquid foundation but would use this product when I feel like changing it up, especially in the warmer weather when a liquid base feels too heavy.

I found the powder did not irritate my skin, which can be slightly sensitive and can get a bit flushed -- no redness after using or breakouts.  Application with the included brush is easy and I can see this brush being excellent for bronzer as well.  The benefit of a dosage of skincare to your foundation with a high SPF (29) is a pleasant combo and I recommend for anyone looking for sun protection in a natural foundation.

Update: I've been playing around with this product and find it gives a beautiful finish over my usual liquid foundation.  It beautifully tones down the shine from liquid base, without being too matte or chalky.  It photographs well and I find I just need a light touch, so this compact should last quite some time used this way.","Easy application, soft brush, natural looking powder plus treatment"

I use it with the undercover mama tanks and slide up my blouse, slide down my nursing tank and bra cups and put this on over my clothes, hook up my Medea pump pieces and bam! The size really does vary and is adjustable. The material is very stretchy and always bounces back even though the cups are stretched several times a day to put on and remove my pump accessories!

positive,5.0,"These ""Dark Used"" jeans are 85% cotton,  13% polyester and 2% elastane.  The jeans come right up to one's hips. The fabric molds to one's body.  There is definitely some stretch to the material, which can make these warm in hot weather, but are comfortable while sitting down and standing. The jeans stretch out over the day and shrink back during the wash cycle.

These jeans fit snugly from waist to knees, then flair out some to the ankles.  No butt crack!  The dye has that ""used"" look in the thighs down to the knees, but is even across the butt and legs. Front pockets are small (3"" deep) but back pockets are deep enough for a normal wallet, 5"".

I am thrilled I bought this watch at $163.00 with free shipping! It's almost too good to be true. My watch had plastic protection on it as well as the watch pillow that the two tone MK watch was securely on. I did have to have my spouse remove 4 links for me to fit like a Boyfriend watch. Substantial weight. A STUNNER for sure! I would absolutely recommend this watch as a gift to a loved one, or a special treat for yourself. I debated between this watch & the Seiko two tone watch priced at $129.00. I'm so glad I decided on this one. The face is perfect and the size is spot on! Definitely unisex. I will keep you updated in 3 months to report back how the watch is holding up. 5 BIG stars for fast delivery, great representation of product, efficiency of the seller, and oh my the price!!! Thank you! I adore it so much. Now looking for a Rose Gold watch by MK. I'm sold on the quality and the overal watch itself. DO NOT HESITATE... Go for it! You will not regret this purchase!

positive,4.0,"I've been using these shoes the past 3months specifically for squats and deadlifting. They are lightweight and have a solid flat sole that works great for those exercises.
I got the black/gold color, it looks badass to say the least. I usually wear a size 8, which is what I ordered and the length fits fine. Although, even with normal sized feet the shoes do feel pretty tight around the ball of your feet at the knuckles. The sides of my feet would really hurt doing movements like calf raises. What i've been doing lately is keeping the laces loose throughout the bottom and just tightening it at the top (ankle) and tying them.
I strictly use these shoes for my leg days at the gym about twice a week for around 2hrs. They are still very much intact. I wouldn't recommend walking around with them for the day. My feet were aching and for some reason the mesh on the insides are really rough when first using them. They left scabs on the sides of my legs from all the chaffing throughout the day.
All that aside, if you're looking for cheap squat / deadlifting shoes that look and work great then these are definitely an option. Just take a week to break them in and leave the laces loose at the bottom.","Great for Squats and Deadlifts, but tight"

positive,4.0,"So wonderful to find a ""leather"" bag made of actual, old-fashioned, non-processed (at least I think it is, or isn't) full-grain leather! Oh, and  to find such a bag NOT MADE IN CHINA! I have recently purchased other ""leather"" totes from another manufacturer/source to find that they smell chemical-like, or just gross. But this smells like the saddles and the good bags of my youth, and I am really pleased. I ordered the red, and I'm bummed because the photo made the red look more like cognac, or a browner red. This is a clear red, no bones about it, a little too happy and bright for me, though I'll give it a day or so to grow on me before making up my mind. Inside the bag, it's lined with a khaki cloth, light enough to be able to see what's inside. It's big enough for my chromebook, and the zipper on top makes it secure.
Update: After checking several Piel bags out, I found that the dark brown leather in this style was the most luxurious looking, and the leather the thickest. It seems Piel uses different types of leather for different bags.",Feels like (and smells like!) full-grain leather -- how refreshing!! But I wish it came in cognac ;(

are perfect!

positive,4.0,"So dry.  SOOOO, SOOO, SOOO dry.

If you have oily skin, absolutely give this a try.  If your skin is combo or dry, PREP YOUR SKIN.  Exfoliate, moisturize, throw on some rose water.  Then let this warm on your skin (or in your hand) before you try blending it.  My skin is combo/dry and this formula was much hard to work with than I anticipated.  (Also, use a setting powder, it, ironicially, helps it look less dry.)

As for coverage, I would describe this as fair to good, but far from exceptional.  I confess that I was expecting more from this brand's reputation.  Amazon has given me the option to try a wide variety of Demablend products, and with the exception of the setting powders and *possibly* the pigment drops, there's really nothing I've tried that I think I would try again. The coverage has (on none of them) met the hype of the brand's reputation.  They've been above average (compared to products from other brands), but they aren't ""amazing"" and I've found almost every product to be drying.

ALL color images for this brand look lighter than the color in person.  I would suggest you seek out additional color images (or visit a cosmetic counter) before deciding on your color selection.

The products did not irritate my sensitive skin beyond the discomfort of the dryness.",Expected more from the brand.

positive,5.0,"I continue to be impressed with the customer jewelry available from Amazon. These earrings of cubic zirconia stones and multi-toned plated metal look like the real deal.

Tasteful little CZ diamonds, set in two tones of gold, spiral in to the center at angles made to catch light. They circle a larger faceted stone that appears to dangle from the middle. If these were big earrings, they'd scream costume. It's their small size that lends to the illusion. If I didn't know, I would easily believe them to be made of solid precious metals set with true diamonds.

Another plus of being diminutive is having daytime and nighttime versatility. Despite having lots of stones in a design with some complexity, being small brings a degree of subtlety. I think anyone that confidently mixes and matches styles could work them with casual as well as business and evening dress.

positive,4.0,"I was looking for a wallet that would hold cash, change, and a ton of cards (credit cards, insurance, store rewards cards, etc.).  This wallet does hold all my stuff, with extra clear slots for a few wallet photos of my family.  Tons of slots and pockets for organizing everything.  This is a huge wallet so you probably wouldn't like it if you carry a tiny purse!

Unfortunately I just found this wallet too large and awkward.  Putting my checkbook in the wallet made it very fat and bulky.  Even without the checkbook, the wallet has a built-in checkbook flap and a built-in flap with clear slots for photos/IDs.  These two flaps PLUS the outside flap that snaps it all together just made it take too long to find the card I needed -- I don't like fumbling around with my wallet while people behind me wait in line!  I might reconsider this wallet if the checkbook flap and photo flap were removable, but as is, I didn't think this is a very user-friendly wallet.  Also, the pen loop is much wider than your average pen, so your pen will fall out unless you slide it all the way down so the pen clip goes over the loop -- and then the tip of the pen will stick out the bottom of the wallet!

For color reference, I ordered Cobalt which was fairly true to the color I see on my monitor (which is a lighter blue than a true cobalt).  The outside is faux leather and all interior components are fabric.",Truly a Big Fat Wallet!

The feel is closer to barefoot than any other shoe I have worn; I prefer them to vibrams because you can reasonably wear socks and they are more comfortable and I would say slightly more durable.

I have ran in these shoes, worked countless hours on a factory floor in them, and as a sending off after 11 months I wore them in a tough mudder. (If you're gonna wear these in a tough mudder you will be better off barefoot.) If you have feet that can handle hitting the ground under their own support like mine, i highly recommend them.

4 stars because this particular pair had a hard spot that gave me a small blister on my pinky toe before they were broken in, which rarely happens to my caveman feet. I cannot remember the last time a new show gave me a blister.",and it was the best shoe I ever owned

positive,5.0,"Okay, let's get this out of the way - this backpack is expensive. I admit if this weren't available as a Vine item, I wouldn't pay so much for a backpack because I'm too frugal. But, if you're looking for a designer-label backpack for the masses, you're already prepared to pay a bit more for the item.

The bag is suitable for all genders. I can fit an older 15"" Macbook Pro circa 2009 with a non-SSD hard drive and a Super-Drive in the lightly padded laptop pocket, with the two corners touching the top of the bag without stretching the bag or struggling to stuff it in. I've already decided this bag is what I'll use to transport my old laptop.

The backpack is very classy and understated, which is how I prefer my products. The outer material feels very sturdy and uses thicker nylon fabric. The inside is lined, unlike many cheaper backpacks. The zippers slide smoothly. The zipper pulls are big for easy zippering. The bottom panel has something stiff inside for support, giving this a bit more structured look. The slightly rounded boxy look also uses space more efficiently.

I like that the bag doesn't have a dozen compartments. It doesn't have a special panel for headphone wires, pen holders and other tiny pockets. Besides the laptop pocket, the main compartment has two additional pockets and a zippered compartment, along with the zippered outer compartment. However, I do wish this had a water bottle holder, though I admit adding one would take away from its simple, refined look.

This has a bit of that premium feel than the book bags I'm used to. The black color gives this an elegant look. It's a very nice bag without screaming, ""I'm expensive - steal me.""","Classy, comfortable, sturdy backpack made of nice material."

I just use the microbags that came with the glasses as padding between them so the lenses don't get scratched. I don't believe this case is sturdy enough for really rugged use. It's not a solid, hard case, and any really hefty weight placed on it would crush the glasses inside. If you're looking for a piece of indestructible armor for your glasses, this is not it.

positive,4.0,"Just got this a couple days ago.  Every time my wife flies back to her hometown, it's hit or miss whether her large suitcase will be over or under the 50 lb. weight limit.  This should help, although I haven't tried it yet with a loaded suitcase.

I also had an ulterior motive for purchasing this.  I play, and have several, bass guitars.  Whenever I buy or sell one, the first question usually asked is, ""How much does it weigh?""  Now I'll have a pretty fair estimate.  I weighed my basses this morning, and this scale appears to be pretty accurate.  My only concern is that because there isn't anything on the bass itself to hook onto the hanger part of the scale, I weighed them with the straps on.  But when I tried to weigh one of the straps by itself to see how much weight it added to the total weight of the bass, it isn't heavy enough to register on the scale.  So I'll probably just deduct one ounce from the weight I get of the bass with the strap on.

It does appear to be more accurate with heavier objects like a suitcase.  So all-in-all, I'm glad I got this.  It should be very helpful when flying.",Handy Little Helper

They survived the abuse of old cobblestone streets and repeated walks of 20 minutes or more. The wheels are great, and it's easy to transition the way you're pulling it, or to go from pulling to pushing very smoothly without the wheels catching.

positive,5.0,"After enjoying some southern California sunshine and warm weather, I returned home to cold, snowy, rainy weather; giving me an opportunity to evaluate this Saiveina umbrella sent to me in exchange for an honest evaluation and review.  It's neither too big and bulky like a doorman's umbrella nor too small.  There is a powerful spring in the handle that will quickly open this umbrella at the push of a button and then collapse it with another push of the button.  Compressing the handle cocks the spring that provides the double action.

Yesterday, while using this umbrella to protect me from a rainstorm while walking from my car to a nearby building, I encountered an violent gust of wind that turned it inside out.  Considering the intense force of the wind gust, I expected the umbrella to be bent and damaged but it was not.  When I pressed the button on the handle, the umbrella retracted normally from it's inverted condition and was completely unharmed.  When closed, this umbrella is just 12 1/2 inches long, making it easy to stow under the seat of a car, in a briefcase, handbag or backpack.  The fabric dries quickly.  When open it's large enough to keep me dry when I'm not in a windy rain.  Despite its tough construction, this umbrella weighs just 13 ounces, making it easy to recommend.",Tough Umbrella Survived Violent Wind Gust

I really love Lucky brand Women's tops, but I don't think this is a good fit for me with the baseball shirt type shoulders. It just makes me look bigger than I am. X1 is my size though, maybe I am too old or busty to wear it. The model has much broader shoulder than me, and it hangs well on her.

I question that but it does look like leather.  It has a different smell to it but it's not bad and it went away in a short time.  It may be the shipping wrap that they use.  It still does not smell like leather though.  What I really like is the lining.  It appears to be satin and it is sewn in very tightly and does not hang loose when I'm digging in the bag for something.  I love that!  There is plenty of room for just about anything you would want to carry.

positive,5.0,"Love the fabric!  Fits a little large but I ordered large.  My experience has been that scrub tops run small.  I like to have room in my shoulders when moving/lifting patients.

You have to look closely at the image to see if its the same material, which can be tricky!",Love HeartSoul
positive,4.0,"Light weight crew sock that's perfect for the warm climate where I live. Fits well. Very comfortable. The one negative is the lack of any reinforcing around the heel or the toe area, so they wear out fairly quickly. Still, the price is right.",Nice sock for warm climates

positive,5.0,"I ordered medium size. They are on the roomier side so I am thinking small size would have done just fine. But since I use them to lounge around the house, the looser fit works well for my needs. If you order the correct fit, they are good enough to wear outsides. The style is very flattering.

positive,4.0,"So these are great for the price.  They are really soft, comfortable and do offer a surprising amount of support (which is number one for me).  However, there are a couple really annoying flaws that would be deal breakers if it weren't for the fact that they are cheap.  The material that connects to the strap when the cup is unclipped and open is too stretchy and thin and doesn't keep the strap in place when nursing.  So the strap with the connection clip slips higher up on the shoulder and makes hooking back on after nursing really difficult.  I rarely can get it re-hooked with one hand. Very inconvenient when nursing in public since I have to set baby down somewhere before being able to re-hook my bra.  The one other issue I have with these are that the strap adjustments don't stay in place and slide down blocking the nursing clips.  So not only is it almost impossible to re-hook with one hand, the stupid strap adjustments get in the way too.  Such a dumb design flaw that could easily be solved if the straps adjusted in the opposite direction (from the back).  So yeah, the re-hooking problems of these bras would be total deal breakers it the sellers were trying to sell them for more money.  But since they're cheap, comfortable and supportive, I like them. Even with the annoying issues I still give them 4 stars bc I am very impressed by the incredible shape and lift these bras give, especially for being wireless.  They really look great on.","Comfortable and supportive, but issues with re-hooking clips."

positive,4.0,"I would not wear these out of the house. They are very comfortable, but they are also a little see-through. The material itself is soft and very stretchy. It's also pretty thin. So thin in fact that I may have to come back to update this review if they don't last very long. Despite washing instructions, I just threw them in with the rest of my laundry. They have been washed in a regular cold cycle and then dried on the regular/high heat setting on the dryer. And so far they've held up pretty well. These are supposed to be capri style pants, but they are only a couple of inches from touching the floor when I wear them. I mean I am 5' 1 1/2'' but still.

Full disclosure: I had the opportunity to purchase these leggings/yoga pants at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. This opinion is 100% my own and I have no affiliation with the seller of this product.","They are very comfortable, but they are also a little see-through"

positive,5.0,"Green is my favorite color and this is a dark olive, and shows really nice.  The two contrasting greens between the band and the different shade of green inside the bezel with the gold nut and strip accents on the watch make this really eye catching.  I have a decent watch collection, and think this is one of the favs.  It is a larger watch, and may feel bulky to people but that has not affected me at all.  I tend to like heavier watches and watches with the larger wrist pieces but I know that is not everyone's taste.  The only advice I have is to mind to the size.  If you tend to wear watches that are larger than this is the watch for you but if you like slim watches, this may not be your style.",Love love love this watch
positive,5.0,"These are great 'granny panties' when used without the pads.  They fit tight, stay in place an no panty lines.

positive,5.0,"I love this shirt! It's a very comfortable tee, and the writing is great! It fits as expected which I'm glad because some are made smaller than what the sizing shows. I'm not one to really buy clothes online without being able to try them on. I like 'thinner' teeshirts instead of the thick/stiff kind. This definitely meets my expectations. I wore this out and about and I got quite a few laughs and thumbs up. Afterall, who doesn't love BATMAN?! This shirt brought back some memories from my childhood when I used to watch Batman with my dad. The only problem with this shirt, I should've bought two, one for me and one for my husband because we 'fight' over who wants to wear it. I received this item in exchange for my honest review.",I love this shirt

positive,5.0,These boots are amazingly comfortable and particularly light (which is what stops me from usually purchasing boots).  I can wear these all day.  I have an orthotic that fits nicely into the boot and my foot does not get squished - a nice change.  They are great for office attire and jeans. Took me about 10 minutes to break them in.  The leather sole is definitely not for inclement weather - rain or snow - as it can be very slippery.,Frye finally gets it!!!

positive,4.0,These were super cute but too snug a fit for my daughter. They run a bit small. I would recommend ordering 1 size bigger than normal for these shoes.,These were super cute but too snug a fit for my daughter
positive,4.0,"I have several of these in a few colors, including ones with lace trim.  They are a great smoothing tank to wear under clothing.  The best thing about them is they are long enough!  They are not binding at the bottom, they have the bottom part looser, which is great design-wise.  The straps are adjustable.  But don't expect TOO much slimming effect, they smooth but are not as slimming as SPANX.  I am not a small woman, I'm 5'8"" a size 12 with a DDD chest, and I wear a MEDIUM in these.  The large or xl will not slim you at all unless maybe you're plus-sized 18 or over, so order down so it's tighter, you want to feel held in.

If you want cleavage, this doesn't show too much, but it's a plus in the top part for me because it's not tight up top and doesn't flatten me out.

Overall a good buy for light slimming and everyday wear.","Great for light slimming, and order a size down"

positive,5.0,"Originally I rated this dress 4 stars but had to change it to 5 stars after wearing it. I felt 100% sexy but still classy in this dress. My date said it was sensory overload! I am also happy with the quality. It held up very well. I'm leaving my original review listed below. However, after getting the correct undergarment, I bought a waist trainer/cup-less corset to flatten my stomach and hide any buldges...it was a perfect fit plus the corset gave my breasts a lift since you can't wear a bra with this dress. The dress fit beautifully! I'm 5'4 132 lbs 36C.  If you're really skinny the one size fits all may be too loose.  It was perfectly tight but the thick material kept it smooth, the low v cut accentuated the girls and it was short showing off my legs and hugging my butt perfectly. It is a sexy dress..not for someone who is modest. The dress length would have shown my panties if I bent over. Probably the sexiest thing I own!

Original review: the dress could have fit a little tighter especially in the chest. Its definitely sexy..I will be wearing spanks for sure as it does show imperfections. I also read about the white piping popping up instead of laying down..that is happening but a little fabric tape should do the trick (i used a safety pin and the piping stayed flat and smooth). It is very short too.",Buy this dress! Fit great! Love this dress!

* Very elegant and sturdy design
* I love the fact that is not shinny, but a matte finish
* I like the color-line around it; It adds a very nice touch
* Cushions are also well made and soft, but do keep their shape

The only concern I must express is that while all cushions are armed with watches, there seems to be a enought room/space for the watches to tilt to sides.  But this could be one's personal preference as some may find it a plus when pullling one the watch to wear.

I certainly recommend it and would buy again both as gift and personal.","Classy, indeed."

My only complaints are that one of them was quite brittle and it snapped when it was bent a bit. I have not found this to be true of the other ones, so I assume that this one may have just had a weak spot. Either way, I will simply glue it it back together as it is not a big deal.

Stitching is perfect to my eye, leather is supple and there is plenty of room for necessary and the usual items you carry. While it is not shown in the picture you can use a top slot to put a wallet insert with your pictures and cards in it.

positive,5.0,"After returning 3 shoes I was getting fatigued. ALL of them were too small, too narrow, and/or totally uncomfortable. 13 is 13 guys.. Half of the size 13's I purchased felt like 11's!

So I ordered these, and was PLEASED. They fit remarkably well, don't crowd the feet, and are light - yet they feel well made. Also - they are flat out attractive looking, and I get compliments on them at work all of the time. I'm already 6'4"" tall, and these add a FULL INCH to my height which is awesome bonus! I was looking for shoes to make me 1-3 inches taller, and these also help in that regard. Who doesn't like a tall dude?

So in summary.. Well built. Increase height. The width of 'normal' feet. The sizes ARE the sizes - no lie.

I ordered a second pair to keep them on-hand.. Everytime I find something I like they stop carrying them, not this time! I have a couple of years of shoes ready to go.

If I ordered my normal 7 1/2 they would probably be a bit too snug if I wore thick socks so I'm glad I went half size up.

Pretty good material and quality, I've worn them a lot and there's been no issues.

The strap is nice but is very proprietary to the watch. The leather is straight cut and inserted into a fastening slot which has two fine tip screws underneath on either end which hold the strap secure, To replace, it could be done if you find a 28mm strap and cut the watch pin slot portion off with a razor and straight edge.

 Looks like it will last a long time though with casual wear. I like it more for its looks and comfortable design but seems to be durable as well. Stainless case, mineral glass which is flush with case so it is susceptible to damaging without care upon smacking it on any hard surfaces.
 Overall a very nice easy reader which sits well in case size, profile and comfort being light weight.
It is a dark display which I see some complaints upon but, it is the design factor in play here. That feature gives the watch its stealthy look. personally, I think its great and not at all hard to read. I'm 51 and wear glasses for anything within two foot of my nose. If the strap was a standard pin fastening design, I would give it 5 stars.",KC Stylish Slim Casual Watch

They just fit my body the best and this amazon price is a bit lower than in store prices. I ordered to pack's and they both came in cute colors and prints. I got a purple-ish brown, a white with tiny pink and purple dots all over it and lastly a light pink. I often wear cloth pads and I do find that these hipster panty's are a bit wide in the gusset region for me for click my cloth pads in place but it's not horribly uncomfortable, I just need to buy more of these in bikini style I suppose.

So if you also find that the fabric right there  between your greats is too bulky you can trim it just be very careful and don't go overboard but if you ca sew a few stitches then by all means go Florida it because it felt perfect free that.its the ""price""lol you pay for buying online.

They are too large to work well, dull the blades quickly, and sometimes require enough force to risk cutting yourself badly if the blade slips or the spring-pin comes out unexpectedly.  This tool works better because not only is the tip small enough to reach into the tiny gap in metal bands, but also the slight bend of the tip allows one to apply significant leverage on the pin without the risk of stabbing yourself.  The replacement blades are a nice addition.  But for the price of this, buy two!  They're well worth the money.",dull the blades quickly

positive,5.0,"I bought this corset for my Halloween costume. I have owned several corsets so I knew it was important to take my measurements. I am a 14-16 and I ordered a 5x. I can lace it completely so there is no gap between the back panels. I probably could have ordered a size smaller but since I'm not interested in cinching it tightly to shrink my waist the 5x fit very well. Now I would mention that this is a very light weight corset that has ribbons instead of laces. It's not what you want for true waist training. But for a costume, outer wear or just to dress up for you partner it's a good buy for the price. I was pleased with my purchase and it shipped fast. I also purchased the ""Steampunk Victorian Gothic Skirt"" from Pirate Dressing and the ""Yomoko Sexy Deep V-Neck"" to wear under it.",Measure your waist!

positive,5.0,"Okay so recently my husband was asked to be in his best friends wedding. He asked him that he need to get a green tie, any color green . So we have been going to everywhere to find the right color tie and he has been able to find one. So I was so freakin lucky that I was able to have found this tie on AMZ Review Trader and I had to snag it, so I ordered it and I'm so happy that I got it in a couple of days. The material is even better than what the pictures show here. This product picture doesn't give this time and pocket square any justice. He tried it on and it fits him perfectly and it looks so good on my husband, the color is so beautiful and I know he will rock this wedding. The pocket square is even beautiful. The material is not cheap, it's very strong and very well made. I will definitely be buying the other color for him so he can have a variety of ties, just in case he needs to wear a suit again. I know I will be getting my dad this time set as well. I know he will probably wear this time again for his annual company Christmas party. I highly recommend this time set. It's very elegant and a beautiful tie set. I know any man/woman will look great in this time. Plus who doesn't like a well made experience looking tie and pocket square.

positive,5.0,"Just a lovely ring in every way.  First, the pearls (freshwater) are real ... and I really prefer decent freshwater pearls to any but the best of saltwater pearls anyway (akoya, south sea, Tahitian ... doesn't matter).  These are round and appear to be good quality.  The setting is appropriate for an adult.  In fact, it is a rather largish bypass.  You won't be able to wear this ring with another on the same finger.  If you are particularly tiny-handed, it might well extend over the adjacent joints.

In other words, it has enough size to establish a presence, and would be well-coupled with a pearl bracelet for a classic dress look.  That the setting is platinum-plated is a really strong plus for those who can't tolerate silver (e.g., those with acidic skin) - and it's hard to find in costume jewelry.  The stones (c. zirconia) add sparkle and movement.  While cubic zirconia can sometimes look a little over-bright, say in a yellow gold setting, they are an excellent choice for a pearl ring in a white setting.

Sizing is true.  Fit and finish is excellent, as is the price.  This ring is a really good buy.",What a Nice Piece!

positive,5.0,"Let me start by saying this was good for the price, as in since I only paid $17 I wouldn't mind paying a few more dollars for adjustments. I bought the small and I'm 4' 11"", 108 pounds and 34c fake boobs. The small fit good, it was stretchy, only things I didn't like we're the sleeves under the armpit, like other reviewers stated, you need tape to hold it on, it's because the way the bodysuit is sewn, when you move your arms at all it pulls the fabric up and away from your chest, causing your lady parts to fall out (at least mine did) so that I would have to have fixed (the armpit needs to be sewn higher up to prevent this from happening). Also the back doesn't fit snug to your back, so I worried with a bandage skirt on, it would make the back scrunch up and not lay flat like a normal bodysuit. That I would have to have fixed by taking the waist in on the sides so it fits my body better and doesn't have the extra fabric. I provided pictures of what I'm talking about with the armpit and the back. The picture of the back shows what it looks like circled, and what it should look like (with me pulling it tighter). Overall this is a great bodysuit for the price, it's very stretchy and thick material, so it's very well made. I sent mine back only because after debating, I didn't feel like I would get much use out of it here, maybe try it in southbeach or somewhere where I could wear more risqu things to the club, not this town!

positive,5.0,"I love this plaid shirt by Meaneor. It is stylish and very well made. It fits exactly as the size chart indicates. I ordered the large and it is exactly what I wanted. I wear a 6-8 or medium in most shirts, but wanted to be able to comfortably wear a tank or t-shirt underneath this, so I ordered a larger size.

The material is soft but strong, it is not easily wrinkled (maybe not at all) and holds the collar and cuffs well. It is very nice looking on, and could easily be dressed up with dress slacks for a more pulled together look. All of the stitching was done with great attention and the pattern is lined up from panel to panel.

The colors and pattern are as they appear to be and are well saturated through the material. It does not look like it will fade at all over time. All of the button holes are well placed and stitched and each corresponding button fits through it's hole easily. The buttons are also solidly attached to the shirt. I found no stray threads on the entire shirt.

This shirt also has darting in the sides on the chest near the underarms to make it more form fitting for ladies. I like this feature, because often shirts like this do not and end up looking boxy and drab.

I received this item complimentary for my true and objective opinion. I personally tested this product and my assessment is not influenced by Amazon or the seller.","Fits great, nice quality."

For sizing reference: I'm a 38D chest size with a somewhat small torso. I'm 5'9 and weight 160lbs. It covers the belt on my pants so it's fairly long. The sleeves are perfect and reaches my wrists even when I lift my arms. The bottom of the hoodie does not ride up when lifting my arms also. This item fit me snugly. It was not baggy and not too tight to where I couldn't breath lol. I would recommend this to other friends.

It picks up the perfect amount of product and fits into the hollow of my cheek nicely. I can use it to deposit the color more precisely then blend it out as well. It blends powder really well. The brush handle/ferrule seem sturdy as well, it's not loose at all. Overall this brush is a total steal.

The oval cream powder brush I haven't used as much as the contour brush but it's only because I don't know how to incorporate it into my personal routine. I use a sponge to apply liquid foundation & concealer and use a kabuki brush to apply powder. I have tried this brush for blush and highlight and it's done a decent job. The brush handle feels pretty cheap, it's a light plastic. I thought this would be a really affordable dupe to the Artis brushes makeup artists are raving over. I haven't had the chance to try an Artis brush because they're well out of my price range. I will say that this brush is, again, incredibly soft and densely packed just like the contour brush. It feels like HEAVEN. I want to just rub it around my face all day. This is a neat brush to try out and the price makes it worthwhile.

The sponge is the one item I could probably do without, which is why I rated 4 out of 5 stars. Once you've used a beautyblender, there's really no going back. This one is an okay substitute but not nearly as good as my beautyblender. It's very dense and almost tough feeling. The BB is very light and springy in comparison, and this is just about as opposite as you could get. It applies foundation and concealer alright but absorbs too much of the product for my liking. I do appreciate that the bundle comes with a small mesh bag you can put this sponge into to keep it clean while it dries.

Overall a very good affordable collection of beauty tools. I did receive a discount on my purchase of this set however my opinion is in no way affected by that. I like these bruses and sponge and use them regularly and would recommend them to others.",Great Brushes at a Great Price!

positive,5.0,"I ordered a medium for my GF (5'3"", idk maybe 120ish pounds?). I'd usually get her a small for all bottoms, but I read another review that said these are asian sizes, and so are smaller than US sizes.

I didn't want my gf to feel bad about not fitting a small, so I just ordered the medium. Turns out, the medium was too big for her and she really did need the small. Also, the material is slightly stretchy so keep that in mind.

Really high quality. I was surprised because Ive seen my gf order other clothes online that come in and its like 4 pieces of clothe stitched together wrong. This was definitely something you'd see at a boutique shop. probably could resell them at a boutique if you had one.","High quality, sizes seem to be regular US sizes. Go with the size you usually wear. They even have a slight stretch."
positive,4.0,"I have been running on these for about 4 months.  I put about 20 - 30 miles per week on them since I bought them with a grand total of just over 300 miles on them (I alternate between 2 pairs of these for longer life).  They have been going strong but are now starting to show signs it's time to replace them.  Most of my miles are on road pushing a baby jogger and these have held up to the task with flying colors.  Like most minimalistic shoes, yes you can feel sharp rocks but the rock is 2 steps behind you before your brain registers you stepped on it, at least that's how it does it with me.  These shoes have gone up to marathon distances without any issues.

I have only one gripe about them, you need to wear socks.  My first run in them was without socks, as I prefer to run in hotter weather.  I got a great big blister on my arch from a seam inside the shoe.  Since then I added a little body glide before long runs and have not had any issues.  I point this out because the shoe stated it was great for running without socks.  The time I got the blister it was only a 4 mile run so it was not like it was a long distance where I have learned to expect blisters.

Aside from this the shoes are  great investment.  I just ordered a new pair for a Christmas present to me.",Great lightweight minimalistic running shoe.

But that was before I discovered Keen. That big black toe box that I used to think was ugly on casual shoes has now become a required element on every shoe I buy. It's a lot like the VW Beetle- you grow to love it. I love Keen and now have casuals, winter boots and hiking boots with the same beautiful big black toe box. I finally gave in and bought the sandals. Now my toes are still happy but my feet can enjoy the air that they haven't felt in many years of wearing sneakers. PEW! The soles on these are amazingly comfy and they are really well made in real leather and waterproof unlike most sandals. I'm impressed.",Never had any use for sandals until Keen.

They are Hanes though, so I'm not too worried. The second thing that is new to me is the leg holes seem narrower than I'm used to. I'm thinking this helps keep things contained, which it certainly seems to. I thought it might limit mobility of my legs, but maybe only a couple times have I even noticed them.

It kinda catches on my clothing and I'm a little concerned that the stone with eventually fall out because of it. To be fair, the ring is such a low price ($2) so it's not totally surprising.

She lives in another state, but flew home the day I placed the order. They arrived during her visit, and she went nuts over them! (this was before she even opened the box).After squeezing the sh*t out of me with a hug, she grabbed the boots and put them on. They were gorgeous at first sight! They fit exactly the way she hoped, they looked the way she had hoped, and in fact, she wore them Friday evening to an event only a few hours after getting them! She wore them for about 7 hours, and commented that they were still comfy. BEST hundred bux spent for her, if I do say so myself! Great job, Chinese Laundry, and bravo, Amazon Prime, for once again coming through for me, with next day shipping for a mere 3.99, which was so so worth it!

positive,5.0,Love these and will be buying more!!,Perfect lifting shorts.
positive,5.0,"Really awesome product. Although we've only used it once so far, it was a breeze adjusting and putting on my son. Some Pro's and Con's..

Pros:
- Very professional and attractive packaging.
-Liked the idea of a product that could be registered for warranty
-adorable design/pattern
-Nice material
-Company seems to take much pride in their product
-The ""for best results"" and ""for worst results"" instructions on the tag for washing was a cute and humorous addition

Cons:
- I didn't like that the rivets on the inside were all the way through both layers of material. I feel as though that would get annoying or even painful on baby's skin. I read in a review somewhere that the newer version has the rivets through only the first layer of material so they don't rub on baby's skin, but that wasn't the case for the item I received, and I was under the impression that I was purchasing whatever model was up-to-date for this product.
- Says it fits 8-36 pounds, however my son is 3.5 months old, and although he's huge for his age, he's 17.5 pounds and on the last set of snaps for width adjustment, and the middle setting for rise adjustment. This is a disappointment, as it won't last longer than this summer.","Great product, some flaws"

My other watch is an automatic and a pain to maintain.  I'm always adjusting it. This is a great looking quartz watch under $200 and just keeps on ticking.  Btw, Seiko also makes a similar one in automatic if you really want one.

One thing that is worth mentioning is that when the chronograph is operating, the 1/20 hand is constantly spinning.

positive,4.0,"This lightweight handheld luggage scale is the sort of thing that you'll never need until you really need it-- I write this sentence as someone who has had to repack my bags in the middle of the International Departures terminal of the international airport in Porto, Portugal.

It's simple to use: you simply pass the heavy canvas strap though the handle of your suitcase, hook it,and lift your bag by the double handle of the scale.  The weight can then be read in the LCD window, in either pounds or kilograms (you can switch them back and forth at the push of a button-- no math is involved!).  The weight is measured in tenths of a pound or 50 gram increments.

It's easy to use and easy to pack, as it weighs less than five ounces-- and the fifteen bucks you'll pay for it is nothing compared to the fifty bucks they'll charge you for an overweight bag!  [The only reason I've given this scale four stars, vice five, is that there are others on Amazon with more features for the same price.]

The only thing I had a problem with was the thin outer layer which can be easily ripped if caught in a sharp object but I did not take a star off though because that is expected for many types of child jackets.

One of the best fitting pairs of shoes/boots I own and worked flawlessly as a work boot first day on job.

positive,4.0,"These shoes are really comfortable to stand in, but the plastic coated strip up the top of the toes means they bend really oddly and rub on your toes when you run (or otherwise flex the toe box). I'm hoping that this is something that'll loosen up/break in over time, but the first few wearings have definitely made me aware of this flaw! It's not painful, per se, but it's just irritating enough that I think over multiple miles, it could end up ouchy.

The cushioning, however, is GREAT. I really appreciate Altra for making zero-drop running shoes that still have that ground-protection. I run mainly on asphalt and while I love my Nike Bionic Frees and New Balance Minimus Zeros for sprints and gym work, I like a little more padding between me and the gravel and concrete when I'm putting in the miles!

Aesthetic note: be aware that the colors are SUPER bright and, when combined with the wide toe-box, can remind you of clown shoes or bowling shoes. I don't find this a drawback, personally, but I understand why someone else might.","Stiff plastic on toe is a drawback, but otherwise awesomely cushioned zero-drop shoe"

positive,4.0,"I am going to start this off with the negative, I ordered the charcoal color to go with a shirt I had ordered. Well, these arrive and they are nothing like the picture on the screen, they are way lighter than what you see on the listing and it ended up not even matching with the shirt I wanted to wear them with.

Even though I cannot wear them for what I wanted they are still comfortable and fit me nicely. I am short so I figured they would not fit me how they should but they surprisingly did and that made me really happy. It is weird how far the top comes up and makes me look weird if I am wearing a short shirt. When they are pulled up like they are supposed to be the top of the leggings literally go up to my boobs and makes my backside look rather long. Fixing that is no big deal just wear a shirt that will cover it up.

I am pleased with these even though I had some problems I would still recommend these to others, Just know that the color you order may not be the color you get. I will attach pictures to show the color differences.

positive,5.0,I am a F and my daughter is an F-G. I bought bras for both of us. My daughter was leery at first because it looked like a corset top type of bra and she thought it would be uncomfortable for long term wear. I talked her into trying it and she and I both agree it is marvelous not to have deep cutting marks on our shoulders because of the proper support of the garment. It does not have stays so there is no nasty rubbing on the sides and the fabric breaths such that I don't mind wearing it even in the height of the Arizona summer.  I will say it is easier to get this on with help but that minor complication is well worth the lack of pain and wires that dig into your flesh. Even better it keeps you from looking slumpy like some of the bras for larger cup sizes do. It lifts and separates instead of just mashing it all down or to the side.,The most comfortable bra ever for those with larger cup sizes

positive,5.0,"These are good quality shoe trees that adapt to the internal dimensions of the shoe.  The construction is solid and the cedar smell is very pleasant.  I have gotten into the habit of putting these into my shoes after a long day's work and they do indeed help my thinner leather shoes keep their shape.  They are also great for working with the shoes while polishing them.  The great thing about these particular trees is the adaptable toe for fitting into a variety of shoe styles, and the whole heel with handle for easy grip while using them or polishing your shoes.  If you have spent a lot of money on shoes and want to keep them fresh, then these are the go-to shoe trees.  Make sure you get the right size for the shoes they will be used with.  They should be firm in the shoe but not stretching out the leather but not too loose to make good contact with the leather.
UPDATE: Having now tried several brands of cedar shoe trees, I recommend these most highly due to the full heal construction, which puts even pressure across the heal and maintains the most natural shape.  Others with a smaller heal seem to distort the shape.",Quality Item

positive,5.0,"I can't recommend these shoes enough.  I have moderately wide feet and even though the Echelon 5 currently does not come in a wide size, they fit like a dream.  At first I was hesitant to even try them on, because I am used to wearing a much slimmer looking old school sneaker, like an Onitsuke Tiger or an Asics and I usually will only wear something severe in a colour that is mostly black or charcoal.  Admittedly, I'm a sneaker snob and in the past have cared more about how the sneaker looked than whether or not it was most the comfortable choice for me!  I went to meet with a foot specialist who analyzed my gait in a very high tech way.  She filmed me walking on a treadmill barefoot and then again with many different sneakers.  Even though I initially refused to even try this shoe on as I kept telling her that the toe from above looked like a duck billed platypus, I eventually after much coaxing put it on my foot.  All I can say is WOW.  I felt like Cinderella finding her shoe.  It fit like a dream.  All my horrible foot aches have been significantly diminished now that I am wearing the right sneaker for me.  I had started to experience numb toes and quite a bit of pain in the ball of my foot.  I no longer have the numbness that I had from all my Nikes and the ball of the foot pain is a lot less.  I need to tell you what qualities I look for in a sneaker that are encompassed by this one.  I like sneakers that are light weight, breathable, comfortable and have a cushiony marshmallow-like feel.  (My feet are always hot, so I won't even try something on that has too much insulation.) This shoe has all of of those qualities and more since they actually look really great on and believe it or not, I've received many compliments on them.  I wish they came in other colours, but fortunately the current charcoal and pink combination is quite chic and I literally won't take it off my foot.  I have so many other sneakers, but I only want to wear this one now.",All I can say is WOW!
positive,5.0,"I received such amazing compliments for this top at work! Free, float, loose and breathable, you'll ffel scandalous like you're hardly wearing a thing. The layers are great, and doesn't require any additional under layers. I'm definitely getting a different color!  Remember to size up for the flowy feel!

I'm 5'3, 160lbs,  and a large fit perfect. It's even a bit loose where it sits on the waist/hip.","Beautiful and airy, perfect for the office!"
positive,4.0,Length is a little shorter than expected.,Four Stars
positive,4.0,"This is a really cute shoe, but it is a tad bit snug.  If you are not wearing it on a daily basis to break it in when you do put it on it will take a minute for your foot to conform to the snugness.  I would suggest a size larger than you normally wear, but otherwise this is a great looking shoe.  I get lots of compliments when I wear it.",Jambu Loafer
positive,4.0,"Where do I begin about these awesome shoes. Yes I used the word awesome to describe these shoes and I'll tell you why. And if you're like me you'll understand why. All my life I've always have had issues with finding shoes that fit my foot properly overall. Many times I would find shoes that were long enough but not wide enough, or wide enough but not long enough, or to high of an arch and wide and the list goes on. I wear size 10 and I have what I describe as flat wide duck feet. So as a woman with above average big feet it is already difficult but when you add flat and wide to the equation it makes finding and fitting hiking shoes a true task and I'm lucky if they're cute and not bulky.
So I recently started a weight loss lifestyle change of trying to get healthy, so my friend suggested hiking. And another friend suggested the Salomon brand when I mentioned to him about wanting to go hiking, who was an avid hiker.
And after searching through colors and looks and reviews I settled on these shoes in a size 10.

PROS:
Comfortable
Supports foot
Roomy enough space to wiggle toes
Stylish
Great for hiking or climbing stairs
Last all day
Protect feet very well

CONS:
There are none silly, these shoes are amaze-balls

OVERALL:
This is a person who avoids wearing shoes just because they are so comfortable, but these shoes have change my mind, I went hiking, and conquer and survived going up 287 difficult stone stairs in these shoes, they provided the support I need and protected from feet, because there were  a couple of stairs I stubbed my foot on and didn't feel anything. These shoes were made for hiking not to mention the price is a steal compare to the store website.","Best shoes for wide flat feet, very supportive of feet"

positive,5.0,"If you're a frequent traveler, or a ""must do it all in a carry-on"" traveler, these are a must. They go beyond just organizing your suitcase, they actually compress the contents so you can fit even more in it.

Here's what I am able to fit in each.

Small Square 1:
- Full weeks worth of undergarments + a pair of pajamas (rolled)

Small Square 2:
- Bag of chargers
- Mini first aid bag (a few bandaids, aspirin, vitamins)
- Travel candle (makes hotel living slightly more appealing)

Skinny Rectangle:
- 1 pair of heels + 1 pair of flats (stacked on top of each other)

Large 1:
- 3 pairs of pants
- 1 blazer
- 1 sweater
- 1 gym outfit

Large 2:
- 5-7 tops of varying weights / thicknesses
- scarf
- small jewelry roll + clutch

positive,5.0,"I bought my first pair of asics a few weeks ago and loved them, so came back to Amazon looking for a deal on similar.  Found this pair ""4E"" shoes on deep discount. I know I have wide feet, but I was skeptical about the 4E being too wide.  So I read up what Asics had to say about it, which was that the actual width may only vary by a milimeter or a few.  When I got these, I compared them to the ""normal"" pair I already had, and holding them tread to tread against each other, I could not see that the 4E was any wider at all.

For me this was great news because I wasn't really looking for a lot wider. So the information to share is this .. the ""wide"" actually comes more in the form of the cloth-like materials above the tread base.  I have very high arches, and on the ""normal"" shoes, the tongue bulges out and laces look liek they are covering a big gap.  On these 4E shoes, the shoes look normal, like they fit!  I now feel educated about what wide really means ... I will definitely be back for more!","... first pair of asics a few weeks ago and loved them, so came back to Amazon looking for ..."

positive,4.0,"It's a really nice leather wallet.  It has a lot of capacity. 7 credit card slots and a removable ID card case.  It is a bit thick though, which is understandable due to it's large capacity.  The leather is smooth and the stitching seems well made.  It's definitely a nice wallet, especially for the price.  I honestly was not expecting something this nice  I have purchased other wallets for more money, and this is just as nice as the expensive wallets.
***Update** My husband does tend to pack his wallets tightly, but his wallets usually last a year or more.  This wallet seems to have started to come apart a bit at the bottom.  Not bad, but almost like there was a small portion where the stitch was missing or is coming off.

I received a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",Nice wallet
positive,5.0,"Dress arrived on time, as promised , and it's gorgeous! I love the material - very soft and heavy, so it falls nicely, hugs curves, and is not completely see through. These run a bit large, but I expected this from other reviews, so order mindfully. I am 5'6"" 125 with a slim build and the small is just right. Even at my height, though, it is long and touches the ground, so if you're any shorter be prepared to have this dress tailored or get some sweet matching heels. I think it's totally worth it, though, as this dress feels like a 100 dollar dress rather than less than half the price I paid for it. Thanks PattyB, for yet another win!","Fits well, very flattering, LONG!"
positive,4.0,"My boyfriend absolutely LOVES this ring. The design is so awesome and intricate. I gave it 4 stars because it's not exactly scratch resistant.. My boyfriend scraped it really bad after the first time going to the gym and picking up weights so as a result, he takes his ring off every time he's at the gym. Also, go half a size smaller than you expect. The overly smooth surface makes it really easy to slip off when in contact with water. It's pretty inconvenient that not only does my boyfriend have to take it off at the gym, but now also when he washes his hands or takes a shower just so he doesn't lose it. He doesn't complain though and says he wants his wedding ring to be modeled after this exact ring. He's happy; that's what counts most I suppose.",Not scratch resistant..

It is surprisingly soft, and it is a lot like have a warm blanket that is cuddling you while you wear it, but light and warm. The pockets are lined too, so it is great to keep your hands warm, or you can just pull your hands into the sleeves. It may be a men's cut jacket, and I am sure it is not that flattering if I were to zip it up, but it does what I wanted it to do most of all, keep me warm at work, where it is cold, windy, and sometimes a bit wet.

After drying off the bandana with a towel, wear it around your neck. The material is thin enough to work well, but eventually body heat will warm up the necklace, so turn it over. I don't recommend refrigerating or freezing these or any of these types of cooling agents (the kind wrapped in material). They tend to feel slimy after beng refrigerated re condensation, maybe.

positive,5.0,"Ok, so I have odd feet: wide in front, very narrow in back, R a whole size bigger than L.  Looking for shoes that did not look like 'sneakers'; since that is all my feet can tolerate-I need a R toe fusion at this point and have an arch issue on that side. So sneakers have been my only option. Any shoes I can find; I walk right out of with my very narrow heels; or they crunch my toes! This shoe: very surprised! So light, not much arch support looking at them out of the box!  Put them on my feet: did not walk out of them, they are cushy; but not as much as expected; but that's ok! I have finally found a more 'moc' looking-sneaker type shoe that actually looks 'girly'! Thank goodness for this shoe! I had ordered the 9's first; because that is what my R foot now is; but the 9's were too big; went with the 8.5's! I am so happy, I now have a sneaker that looks more like a cute shoe! Highly recommend this style of sneaker-shoe!  I also have the white cloth-type; I don't like the real bright colors. My husband says the white look like a nursing shoe; but I ignore that! Only issue I have with this shoe is that I got them to wear barefoot; and my feet do sweat a bit wearing them around the house. I have worn these on my treadmill; I am extremely surprised; with how light they are; that my feet feel better in these than my $140 Asics; which make my R foot hurt at the end of a workout!

very well. If you wear a vest on duty you will need a large. I like the front zippered pockets.",one of the best uniform shirts I have found

positive,5.0,I bought these for my son about two years ago and expected them to brake during the year and buy new ones next year. Well their going on their third year in great shape even through both my Daughter and Wife using them to run outside and they have bigger feet then my son. I will defiantly be buying new ones this year because his feet out grew them. I post a picture to show the wear after three years. He wears them all the time except in the snow of course.,Great Slides/sandles 100%
positive,5.0,"Love this bag!!!  Looks like a Brahmin bag at a fraction of the price.  The color is a fabulous , perfect deep red (not maroon red), craftsmanship is top notch, size is just right and overall it exceeded my expectation.  Knowing that it was so much cheaper than a Brahmin I expected it so be lacking is some minor ways but took a chance on it anyway because of the price and I was very pleasantly surprised.  It easily holds all my things, is not too heavy, comes with a shoulder strap that is long enough to use as cross-body and it is very eye-catching.

The cleat rubs a tiny bit when you walk, but not enough to impede movement appreciably. I would not recommend walking on them indoors on hardwood or anything, but for outside, they're very functional. They look good and fit well.

I bought it for traveling and for impromptu overnights--it became my de facto pool bag. I haven't weighed it, but all zipped up the added weight to my suitcase was negligible. Also the pink color grew on me. Rich and just a touch obnoxious, it is easy to keep your eye on, which is what I wanted.",Keep it with you for last minute needs
positive,4.0,"This costume is totally worth what I paid for it.  However, it's VERY cheap quality.  The boots are basically vinyl spats that cover your shoes.  The straps broke almost immediately, though and I had to staple it back together.  The shirt and pants are really thin synthetic material and not very cute.  I wore the accessories with a different pair of pants and hoodie.  Overall, thought this costume got lots of compliments once I doctored it up a bit.",Good for the money
positive,5.0,"My young teenage daughter flies out of some pretty busy airports and needed a good, sturdy, easy-to-wheel carry on. I got her this one in cranberry so that she could distinguish it easily from other peoples' bags, and because once I had gotten myself a spinner bag I realized they really are easier to work with in the airport. She loves it, and has had a couple of good flight experiences with it.

positive,4.0,"It is well built, and the best girdle I own. The others are both from Walmart though, and have eye and hook closures, which tend to come apart on stretched material. It compresses, and offers a smooth shape. I am 5'2"" 185 pounds and bought the medium, not because I am a medium, but because I want to be a medium. I am actually a size large, down from a size 2X last year. It did not make me a medium (if it did I would give it 10 billion stars). I tried on my size large Halloween costume without this on last night and with it on tonight, and really don't see a difference. I think because my stomach hangs a bit normally, and this pushes it up, and thus out, there just isn't a benefit to my profile while wearing it. I like the compression, but in my case with my body type there is no benefit to my profile while wearing this. Well made for what it is. Was difficult to put on, but then again I should really be in the large or even extra large size.","Well made, but not sure how helpful it really is."

Nice and relaxed fit without being too boxy, and the sleeves (which I was afraid might be too 'blousy'/'peasanty') look good.

positive,4.0,"Ordered two different Patterns:
1. Vintage Rust - Ordered a Small by mistake.  I'm 5'8.5, 167 pounds, usual size pants 10.  These actually fit!  A little lower in the waist than I'd like - was hoping for above the belly button but hit just below. The fabric is extremely stretchy and buttery soft, like Lularoe.  Other reviewers mentioned loose in the waist - these are, because the material is so stretchy.  So no dancing in these pants, but great for around town - LOVE the print.

2. Boho Mix Indigo - Size Medium. Woah, totally different fabric.  Stiffer, rougher, not so much stretch, tight in the legs.  Given the lack of stretch and how inexpensive these are, I imagine the seams would rip easily.  Hope to exchange for a Large, though I've heard returns can be tough.  Love the print.

positive,5.0,"I have a terrible time finding tennis shoes that fit my narrow foot. I even went to a New Balance store thinking they would have something, but nothing worked there either. I love these shoes. They are so comfortable and look great. Finally I can wear comfortable shoes when I have a lot of walking to do. overtime I visited my son in CA I could never keep up with all the sightseeing because I never had good fitting shoes. Can't wait for my next vacation!","Finally, tennis shoes for narrow feet!"

positive,5.0,"Cant wait to try them hiking! The straps tend to get a little snug around my toe when i tighten them, but I think they just need a little adjusting and getting used to. The arch support is amazing, though. So far I just use them to take walks and do things around the house. Taking them camping as soon as I get the chance!","The arch support is amazing, though"

positive,4.0,"I have a 37"" waist and purchased a large which fits fine. Purchased for home wear only at my pool which is very private. I am too conservative to wear a speedo type suit in public. Wanted to maximize tan and not have a large suit that fills with air in pool and is slow to dry. I am pleased with this suit. Fits well, no drawstring which is not an issue. No bad or loose seams. Mine is black. It is not see through even when wet. I would prefer not to have the large label in front and it's not easily removed. No issues yet with sagging.
If you like me don't have a swimmers body with no fat then this type of suit will not enhance your appearance. Excellent value for the price and recommend.",Good Value!
