negative,2.0,"UPDATE: after 10 months and probably only 100 uses maximum (sunny CA after all), it has terminally failed. Button would not close and nothing worked. I am leery of ALL auto-opening umbrellas now. Two failures out of 2. The manual types never failed in this manner, giving years of service though I absolutely prefer automatic opening type.

I love these compact self-opening umbrellas. But my first one (another brand NOT this one!) broke.
This model has all the functionality I like and is distinctly more heavy-duty and better constructed than my first (good quality) umbrella.

When on the beach and touched with any water, they filled immediately with sand which then felt like walking in wet cement.

Great price, good color selection, not the quality I was looking for. Granted these are very inexpensive, I understand that. I did find one tie clip elsewhere for $8 and the finish was a mirror-like finish which what I was looking for. If that doesn't bother you, then maybe these are for you.",Not the quality I wanted.

negative,1.0,These where absolute garbage they hardly even stuck and feel complete off.,Garbage!
negative,1.0,this is really a pretty shoe... wish the quality was as nice as the appearance... 1st - there is no arch support... feels like you are walking bare foot. 2nd - the picture makes the shoe looks like it has a good sole..... this is more like a foam based sole and the shoe bends completely in half... this does not provide for good foot support. 3rd... this shoe is very loud when you walk.... and slippery... the best way i can describe it is to compare it to walking on sand that has been poured on tile. so very slippery and you get that loud sound.... don't know how to describe it better...4th - i can feel every pebble i step on.....i just can't do these shoes,this is really a pretty shoe.

I could have cut out cardboard, taped it together, sprinkled some glitter and made a comparable product. The bottoms of my feet are burning and I've walked in them minimally (again, had them on for less than 1 hour). I can feel the shoe rubbing the back of my left heel, assuredly a blister is forthcoming. I needed grey shoes and I got grey foot wraps with a thin cardboard bottom.

negative,1.0,These shoes are poorly made and with cheap materials. The front tab doesn't cover the Velcro strip unless there is NO foot in it( well a foot drawn on paper would fit). I don't know if it's a design flaw or a fluke in just this pair but I wouldn't buy again. We just got done traveling and I had ordered these for my husband for that purpose. I quickly purchased a pair at a local store since these would not work. I just found out I'm a day late and cannot get a refund or exchange. This is really to bad and my fault as I should have taken care of this right away. I had to pick 1-5 stars to review so the star is only for this reason.

I do not have unusually high arches but these boots are so narrow between the sole and the seam that runs across the top of the foot at the arch it's downright painful. I tried shoving a tennis ball and a can of soup in them to try and stretch it to no avail. Even with the thinnest of socks there was no way this would be comfortable. If I had to put any kind of arch support or orthotic in these shoes I doubt I could get more than just my toes through the arch seam. Doc's really needs to reconsider this design.

negative,2.0,"I am so disappointed that these didn't work out. I originally ordered my usual size 8. They ended up being too tight which I equate to postpartum body changes. So I returned them and ordered an 8 1/2 thinking that would be perfect. There is no way these are an 8 1/2, they're huge, at least a whole size bigger. I even measured my feet and though I measure closer to a 9, the 8 1/2 is still way too big. It's like they skipped right over the half size.
On top of that the box arrived crushed which in turn crushed the shoes (see pictures). If these fit I probably would have just dealt with the damage but since they don't, it only makes it worse.
I'm so so disappointed. The style of these shoes is amazing and they seemed comfortable enough to wear for an extended amount of time. The leather is decent quality and they seemed durable.

There is no way that this could be an extra large. There is also absolutely no padding or shaping for the bust, so unless you have small breasts, very firm breasts (or implants), you will be squashed into an unflattering shape.

negative,2.0,"I bought this bag because it looks pretty cool in the picture.  I figured depending on quality I would either use this for extensive traveling, or just a sack to throw a towel and various things in when I go to the beach or something.  It has proven to only be useful for the latter option.

Pros:
Looks cool in the picture, and my friends thought it looked cool and vintagey in person.

Cons:
Cheap cheap cheeaaaappp.  The main shoulder straps don't feel like they could handle any weight whatsoever.  All the pouches and flaps use a belt buckle style latch to hold them down.  I don't know how else to describe them but as cheap.  Like a belt on a toy soldier I guess.  Nothing would be secure in this bag at all.

The fit.  It fits horribly.  One of the things I like most about my slim profile laptop backpack is that it tends to hug your full back even full of books.  This bag however, feels like you're wearing a plastic shopping bag on your back with your arms through the handholds.

Unfortunately, after just one month of use, the upper soles of the flip flops (where feet touch them) have turned black.  They look disgusting!  I have tried every possible cleaning technique I can think of, to no avail.  I was able to lighten the black marks at the heel, but not at the ball or toe area.  I'm very disappointed at how they already look as if she's used them for years.  She doesn't run around outside barefoot, so I'm not even sure how they got such a dirty appearance.  I was never able to tell any problem with the pairs my older daughter has used, but I guess that's because they are black-bottomed and we can't tell.

Has the era of skinny jeans misled people so much that they think 32 waist is an XL?",Too Small
negative,1.0,"These tights are exactly that - tight - very tight in the hips, can barely get them on, and unbearable to wear. They are being returned. I ordered one size larger than I normally wear in tights (other brand) AND I ordered one size larger than what is recommended on the sizing chart posted here - ie. I normally wear 1X (stockings, pants, undies), but I ordered 3x-4x. I wanted to try a brand that had tights that were slightly larger, to see if they would accommodate my apple-shaped tummy better, without being too loose in the hips and legs.

Instead, with these tights the hip-area was way tighter than my normal brand size 1X. I have average-size legs and small hips for my size waist (since I am apple-shaped). The length of the tights is good (actually, generous, I'm 5'6""), the width around the legs is OK, the width around the waist is good, and the length of the crotch to waist is good. But the width of the hips is a total mistake by the manufacturer. I see some other reviewers have stated this problem as well.

Concerning the ""fleece"" question that comes up in the reviews: I already have fleece-tights in my other brand, and frankly, the fleece on those tights and the fleece on these tights are the same. The fleece is not as you expect at all, it's simply a thicker, tighter weave with some nap, so there's less ""gap"" for cold air to come through the weave. They feel and ARE warmer than the sweater-tights I also wear (again, size 1X, other brand). Plus the nap feels cozy for your leg, just as the ad states here.","Hips are way too small!

negative,1.0,"I consulted a New Balance representative via telephone before purchasing to ensure I would get the right fit and it would be a shoe that meets my needs, so, I am very surprised today at the disappointing results.

I said I wanted a synthetic shoe.  Where this shoe has been advertised as ""leather and synthetic,"" it is indeed all man-made materials. You can consult New Balance's Web page and see it there.

The other thing I specifically mentioned is I wanted a lot of support and cushioning, as an earlier 800 series shoe I once had offered but has since been discontinued.  I was assured this is the replacement of that model or at least a similar enough shoe to meet my needs.

So, I purchased via Amazon to save money, and had a 20 percent off one-time coupon and decided to buy 2 pairs.  It looks like both will be sent back for the following reasons:

1- The second I put them on, I noticed it was rubbing my large toes in the corner and after a few seconds was becoming painful.
2- There is a lack of support/cushioning with this shoe.  I felt like I was walking on two boards laced up.
3- While I was assured on the phone these walking shoes are recommended for those with orthopedic issues who need a walking shoe, it seems they will only worsen pain and discomfort while wearing them.

In my opinion, New Balance has gone downhill in the last four or five years.  I also find it inconvenient that they use so much mesh now, where they did not on some previous models.  The second it rains heavy outdoors, you have to get your feet soaked.  I'm guessing it saves them a few bucks to use mesh more than they once did.",Not What I Expected

They are definitely larger than standard size, but when wearing them with wool socks, they fit well. Too loose for me with regular socks.

I had to trade out in the insole, the arch was way forward. Not a typical issue for me. Once I did that, they got comfortable in about a week or so of light use.

They are comfortable for all day wear, but they are cheaply made. I used them as weekend winter boots and for travelling to and from work (not during the work day as I wanted to keep this pair looking decent). In the course of 4 months the shoe laces frayed quite a bit and a shoe lace hook broke. The toe leather cut up pretty easily too.

Unfortunately I experienced no results with this, even when I used it every night for several months. This led me to searching reviews online to see what others have experienced. I found out on Paula's Choice that this product contains so little glycolic acid that it's ineffective, and the pH is not in the range that would allow the acid to work properly on the skin even if there was enough of the acid. This explained why I was experiencing no results. The grapefruit and aloe vera in the product doesn't help my acne either (which one thinks it would), which makes me wonder if this product is simply 99% water. This is a large waste of money. When I use this, nothing happens and my skin is the same as when I don't use it. I still have the majority of the bottle and don't think I'll ever be able to finish it up because it's an unnecessary step that doesn't benefit my skin at all.

Battery started dying less then a month after I ordered it. No big deal, it happens. It shouldn't but it does. When I opened it up to replace the battery, the plastic bezel had been sliced almost all the way through. Returned and bought the same exact one. The watch is hard to read in the dark when the back light is on.

Update 3/2/18

Went to change the calendar today and the button you pull out to change the time and date broke. It snapped and pulled all the way out. Luckily Amazon gives a free 2 year warranty so it is getting fixed for free. While it didn't show up on the order details page, it did show up on the watches new purchase page. Funny enough, the warranty would have expired in 4 days. I started the warranty process today. I will update when I hear something back.

Update 3/23

Asurion called and said they were going to refund my purchase price as its to expensive to repair. So basically I got to wear the watch for free just short of two years. Would I but it again? Probably not. The watch never really worked right, and I had to send it back twice in 2 years. I bought for around $110 and its now $60. I think its still over priced based on my experiences.

I honestly don't understand how more people aren't bothered by it (and it has such a high rating, too), but the discomfort level is very high after a short walk. I tried cutting it off as others had mentioned, but that didn't solve the issue and only aggravated it since I couldn't get a clean, smooth, non-abrasive surface line in the back and is still cutting into my skin.

They are lighter than regular Danskos, which was always the gripe I had with Danskos.
They seem quite sturdy.
I haven't replaced the removal inserts with orthotics, and I don't think I am going to. They are quite comfortable the way they are.
The pattern is very pretty, but they probably vary pair-to-pair.

I am digging them.
Wish they weren't so expensive, but I will probably order another pair eventually.
Lastly, I am right at a 7.5/8 and the 38s fit great, with the expected little gap at the back that should be there.

UPDATE after ONE month of ownership:
The up side is that the shoes are more comfortable than ever. The bad news is that coating/layer that has the pattern is cracking/tearing. I only wear them to work and I haven't done anything crazy with them. However, I had my $35 Cherokee WorkWear shoes for YEARS before they started cracking. It looks like someone took a tiny razor blade to the shoe. I am pretty disappointed. They are supposed to be better quality. I could have ordered another pair of Cherokees and save $100. If there was a way to upload a photo, I would, but I don't really have the capability to upload an adequate video at this time. Maybe I'll get around to it one day soon. I would consider a return, but unfortunately, I am ONE day past the return period.

negative,2.0,"These are beautiful sandals.  I wear 8 1/2 and I ordered 8 since they didn't have half sizes.  Fit's fine!  9 would have been too big- and over time these type sandals loosen some anyway.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that they are not as comfortable to wear as last Vionics I got.  The arch is a bit to high, so my foot hurts after wearing them.  This is about my 4th pair of Orthaheels- vionic type sandals.  And this is 2nd pair that ARCH support is too high.  I need arch support- but it really DIGS into my arches- and who wants pain every time you wear?  But I can wear them for an hour or two ok, or much longer if not walking or standing a long time.  Hoping the stones stay in.  These are much prettier than my last pair, and looked great with a long sun dress I wore on Sunday afternoon.

I found that the wheels were ""off"" somehow.  Gliding this seemed WAY off, to the point of me just tilting it and carrying it on two wheels rather than using the 4 wheels.  In addition, the handle felt very flimsy when extended and often didn't lock into position.

I've purchased other pairs of Bed Stu boots before and that sizing was accurate. So just be careful when ordering.  Overall I am impressed by the look and feel of these boots. I highly recommend. I actually bought them in both colors. Both have a worn in distressed look which I like. It's also important to mention that the black boots are not a true black as shown in the picture.

I probably should have deleted most of my previous review. I posted a picture of my actual boot in the photo section of this page.

negative,2.0,"I want to like these boots, especially because the grey color was only $50 when I bought them. But there are a few things I'm not thrilled about. Most troublesome, the soles do NOT last. After one season of wear, the ""wood"" patterned fabric or whatever it is around the sides of the heel is peeling off and the sole is wearing through to white plastic underneath. I'm going to try to get them repaired, because the leather upper seems to be of good quality. But the soles are not great. For that reason, I would not pay more than $50.

Style-wise, I love the oxford/wing tip look. They are a bit pointy, so they make my feet appear longer. But I am only a size 7 and I don't mind THAT much if my feet look a little bigger--but if this is a concern for you, you may not like the look of these.

Fit wise, they run narrow and tight across the top. My heels are narrower and my ankles are thin, so I actually really like that my feet don't slide around in these. My feet are wider at the toes, but I found that the leather has stretched a bit with wear to accommodate this.",Pros and Cons

negative,2.0,"I decided to write this review because I have begun to notice that the waterproofing on Columbia shoes (that are built similar to this design) lose their water proofing layer rather quickly. This is my 4th pair of Columbia's, and I really like the design of the shoe, as well as how well they fit and feel right out of the box. The issue I have with them is that after about 4 or 5 months of continuous use the waterproofing starts to go (usually at the toe due to the flexing). This is a consistent issue and bothers me quite a bit. I believe it may be due time for me to spend a little more money again on some goretex fabric shoes, as my experience with a previous pair of Solomon GTXs went well (2 years before the shoes began to absorb water). The waterproofing with goretex seems to outlast these generic ""waterproof"" shoes by a marginal amount, and I do not enjoy spending money on something that must be replaced more often than should be. This being said I do realize that nothing lasts forever, but the waterproofing could at least last a year at the minimum? I do not think I am asking for much.",Columbia's shoes could use some improvement

I bought this as an undervest, and despite going up a size (based on other reviews) it's still pretty tight - OK for the purpose I have, probably not for wearing just as a t-shirt.

However, for some reason the t-shirt has a really off-putting smell not unlike burning plastic. Strongly chemical, very unpleasant industrial smell.

Being synthetic fabrics, I wouldn't expect rust-colored dots (on the front right leg) after the first machine washing, but that's what I got.

HOWEVER the black rinse has an awful chemical smell to it.  I had read reviews before purchasing them and found that other people had the same problem.  I figured I'd try them out anyway.  I've washed them countless times and the smell won't go away.  I've let my friends smell them straight out of the wash and they've also smelled it.

Somebody else in the reviews says they got the smell out by soaking them in vinegar, so maybe I'll try that.

They came in a HUGE envelope mailer, each earring wrapped in a little plastic pouch.  The envelope was pretty battered, like it had gotten stuck in a sort machine.
One earring looked like the picture.  The other - the silver was bent in HALF - as in, the back clasp was standing up straight, but the entire 'fishhook' part that should be hanging in your ear was bent over to touch the stone attachment.  Additionally....the stone wasn't even attached to the earring - the bailing ring was broken in two.  Mind you, they were both broken INSIDE of their little ""securely wrapped"" package.
I did attempt once to straighten the bent earring portion, and the ""silver"" snapped in my hands.  I took the earrings with me to my jeweler (I was already there to get my watch tuned up ), and after careful inspection, he stated that these are NOT ""sterling"" silver as advertised, but rather silver-plated over a base metal.

negative,2.0,"Wanted to love this, but found it awkwardly cut, with a strangle little flare at hips that doesn't show in picture. Refer to other 2-star reviews, which also explain this. The material is very thick and stiff, and if you're familiar with carhartt jeans, you probably know to expect this. I've had carhartt jeans of the same fabric and construction, and they do not soften or unstiffen over time, no matter how many washings. This would be an advantage if you're planning to use these clothes as tough work-clothes, but for regular wear, they are much too stiff. The vest's collar is especially unfortunate: it hits you in the neck or jawline. The assembly and features are very good, though: good, tough interior pockets and a nice panel behind the zipper that keeps the wind out. If you want something brawny, this might be for you.

What was really unusual is that my foot didn't sit in the shoe correctly and it felt lopsided.  I don't know if it was the way the shoes are made or my feet, but this is the only pair of shoes I have ever bought that felt so odd.  I had to return them.",Disappointed
negative,2.0,"These seem lovely, except they are too tight, and I will either have to pay 50% of the cost of purchase simply to ship them back, or travel inconveniently out of my way to return them :(  So I will simply have to donate them, which is frustrating.

I followed the advice and a number of reviewers, and ordered 2 sizes below my regular shoe size; I discovered I should have only gone down 1 1/2 sizes - so be forewarned, you may need to go down 1 1/5-2 sizes down, and the cost to return them may almost be as much as the price of the shoes themselves.

The 2 stars are not for the quality of the shoe - they seem fine enough, but rather for the confusing measurements and inability to return in a reasonable manner.  Amazon will only take a return via UPS, and I could drop these in first class mail for next to nothing, so it just adds to the frustration.  Until now I'd been a big fan of Amazon.  Today, I'm not so sure - I learned that shoes may not be something to purchase through a service such as amazon.  I encourage you to consider outside retailers, perhaps those specializing in dance-wear, who can perhaps better direct you in terms of size.

negative,1.0,"Review as of 24 June 2015;
My Son spent his hard earned money on this necklace as my Mother's day gift because we THOUGHT it was sterling silver, like they claim it to be. Beware that this is, in fact, NOT STERLING SILVER! The photo shows the proof of that. Stealing silver does NOT wear off exposing copper metal beneath!
And never mind that the chain broke, which is what brought to my attention to the fact that he had, or rather WE have, been duped and ripped off!
This is just completely wrong. People who sell things under false pretenses, who outright lie about the product they're selling and have the nerve to charge these kind of prices for carnival-junk jewelry should be ashamed of themselves! At the very least the purchase price should be returned or a replacement sent!!

UPDATE: 17 November 2016:
 I was never contacted by anyone concerned with the sale of this necklace concerning the problem; which means:  After 17 months, I'm left to believe that my Son wasted his time and money since there has never been any type of a resolution with the necklace, other than being ignored and hoping it would be forgotten about.
This is very sad indeed because in the Sellers photo it looked so very beautiful and represented something precious for me. I wore it exclusively until the chain broke and I found that the silver plating had worn off exposing the copper underneath. Now I have nothing but this review and a photo of something I'd hope to have and wear forever. Pathetic as that sounds, it's still the truth.
As you can tell; I won't be buying nor recommending this item or Seller to anyone ---not after this fiasco! Due to the lack of regard in this problem from all concerned with the sale of this necklace.......

negative,2.0,"I loved the idea of these pajamas--I had super hero pajamas as a kid and remember whooping it up in them. However, the design of these Komar pajama sets leaves a lot to be desired.

The biggest problem is that they are VERY tight. My little boy is a string-bean and not at all thick through his limbs but these fit almost as tight as, well, tights. They're hard to get over his hands, especially if he's a bit damp from a bath.

The second problem is that though they're listed as ""100% cotton"" they don't feel like cotton. More like a cotton / polyester blend that's a bit scratchy. Not ideal for sleep wear.

That said, my son still loves them because they're Batman and Superman; he cares a lot less about fit and comfort than his Dad.

However, these jeans are the least durable jeans I have ever owned.  They started developing holes where the fabric stretches.  I have worn this pair 8-10 times and there are already 2 holes and they are not the result of cutting, tearing, or abrasion.  The threads in the fabric just broke causing the surrounding threads to come unwoven.  Looking at the holes, the threads are extremely thin - almost like a t-shirt.

Unfortunately, I put them on this morning and the vinyl began to crack at the ball of my foot and continued to crack so now they are totally unusable. Returns are no longer possible because outside the window, which is unfortunate for a product that one only uses occasionally.  So after a few uses, they are totally useless!

negative,1.0,"This is Ralph's wife.  The bottom was a review written around the time that I bought these.  I treated the leather with oils and moisture protectants, but the next season I tried them on and they'd shrunk.  My feet still measure the same.  I threw them out.  I have had no luck with any Clark shoe or boot.  They never have arch supports of any mention.  The shoes I'd bought had had stitching and the knots were tied on the inside, which irritated my feet over time.  There were two pair of shoes like this.  I will never purchase Clarks again and think they are way overpriced for what you get.

Please remember I purchased these on size up so my arch supports fit in them.  After one season they were too tight even without those arch supports.

When I purchased this boot it was said to be waterproof and I believe it is.  This boot has room around the top for thick socks or a light slack to be stuffed in if need be.  The sole is rugged and good for snow.  The zipper starts down low to allow your foot to slip in more easily.  My one caveat, the reason why I did not give it five stars, is that once your foot is in there is not adequate cushioning inside and virtually no arch support.  I solved this problem by going up one full size and inserting one of the new Dr. Scholl's Active Series Replacement Insoles.  This boot is now amazingly comfortable.  I don't know if all women go through this, but I try on a lot of shoes or boots, usually, before I can find a pair that I'm happy with.  I am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend them.","They are waterproof, I am told."

negative,2.0,"My wife purchased this for me as a birthday present at Macy's last February for around $150.00 so that I would have a nice leather bag to carry my notebook around in.

Although this was a nice looking bag new, with age the leather finish has faded and has developed small speckled spots in the black leather, most likely a result of a poor tanning process and cheap dye job.

It has never been abused or left in a car or in direct sunlight, and just developed those defects as it aged.

It is not really a bag for a laptop or a notebook. The description in the paperwork that came with the bag stated that it will hold up to a 15"" laptop, but this bag really has no padding to protect one. If you're looking for a bag to haul your laptop or notebook around in, it was a nice bag when new, but it failed to keep that attractive look and looks lumpy now after just two uses.

Pros . . .
The leather was nice and soft when received.

Cons . . .
Not really designed to protect either notebooks or laptops.
The carrying strap is braded nylon, not leather.
The black dye fades, white spots, almost like mold, developed in the leather, and the leather scuffs very easily.
The inside compartment spaces are too small for some items that are supposed to fit in them.
The front flap is secured by magnets and not a zipper, and doesn't hold the flap closed very well.
It's too small for most laptops and some notebooks, and is poorly designed and constructed.

Yes, they say right in the title that these socks have NON-elastic tops, but I still didn't expect them to fall down to my ankles all the time. I have slightly larger than average calfs, and because these are long enough to rise to mid-calf level, I figured they'd stay in place, but no. So if you're wearing them as dress socks and you're sitting down with your legs crossed, your pants will naturally rise a few inches and show everybody that your socks are crumpled around your ankles. Not a good look.

Plus, they're very thin, so they provide no warmth, comfort or cushion. Most ribbed dress socks are the same, but at least the other thin dress socks I own don't fall down to my ankles. I often buy black dress socks with a thicker feel and more cushion, which can double as casual socks with jeans, but I do often wear thin, ribbed dress socks with slacks or a suit.

If I had looked carefully at the picture before buying I would have noted that there are only 3 spots to store a credit card and  In this day of store cards there is no extra card spots to keep them.

The only manufacturing problem is that all the slots and paper bill site are very tight and difficult to slide cards and money into.

Okay, so I could have gotten past the color difference, BUT when I put these shoes on my feet the balls up to my toes turned numb within no more than 10 minutes of putting them on!!!  The shoe seems to fit just fine.  I'm an 8.5 in every shoe I wear & these were an 8.5 & felt just fine, until the numbing of my feet!  I don't have wide feet either, pretty slender actually.  I've never had this experience with any other shoe in almost 40 years of wearing shoes.  What a bummer!  I took the shoes off, the numbness goes away, I put the shoes on & the numbness returns.  Needless to say I am returning these shoes.  I really like the way the Asics look so I'm going to try a pair of those.

The notch on the post is worthless: that is usually where the backing rests, but it is too far back on these posts and it doesn't stop the backing from coming off if the earring catches on something (that has happened to me).

I checked the dress sizes, I ordered a little large so I could take them in if need be, the Large was for a Med. sized lady, and barley fit, the XL was for a large chested lady (my sister) and didn't fit even a med. sized lady (me) I would NOT recommend this dress to anyone!","Save your money, find another dress!"

Also one of them had a hard spot that made it even more uncomfortable.  At least I was able to return them for a full refund- thanks, Amazon.

negative,2.0,"I have owned this bag and the smaller version of it at least 7 or 8 times.  I bought the small version to downsize what I carried around everyday to the bare minimum and then switched to this larger version to be able to carry a bit more without weighing myself down.  The multiple pockets, compartments, zippered, mesh for visibility, hidden pockets to discretely carry feminine items and most of all the easily accessible cell phone holder  was and is ideal for me.  I'd carry these bags for years until I wore them out through much wear and tear.  Completely reasonable amount of use for a non-leather bag.  I'd just pop on Amazon and get another one.  Women stopped me on the street to ask about the bag.  I loved it...until last year when the quality changed. I wonder if Travelon was sold or has switched to a cheaper manufacturer.  The nylon used for the bag is stiffer and less pliable than it was, the strap is a little flimsier, the zippers are of lower quality and the magnetic fasteners are cheaper and don't hold as well.  The velcro fastener that holds the cell phone ripped off.  I sewed it back on.  I bought a brown version of the bag earlier this year -- the zipper on the front pocket broke - I actually sewed it back together which held for a while but then became unusable.  No problem.  Ordered a black version.  Received it on Oct. 24.  As of today, Dec. 8, the strap has completely detached from the cell phone holder.  It is literally held on by two threads and I'm in danger of the bag falling of my shoulder.  I just spent hours searching hundreds of bags for a replacement and let me tell you there is no replacement that will be as convenient and affordably priced as this bag.  I finally settled on the Tumi Voyageur Lugano Messenger which is much much more expensive and still not as good as the Travelon.  I am writing this review both as a warning to others and a plea to Travelon, please go back to your other manufacturer.  This bag is one of a kind and its a shame for it to be in the state its in now.",Bring Back the Travelon I Used to Love and Could Count On

negative,2.0,"I'm a fan of NYDJ jeans and have this same Ami style in a 16W in their Sure Stretch fabric and they're big on me. So I purchased these in a 16 thinking they would fit - I'm currently trying to lose several sizes after a surprise, VERY late in life pregnancy (happiest surprise ever and my daughter is perfect but it did a real number on my body! Ha ha!) so I'm wearing a 16 or 18 in most brands now. The NYDJ Ami Super Skinny pair I have in a 16W are the comfiest jeans I've ever owned in my entire life, and super chic looking! These, however, didn't fit me at all. I literally couldn't get them pulled up past my knees! Huh? Even if these are a size too small you'd think I could get them pulled up over my calves. I have zero shame so I'd admit it if I had big calves. I don't. I've got plenty of pairs of too small jeans (pre-pregnancy I'm a size 12) and I can get even the skinniest of those on that far! I'm dealing w/ pregnancy weight gain so it's almost all in my belly w/ some in the hips and backside. Honestly, I'd exchange these for an 18 but I'm too freaked out by the calf issue!
Aside from the crazy fit issue, these look cute. Lovely, durable NYDJ fabric and quality. Since I can't get them on I can't comment on cut or fit, aside from what I've said already.
Bottom line: if you're wearing a ""plus size"" or are curvy, or have muscular calves these might not be a great choice for you. However, the NYDJ Ami Super Skinny style in a plus size (meaning their W size range) in the Sure Stretch fabric are absolutely fantastic!  Best. Jeans. Ever. And DO size down with those.

I should have gone with my instinct..  Russells are a wonderful brand and don't shrink (at least the light grey) my older charcoal sweats seems to be a thinner fabric.

They may not look the best or like the most expensive, but they always worked great.

So, the watch arrived today, in a box, just not, its box lol. If you're gonna send something new in a box, it should probably be the box that its supposed to come in and not one from another product. Not that theres some huge difference in boxes but it negates the entire reason of stating that its a new product in box or with box. See photos.

Now from Kinda bad to worse. Unless Im missing something and all of my other watches were broken, I thought the day should change when the watch hits 12AM or right around there. Not 2:39AM like this one does. The day of the month works correctly and turns over at 12AM, but the week day, nope, 2:39 in the morning. WTH??

negative,1.0,"I thought how could you go wrong with 270 plus positive reviews but shoes are probably the most difficult thing to review because hardly anyone has the same foot or preferences. And they really need to fit well and feel good or they can ruin what should be a good time. Shoes are one thing you shouldn't buy just for the price.

I bought these for hiking but as soon as I put them on I knew I'd be in trouble after a day out in these. While the fit is great (it's very hard to find boots that come wide) there is hardly any cushion inside - anywhere. They just did not feel comfortable. I prefer to wear thin socks so that doesn't make up the lack of comfort. The lining even feels rough. But the worst is the seam that hits right at the ball of my ankle. Scrape, scrape, scrape, that's all I could feel. Imagine several hours of that. I also didn't notice any arch support at all.

Based on other reviews it also seems that the quality is not consistent. I don't think that was the problem with mine, they just don't work with my feet.",Shoes are too unique for a review

I sent them back and ordered two in SMALL.  Small fit better at the waist but the overall cut made them too small, so those go back as well.

This is a different brand, so gave it the benefit of the doubt. So far so good, zipper is holding up nicely.
Unfortunately, the big downside is the credit card slots are too tight, according to hubby. I noticed he's keeping his credit cards in the coin purse, and he said it's because the slots are too tight and he doesn't want to be wrestling getting his cards in and out in the hope that frequent use might loosen up those slots.

I'm a size 9 and relatively high arches, but the straps are never snug on purchase.  Further, and worst of all, I have NEVER had a pair of Rocket Dogs NOT come apart at the strap.  They are evidently (that is, all of my evidence reports) NOT constructed with much depth nor strength at strap connection points.

Navy is same color as tile, not same color as picure. Much darker than image. For that reason, 4 stars. It is however very comfortable and what I was looking for, hard to beat for the price!

It does shrink if you wash it though, cold or not. I couldn't seem to get it right again so thats a bit of a let down but you get what you pay for. Simply due to quality I give 3 stars.

It got returned immediately.",Wasn't long enough...
negative,1.0,"Fundamental problem with this shoe is not obvious.  I tried the shoe out for 20 seconds and my socks were coated with an invisible slimy coating and it made the carpet area slimy.  I used my slippers to step on the affected area just once and my slippers were slippery for the whole night.
- on the bottom of the shoe is stated ""chemical resistant"" and thus the manufacturer might have added chemical coating to make the shoe resistant to chemical and to keep the rubber soft.
- sole is too soft.  I don't like it but it is OK.

On the plus side, the shoe is decent as decent men's rain boots are so hard to find.  This rain boot had a high enough heel and it seems like it would last several years of use.

Personally, I don't like this shoe due to the invisible coating and the gel like/squishy sole.",Weird invisible coating kills the shoe
negative,2.0,"I wish I could say I love these shoes. The looks are fantastic, reminds me of mountaineering boots / oldschool hiking style. The materials seem decent, the outsole grips nicely. They really just look amazing. But that's where it ends.
This shoe has one major flaw. It's the padding around the toe box. I'm sure you have read the many negative comments by now, talking about the width of the toe box and how narrow it is. My feet are by no means big or wide, I wear one of the smallest sizes and having ordered the wide width shoe, I'm barely scraping by. I tried 3 different sizes with this shoe. The wide model just ups the size of the overall shoe, the toe box seems maybe only slightly larger, if at all. I wonder who this shoe is designed for? Children with large feet? However, I figured out it's not so much the width of the toe box as everybody says, it's the padding. There is some sort of sewn in cloth lip around the edges of the toe box. I get the idea behind it- you wouldn't want to feel the actual steel toe digging into your feet, I get it. But the ""lip"" is not padded. No, that would feel great. They have cheaped out and thrown in literally just that- a cloth lip. The material is sharp. It feels bunched up. It presses and rubs HARD on the side of your toes on either side of the shoe. It's as if you left a piece of the stuffing paper from the store. It also essentially decreases the width of the toe box. It's stupid.

The quality is nothing to write home about. They are cheaply thrown together. Things like ripped threads, spots of glue here and there. Somebody also sewed in the wrong size tag, which was then ""fixed"" by gluing on the right one. Little things. For the price, they should be made at least a little better than that. These are not office flats. They are work boots, the whole idea behind product as such is comfort and durability.",Disappointed

negative,2.0,"I am not super impressed. After all of the great reviews I expected a fine slim profile wallet. This one is constructed with quality metal like they advertise, but functionally it has a lot to to be desired.

First off, unless you did your homework and actually researched how much stuff (cards) you can fit in here, you may be disappointed. I have 10 in it and it's not maxed out, but it's close. I believe they said 14 is the max. If you max it out, it will tear up your cards.

Secondly, if it is not full (see above), you have to stretch the Velcro very tightly to prevent the cards from falling out. There is nothing over the open side where the cards go in and out to keep them from falling out. Other models of Trayvax wallets have a piece of leather with a snap, or elastic, but this one has nothing on the bottle opener side. Only pressure holds your cards in.

Third, It's great to be able to open a beer in any situation, but I'm not sure that you need this ability with your wallet. If you do, it'll be once in a blue moon. Alternatively, on a daily basis, the bottle opener will snag your clothes, poke your fingers or get you into an unnecessary conversation at the airport.

Fourth, the bottom of the wallet does have parachute cord to keep your cards from falling out through the bottom, but why not just have it looped like it is on the sides? Instead it has a useless plastic thing that pokes your butt when you sit on it.

If I could do it over again, I'd shell out the extra cash and get the leather one. This one may work for some people, but it's not what I want. It feels awkward and uncomfortable.","Excellent concept, poor execution"

This is probably the biggest Extra Small anything I have ever seen and is way too loose for the Kelty pack.

It's very tall, much taller than my old wallet which was just a bit taller than credit cards.  If the cards were arranged horizontally this would not be so bad because they would be staggered and distribute the thickness of the credit cards. But the way it is, the credit cards all stack on each other and take away an advantage of being taller.  The increased height really serves no purpose at all.

I'd like to say though that this wasn't a flaw in advertising.  I had the pictures in front of me, the measurements were there, the design, etc.  I just liked it a lot more in picture form than actually in hand.

negative,2.0,"I thought these would be nicer than they are... The fabric is OK. Mediocre stretchy satin that shrinks a bit after you wash them. It's more like what a slip would be made of rather than a camisole. My main problem with these is that you have to wear a bra with skinny, low straps to have it work at all. If you are bigger in the bust (I was a size D to DD while using these) then they won't hardly work at all. Bras for larger sizes seem to have cups that go up higher on the strap for more coverage, so your strap doesn't start for quite a ways up, closer to your shoulder, not below your underarm. Because of this, where you clip the Cami Secret makes it practically up at your neck and too short to cover anything, and they are too narrow to cover anything more than a V-neck. So even if you are small-chested and use these, they won't work if you have a boatneck top. They are only about 5 inches wide at the top part, and they get narrower as they go down.
In theory, these are a great idea. But until they make them with bigger clips so I can use them on a bra with a strap wider than 3/4"", or they make them work for full-figure bras, I'm going to have to come up with a different solution. In all honesty, it was more comfortable to just wear a real cami than fight with these things all day.",You have to have the right bra...

negative,2.0,"First of all, I don't know why people keep saying the shoes fit smaller and such, when on the contrary I think Skechers have changed their sizing of their shoes in the newer ones. I had been wearing Skechers Go Run 2 ever since I bought them early last year. I wore size 7.5 in Go Run 2, which fit like a charm and were extremely comfortable. So I stick with the same size when I bought Go Run 3. They felt so big, but since the ""roomier toe area"" feature seems to be emphasized in this newer version, I thought that was just what it was. Plus I got the limited edition color one (the mint-pink color) which I adored. So I took them for my walk and run for 2 days, and I ended up getting runner's toe and also pulled my hamstring during my attempt to ""break into"" the new shoes. Also the back side of the shoes kept rubbing the back of my ankle since it's made of harder material than Go Run 2 or Go Run 3 Ride - but this issue could be due to the incorrect fitting. Since I bought them online and had worn them outside, I couldn't return the shoes. So I went on ebay and got Go Run 3 Ride at a cheaper price and went down half size (size 7), which fit well just like my size 7.5 Go Run 2. So my suggestion is if you're buying online, since you're still trying the size and fit (whether it's too large like my experience or it's too small like the others here), try them inside the house first to make sure they do fit correctly. Other than the fit, the shoes did feel quite comfortable (though Go Run 3 Ride is definitely more comfortable).","For me, the fit is half size larger than previous Go Run 2"

Normally, I wouldn't go straight into a tennis match with brand-new shoes, as I did with these--and they hugged my foot without feeling too tight and I finally, FINALLY could feel some cushioning under my foot, which I've been searching for. I have a rather wide forefoot but a narrow heel, so it's typically difficult to find something that can accommodate both of those issue, but even in the medium width--these did the trick.

negative,2.0,"I am deeply disappointed to say that the 'new' pair of Clarks Women's Society Gown Ankle Boot,Black Leather,6.5 M US that I purchased from Amazon were damaged. The leather near the toes of the left side has a tiny tear. Upon closer inspection I realized that the heels were partially worn down as well. I have to ship this back from Trinidad, West Indies. I paid freight, duties & taxes. AND I have to pay again to ship back the damaged items. I paid for new shoes... Real new shoes, not the fake 'new' ones I received. Come on Amazon, this should have been sold as a Warehouse Deal, not as a new pair of shoes. I can't recall ever having a problem like this with merchandise sold by Amazon, but I guess there is a first time for everything. Too bad for me.

Now, if not for the fact that I got this disappointingly damaged pair of shoes I would be quite pleased with this purchase. I would have rated them 5 stars. (Fast shipping, nice packaging) Can't do that though, I paid too much for this kind of disappointment.

When I recovered from the horror of seeing that tiny tear on my 'brand new', eagerly anticipated, Comfort Shop, Clarks shoes I somehow still found the courage to try them on. It was just a tiny tear I told myself. The shoes are wayyy down there on the ground, maybe no one will notice. I tried them on.. My feet were nicely cushioned. The fit was a bit close. I bought another pair of this size and brand that was a perfect fit. I think the leather should break in nicely after a day of wear. They look great too. Nice leather (the parts that are not torn). The rubber soles have a nice grip but WAIT... the shoes did not feel completely sturdy. I pulled them off and turned them over. Lo and behold! The outer back corners of the heels on both shoes were worn down. The heels on my 'new' shoes were worn down! They are UNEVEN. Unbelievable. I guess these were previously returned. They didn't come in the usual box with the Clarks logo.

negative,1.0,"A lot of people seem to have had success with this dress, and unfortunately I did not. I have a vintage event coming up, and amid the $80 to $100 price tags for very nice vintage clothing, I was hoping this dress would do the job based on the other reviews.

I am 5' 2"", 125 pounds, with an hour glass figure, and D cups. I was really surprised how this didn't fit me very well, despite all of the rave reviews. I can't wear a strapless bra with it, as it sits far too low on my back. So, I'm not getting any good cleavage out of the dress, along with the neck-line being too high to show much of anything without there being support, which is frustrating if you want to show some cleavage off.

As a shorter-than-average person, the dress is incredibly long, almost down to my ankles. I understand this is the style, because it's a vintage dress, but it's just slightly too long for me. ""Well why can't you get it hemmed?"" I can already hear people saying, but if there's one thing I hate, it's having to spend more money on something I just spent money on (the trials and tribulations of being juuuuuust a couple inches too short for most pants and dresses). I might as well go out and buy a more expensive dress for better quality fabric than take the time and money to find someone to hem it.

Lastly in the back of the dress, is a panel of stretchy material - as in there's no zipper. For me it totally destroyed the ""vintageness"" of the dress. It makes me feel like I'm wearing a beach dress (you know, the beach dresses with the bunched up sections of elastic that make it easy to throw on.). It's also part of the reason why it doesn't sit right on me - the stretchy fabric makes it too loose so it moves around a lot. That's not a great feeling when you can't wear a bra with it. I suppose that's what I get for going for a cheaper dress. A zipper would've totally made this dress better in my opinion. It would've been snugger and just overall would have been a little classier.

For pros, I will say the color of the dress is nice. It's a pretty, vibrant blue. I'm not a huge fan of the material, but the price point was fantastic, which is why I went for the dress in the first place. Despite my issues with it, a lot of people seem to really like the dress and who knows, it might fit you better than it did me.","Didn't work out for me, personally."

negative,1.0,"They're cute, but poorly designed. Wouldn't fit my daughter's feet (they were too big as far as length, etc.) because the elastic does not stretch enough to get her chubby baby feet into the shoe. She's average weight and has normal, chubby feet (as the majority of babies do), so I'm not sure how anyone would get normal baby feet into the shoes without cutting them or altering them somehow. We weren't able to use them at all, waste of money for us and they weren't cheap for baby shoes! Unless your child has REALLY skinny feet, don't buy these!",Very disappointed!

negative,1.0,"This dress is made very badly.  The front is not stitched to the lining so the lining pulls up and out in the front of the dress.  I am a seamstress so I fixed that.  The back is way longer than the front so the ruffle hangs down and looks like a mistake.  Should have been straight all the way around, which I did to mine.

I live in slippers like these so whenever I see a good deal on a decent looking pair, I try to pick them up. When I saw the $16 sale price on these, I was worried the quality would be lacking. Boy was I wrong! They are beautiful and very well made. I love the navy color and there's a generous amount of fur inside, making them extremely comfortable. They do seem to run a little large, I typically wear a size 11 and the size 10 fits perfect.. I'm telling you, you don't want to miss out on these gorgeous slippers at this fabulous price! You cant get junk slippers at walmart for this price! I've already ordered a back up pair and if they're still on sale next week when we get paid, I'll be ordering a few more.. *EDIT* That was my original review of these slippers. I initially gave them a 5 star rating and I absolutely loved them. They are beautiful slippers, they don't stretch out too bad and the tops of the shoes didn't become stained & dirty looking like these types of shoes often do. However, after about a month of wear, the bottom of the shoe has split from the top, causing a big hole and making them unusable. I purchased 2 backup pairs but considering how long the first pair lasted, I don't have high hopes for them.. I am totally disappointed and upset. I thought I'd finally found a quality pair of slippers that didn't cost a fortune, but unfortunately I was wrong. I guess in some instances you really get what you pay for.",I'm inlove!.. *EDIT* NOT ANYMORE!
negative,2.0,"This product was very disappointing. I was excited to get it because I have square shoulders and no waist, I was looking for something to make me look a bit more shapely. Well first off I have to say, WASH BEFORE WEARING!! This thing is so incredibly filthy, it turned the water brown. It took three rinses before the water ran clear after I washed it. Secondly, while it did fit snug and was s bit uncomfortable to wear, it actually INCREASED my waist size, by about 2 inches. I put it on and thought it made me look bigger, at first I convinced myself that I simply wasn't used to seeing myself with a more proportional figure, but when I went to put on clothes, I couldn't ignore how large it made me look and feel, so I grabbed my tape measure and the numbers don't lie.

At any rate, I did give it two stars because it does at least compress my ribs which flare out at the bottom causing me to lose shape, so I will see how wearing this to the gym works. Maybe as I tone up a bit more and lose fat it will have more benefits.",Overall disappointing.

negative,1.0,"I love the looks of these shoes, and I had another pair just like these that were size 9, which were WAY too big, but very soft & comfortable.  I returned those and ordered size 8 from amazon.  The size strangely is still just a tad big, (strange because I normally wear size 8.5-9), but the first day I wore them I had jury duty and had to walk about 4 blocks to the courthouse and 4 blocks back to my car.  There was something very, very ROUGH all across the top of these shoes INSIDE the shoes, and by the end of the day when I got back to my car, my feet were literally BLEEDING from the ""roughness"" in these shoes, and I had about 4-5 blisters on my feet.  i could barely make it back to my car - literally.  The first pair exactly like them, but were too big, (size 9) were REALLY SOFT and COMFORTABLE - just too big, and I did not feel any roughness at all in them.  The reason I bought these was supposed to be for comfort.  So now I have worn these shoes and can't return them, and I don't think I will ever be able to wear them because they put blisters on my feet and made them bleed.  I have never had any shoes do this to me before.  But it was a total waste of money because now that they have been worn, I can't return them.  I am very, very disappointed.  Maybe this was just a ""freak"" pair that, for whatever reason were SOOOO rough on the top part of the shoe inside.  I think probably this is the case, because the first pair I got were SUPER comfortable - just too big.  This is really strange for Crocs.  I have other Crocs and they are the most comfortable shoes I own - so why these were just so horrible, I don't know, but I'm pretty upset about the blisters and not being able to wear them.  I only received them the day before I had to go to court, so I just put them on the next day and wore them, assuming that, like my other Crocs shoes and like the previous pair like these that were too large, they would just be really comfortable..  I have never had to ""break in"" a pair of Crocs before.  Like I said, they are normally the most comfortable shoes I own.

The toe never wears out, its normally the heel that eventually goes. The calf part of the socks always maintains its elasticity regardless of the fact that my husband is a big man and stretches them while in use.

negative,2.0,"USE
Bought this water shoe for a beach trip to protect my feet from hot sand while walking the beach and sharp rocks while swimming. It did these things well, however, once sand got into the shoe, it was difficult to get it out.

FIT
I normally wear an 11/12, and the 11 fit me with no room to spare (good for a water shoe). This probably means the shoe is running a bit large. I had no problems with the insert slipping out or the shoe falling off. The shoe was quite comfortable to wear. At first it kept rubbing my angle, but I loosened the elastic drawstring and that solved the problem.

CLEANING
This shoe is very difficult to clean. No matter how much sand I rinsed out of the shoe, there always seemed to be more, even though I removed the insert. The shoe also takes FOREVER to dry. I tried hanging them, leaving them on a towel with a fan blowing, and leaving them in the sunshine to dry, but without fail, they wouldn't be completely dried by the next day. After 3 days of use, they started to develop a funky mold smell and I had to throw them in the washing machine to get rid of it. Way more than I bargained for.

OVERALL
Overall, the shoe was great for the first use, and a waste thereafter. I wouldn't buy it again.",Not practical for the beach

negative,1.0,"Unfortunately this skirt was a huge disappointment for me. First of all, the fabric is not very great, but as the print on it is pretty, I could have lived with that and also the fact that it needs ironing to look acceptable. The bigger problem is that the skirt does not have a full shape, so in my case, while it fits my waist (just barely), the skirt picks up on my hips and does not really get wide enough to fall freely. This is really not what I was expecting, as with high waisted A line skirts I usually just have to make sure the waist fits, and the rest works out fine. I do need to note that I have very wide hips, and I wear a larger size in pants than tops and there's quite a bit of a difference between my waist and hips - so if you're not a very pronounced pear shape, this skirt might fit you way better. Another issue for me was that it has an underskirt, but it is so short and so small I couldn't pull it down on my hips (if I was keeping the skirt, I guess I could cut it out). Yet another issue is the way the elastic waistband was tailored: the elastic inside it in my case is sort of twisted, and does not lie flat even when completely stretched.
I hate to leave such a negative review, but I will have to return this skirt as I'm sure I won't wear it.

Anyway, I bought the two pairs on 9-12-08 and today is 10-30-12.  So I've had the two pairs for over 4 years.  They are all I've been wearing for the entire time that I've owned them.  I alternate wearing between the two pair.  They held up very well.  The only thing that wore out on them was the lining on the inside of the heels.  I suppose that can be fixed by a shoe repairman.

Since I had good luck with both pairs of the old New Balance shoes, I expected the same from the new pair of the 577 model.  I was terribly disappointed.  I bought the new ones mail order and the old ones at J C Penney where I was fitted in person.  I should not have mail ordered the new ones.  I don't think I'm going to mail order any more shoes.  This is the second time I've had serious problems when mail ordering shoes.

Anyway, I went past the period where you can return them, but I'm going to try to return them anyway.

The zipper and construction are cheap. Overall, it feels like something you would get as packaging to be thrown away when you buy new formal clothes. The handles are placed without any though as to how one would actually carry the bag.

negative,2.0,"I truly wish I had never bought this item but I'm way out of the return window now.  I work and play outside year round but I'm unfortunately cold when it's below 70 degrees.  That is why I have a large bin of long underwear and cold gear of all types.  After a particularly chilly backpacking trip due to wind, I decided to up my game with these and wow I don't think I could be more disappointed.

First, they are quite bulky for being of what I would consider high design and even higher price tag that you get when you go Arcteryx.  Compared to a UA base 4, I'd say they are almost twice as thick for not even being as warm.  As to any wind protection, HA!, yeah, no.  Maybe 5 mph.  20 mph is coming straight through.  I was recently on a trip at the Canadian border when a cold spell broke.  I put on a thin base layer, a medium, and these and was still cold till I threw rainpants over top.  When I used UA layering, it was far superior on top of being cheaper.

I'll wear them but it will never be for recreational activity and I will put them in the for work pile where I can wear more bulky stuff under my bib overalls.  These remind me more of my cheaper expedition weight stuff that ran in the 30 dollar range.  If that's what I had paid, I would have been happy with the product but there is just no way these perform at the level claimed and priced.  This is likely the last time I shell out the money for this brand.  With long underwear, it can make the difference between misery and happiness but you don't know it till you get out in the cold.  Lesson learned.

One positive, they fit true to size and are quite comfy.",Chilly Reception

They are a little thin almost a thicker t shirt material which is okay for my smaller chested daughter.  However not really strong enough for the larger chest.  She used the cups from a swim suit and sewed them into the inside

They both really liked the straps and said they were comfortable yet not too wide that you seen them

Had these for about a month. Wore them 3 days a week. Walking bare feet would is much more comfortable.

Pros:

- Wonderful pair of shoes for walking in dog s***
- none
- great pair of shoes to wear down your feet to get a bionic limb.
- great way to learn a hard lesson to invest in quality shoes.
- great way to rack up feet related medical bills.

Cons:

- no insoles.
- no aftermarket insoles will make this shoe even remotely wearable.
- makes your feet hurt, especially the heels.
- not even water proof. My feet wear soaked after a full day of wearing them on a moderate to heavy rainy day.
- sides of the shoe flaps flair out even after tying it down tightly.
- made in Vietnam, I'm Vietnamese and know not to buy anything made in Vietnam. Had Nike Shox and they fell apart after a months of use. Guess where its made from, Vietnam.
- soles get dirty real quick, can't exchange or return them if they are
- Poor ""leather"" quality. I scratched it lightly with my finger nail to test it out and left a noticeable mark.

I'm not going to tell you that if you think you're stylish you shouldn't but someone closer to you probably should.  They're big red floppy booties.  My wife says they're comfortable enough but the 'nonskid' part is pretty misleading.  'Skid resistant'?  Maybe.  They're very slightly less likely to 'skid' then a regular pair of cotton socks but to call them 'nonskid' is a giant leap.  And that's if they're on your feet perfectly.  Because they're so over-sized, for someone with small feet like my wife, it is entirely possible for the primary contact area with the floor to miss most of the 'nonskid' surfacing put on these.

negative,2.0,"I've worn Warner's wirefree bras for years, but my size has changed and I find I am needing a bit more coverage and support as I get older (*sigh*) so I've been trying out several styles on in local stores over the past month or so.  I must say before I begin that I absolutely HATE shopping for bras!

This bra was a style that the stores in my area didn't have in my new/correct size (36D) so after reading reviews on several websites, I ordered one here on Amazon (best price by far).

The bra looked well made with quality materials upon first inspection, and the band fit was right on...but the one I received had a very stiff scratchy edge on the back hook/eye placket that was irritating on my skin. Another problem was that the thick bottom band kept rolling up under the right cup, and I only had the bra on for a short time, so I knew it wasn't just something that was going to happen after all day wear.  Not comfy at all.  Also, the cups were a bit stiff, not at all the soft/stretchy lightly padded ones like on other Warner styles I've had; and if you got a chill, everyone would know it, if you get the drift.

Thankfully the seller I purchased from has a good refund policy (I always check that before I buy, and leave the tags on while test driving) so I shipped it back and although I am still awaiting my refund from Beall's of Florida, I'm sure it will come through eventually.

I have found a different bra from Warner's that I like, their ""No Side Effects"" bra, and although they don't make it in my exact size, I purchased it in the ""sister size"" of 38C and then took in the band on each side to adjust the fit.  It worked out pretty well but sadly, taking in the band did flatten the cups a little more than I was expecting.

However, I have to say that the BEST, most supportive, comfortable wirefree bra I have found to date is the Maidenform Comfort Devotion #9432, which I had to purchase online to try as it too is not carried in local stores.  It has soft, molded cups, and for me the size L fits perfectly, with more comfort, support, lift and enhanced profile than any of the other bras I've tried in my search, with just enough padding in the cups to hide the chills.  I hope that all the different colors I ordered will fit the same as the first one I purchased..(it's a mystery to me why the bra in the same make, size and style can vary in fit from color to color..)

The only ""problem"" I've had with this bra, which is not problematic enough to me to make me not like the bra, is I find that the wide smooth bottom band tends to bunch up a bit under the cups after you wear it awhile, especially once you sit down or hunker forward reaching for something.  The band is very soft however, so it doesn't irritate me or squeeze my rib-cage uncomfortably, but I did want to mention it.

negative,1.0,"I really wanted to like this dress. While the photo of the dress makes it look like a festive Christmas red, the dress definitely is the ""Lady in Red"" Dress... not an issue, actually. I was hoping it would be brighter.

My beef with this dress is two-part:

1. The nice ruffled skirt was badly wrinkled and misshapen. Because the fabric was so stiff (probably from the sizing chemicals they use to pack it), the only way it could possible lay that way would be to dry clean it... but again, the fabric seemed like a heavier-duty canvas cotton, so probably no pretty ruffles without intentionally ironing it like that.

2. Instead of being sewn in that shape, that lovely braided fabric bodice that shows in the image is held together by a few stitches. I'm a bustier lady in general, so it did not look anything like that photo once I had it on, rather looking more like a weird braided pretzel sort of thing than a lovely stitched pattern.

I really wanted to love this dress... it was just unflattering and not good in many ways.","Buyer Beware: Wonky construction, and it does not look like the photos."
negative,2.0,"The leather straps are very wire, and the clasp is strange. It fits very very loosely, and looks strange because the straps don't stick together like the picture.

negative,2.0,"I want to be fair in rating this, and if there were half-stars I'd give this 2.5 stars. The issue here is entirely about fit. A person of a particular shape might find this very good.

The material is strong, and the fabric is pleasant to the touch. I like the design and the color.

The problem is that it does not fit my frame as expected. I have typically had good luck ordering shirts through the mail. I am 5'6"" tall and typically do well with regular fit shirts. In this case, the shoulders are oddly wide. It's therefore uncomfortable and looks kind of strange. If there's one thing I know about fashion it's that the fit is the most important aspect. A smaller person wearing shabby clothes just looks short and/or sloppy. If I had tried this on in a store, I would have immediately put it down and moved on.

negative,2.0,"I really wanted to like this product because besides being a perfect color match, it really evened out my skin tone and gave me the most amazing glow -- at least when looking in my house/bathroom mirror.  I didn't see a single sparkle; just a lovely sheen that made my skin look like it was glowing from within.  I was mesmerized by how perfect it made my complexion look that I was certain I had found my ""can't live without' beauty product.

Fast forward to later that afternoon; while running errands I took a glance up in my car mirror and was shocked to see that apparently, a glitter bomb had exploded on my face.  I looked like a sparkly disco ball!  I gave this another try the following day using just a smidge; but it still was way too sparkly in sunlight.  Would only possibly wear this product in the evening and even then; I'm not sure it'd be worth it if there were any chance of flash photography or having to walk into a well lit restroom with my girlfriends.  I may get some use out of this as a highlighter for my cheekbones or legs; but at my age, this type of sparkle is a big no no for all over face use.  The itty bitty sparkles accentuate all the things I want to keep hidden in daylight!  Fine lines, pores, imperfections.  It only looks good under dim lighting conditions.

***Update***
I hate throwing out perfectly good products and just wanted to share that I did find a use for this as a highlighter.  After applying makeup, a quick swipe down the center of my nose gives the bridge of my nose the perfect contoured look without all the work of contouring; no need to blend!  I also use a dab on my cupid's bow to highlight my lips and as a highlighter on my cheekbones/brow bones.  When used this way, the shimmer doesn't overwhelm your face and sink into pores/fine lines.  I'll probably have this 'forever' at the rate I'm using it (just a smidge here and there) but it's pretty much become a staple in my daily beauty routine.  I wouldn't feel put together and polished without it :).",Glitter Bomb :(

negative,1.0,"I will preface this review by saying the function and design are great.  I wore these once and was very happy with them. They worked great and the clasps were secure holding the fabric for the 12 hours I wore them.  So why the 2 stars?  Well, on the second morning I went to put them on, one clasp simply fell off. Looking at the seam on fabric that is folded over holding the clasp to the fabric trying to figure out why this would happen
revealed that the thread sewn into the seam holding on the clasp appeared to only pierce the seam about 3-4 times and was certainly defective in the manufacture of the item. This lead me to look at the other stays and, to no surprise, I found that the seams holding the clasp on all of them were all very poorly sewn was every one was in some stage of coming apart...so the seams retaining the clasp on all of these stays will likely have failed by the second wearing.  On a side note, I did not have these fastened down taught; they were actually slightly loose for comfort.  At 5'9"" and 145 lbs they just didn't have the strain on them to justify this kind of failure rate which is the reason for the poor rating,  Again, the design and function, when they were still in one piece was great and perhaps I will revise my review depending on the resolution.",Great design and functionality....poor manufacturing completely negates the positives...100% failure rate after wearing once.

**UPDATE** So this wallet ended up lasting about 6 months for me.  It started unraveling from the bottom and just got worse.

I mention this because I've found that with some shampoo, the water does matter. I've had my stylist use a shampoo on me that I loved in the salon (which is on city water) but didn't like as well once I used it at home.

I used this shampoo 4 times and unfortunately every time it made my hair very ""flyaway"".....not frizzy exactly because I don't have enough curl in my hair for it to frizz but I found if I wanted to pull it up in a bun/ponytail, I had lots and lots of individual hairs that were unruly and wouldn't stay in the ponytail but sort of floated around my head and normally I don't have this problem with my other shampoos.

Although I loved the scent - it was sort of a minty/botanical kind of smell, I would have had to use hairspray to keep it from floating/flyaways and I hate hairspray and only use it if I absolutely have to. I also tried using other styling products to reduce the flyaways but since my hair is fine, it doesn't take much before my hair seems weighed down.

This is ticketed as a wallet to fit your front pocket, probably because the money clip on the back protrudes from the wallet about a half inch. I did not like this wallet at all.

The clip is useless if you want to clip it to your pants pocket because the clip isn't at the very top - you'll have about an inch or more of wallet above the pocket line which looks absurd. If you want to use it in your back pocket you can feel the money clip because the hinge on the clip is actually about 1/2 inch thick and it sticks into your a$$. It looks awesome though and I really wanted this to work for me. Unfortunately there wasn't a pocket that I could make it work in. To boot, just like everyone else has mentioned, the ID slot is TOO BIG for a standard size drivers license. I even tried to pack other cards behind it to keep the ID from falling out.

neutral,3.0,"This band is a great value, and looks as good in person as in the photos.  It looks like a heavy quality band.  (It's really quite lightweight, but nice none the less.)  But it has a few flaws.  The first is that it's nearly impossible to adjust.  It has the J-shaped hooks that you push down-and-out to release.  They were in way too tight.  I wound up using penetrating oil and tearing one link apart.  It was so much work and effort that I should have spent another $20 for a band using pins instead.

The other problem is that while it looks micro-adjustable, it isn't really.  I think the deployment clasp - which is nice - is generic.  The links are too thick for the micro-adjust to be used more than a position in.  And very hard to move anyhow because the links are precisely the width of the clasp, so they don't fit without a lot of effort, which is hard when putting the pin in.

But if you can get it adjusted to your liking, it's a nice looking band for a great price.

Update: Because it's a low-cost bracelet, the metal links are folded, not solid.  I have hair on my wrists; this band grabs and plucks that hair.  Not as bad as a Twist-o-Flex band, but much worse than the more expensive bands of solid links.",Good value but hard to adjust

I have a narrow calf and these boots work for me, yet they are also easy to get on or off. I debated getting a size larger but then decided the heel would gap, even with thick socks.  I  may need to stretch the instep area, but maybe  the leather will stretch as I break the boots in. I have only worn them in the house so far.
I only gave three stars because the leather was not dyed evenly. I decided against sending the boots back and will just try to polish the part by the heel that is not dyed well.  It is not that obvious. The boots also had a very strong smell. - stronger than any other new leather products I have ever bought. I had them airing by a window for 3 days till the smell was down to a tolerable level.

For the price I don't completely regret buying a few different brand items - shirts and pants.  But the sizes and general fitment, combined with the exposed seams and shoddy sewing have me throwing in the towel.  Carhartt stuff is more expensive, but you truly do get what you pay for.

neutral,3.0,"First of all I want to point out that the boots I got did not have Vibram soles as advertised. The soles are marked ""Thorogood"" brand. I returned mine, but mainly because of a manufacturing defect: the footbed on the right side boot was uneven - high on the outside of the middle of the foot, which was immediately painful. Imagine having the arch support on the wrong side of the footbed. That's what it felt like. I assume that is a factory mistake. Aside from the defect and the lack of true Vibram sole the boots seem to be of good materials and construction. As to sizing, I wear size 13 to 14 depending on brand, and these seemed a bit snug for a 13. That is, they did not seem to be sized very large like a lot of reviewers have said.

They look well made, the leather is nice looking and has a nice feel. The eye-hooks seem a little lightweight and could be a weak link. The included removable footbed is nice quality, and that's a plus. The heel and  toe areas are reinforced and stiff. I found that the heels slipped even though the toes were snug, but that might fix with a break-in period, or maybe with a size up. Probably the 8"" boots would be less prone to heel slip. Even with the problems I mentioned I might try these again because they seem to be good boots for the price. But someone please fix the false advertising about the Vibram soles.

It is pretty warm when the side flaps are down, that is nice. The materials and workmanship seem high quality.

Cons:

1. It is not water repellent. The faux fur will really soak up water, and the entire outer portion is somewhat absorbent fabric.

2. When you close the clasp below your chin, it is not tight at all. In fact, the flaps go quite a ways below my chin.

neutral,3.0,"I like the look. They feel cheap, but the upper material is real leather and looks pretty good. I could live with that. I really like the style and wanted these to work so bad but the fit is off...in a very weird way.

First, the toe box is very narrow. It's ok at first, but I think after wearing the for a few hours it would hurt. For the price, if that was the only issue, I'd probably keep them. The calf fits fine, but the ankle area is really, really large - so when I walk, my feet slide around a lot every step. The boot kind of scrunches up weird there too because of all the extra material. It's uncomfortable, probably painful, and definitely unflattering. They're just a bit too tall as well. I'm 5'6"" and the top of the boot hits me right in the knee, which is awkward and uncomfortable. The boots are pull-on, not adjustable (no zipper, the ties are just decorative), so no matter what, the silhouette of the boot gives you those lovely instant ""kankles.""

Add the odd fit mixed with the fact that the inside is lined with PU leather - and I'd expect to prepare for major blisters developing throughout the day, even with heavy socks I think. Jeans might work ok if you can stuff them in without a zipper, but that wouldn't solve the super huge ankle area problem. Really bummed because I do really like the style. But I can't walk in them even for a few steps, so I have to return them.","odd fit. made for people with ""kankles,"" long legs, and very narrow toes."
neutral,3.0,"where do i even start? the positives. the flannel is very soft material, color is pretty, and the stitching is amazing. there is not a raw seam anywhere! i love the top. it's huge because i'm very petite and i bought a large because i want to sleep not wear it on a catwalk.

the negative... the rise is insane. as i said, i'm petite, 90 pounds, and the waistband barely came over my hips. i spent two hours carefully ripping the seams of the double sewn in elastic, yuck, to discover there is only 22 inches of fabric from side to side at the top! in what universe is that a large? the back rise is 16 inches. it's 4 inches higher than the front rise of barely 12 inches. whoever designed this thing made it for a mannequin and i'm barely past being one. if it won't fit an anorexic under 32 inch hips person then who will it fit?

i now have a lovely comfy pajama top for twenty dollars and tax... and some lavender flannel for my fabric stash i had not intended on buying. it might make a pillow slip or patch some old jeans.

Lume is virtually nonexistent. To me, though, the biggest let-down is the sloppiness of the movement. The minute hand will wiggle back and forth over the span of a full minute, even more when the crown is pulled out.

The heavy felt liner was a selling point for me. They are solid construction and the removal/replacement options are attractive. But in reality, the design seems to push your foot forward. You end up with excess space at your heel, and toes crammed forward. I ordered a size up, 8.5,  from what I normally wear (I run in 7-8, boots in 7.5-8) and they still cramped my toes. I was hoping the felt liner would compress a little and give my feet some breathing room, but several of my friends said that won't happen, and this is a know issue with these boots.

They aren't very comfortable as far as this style of shoe goes. I also don't like that they have a shiny finish rather then a matte finish. My husband told me they look like fake shoes or like Barbie shoes. I love the sole of the shoe, I ordered the green pair so the sole had the cute pineapple design and it is really fun. I like that the sole is pretty thick, you don't feel like you can feel the rocks you step on through it. The heel has a pretty thick piece which is actually quite nice if your standing for a while. I wore these without socks and got blisters walking around for the first few times wearing them. I think these are a fun shoe for the summer but don't expect them to be super comfy.

The Jockey 100% cotton tanks haven't shrunk like this one has.

The Jockey tank is a ribbed cotton, the Hanes is smooth and a little softer. It has a nice feel. The straps are a bit wider than I'm used to, but I think it'll work ok.

The ring is the most substantial piece. It can not be sized, so you have to hope that it will fit one of your fingers. It is just a little tight on my ring finger, but somewhat loose on my pinky.

I have large thighs so they kept hiking up, uncomfortable, might as well have just been a regular suit, would have been more comfortable.  Lastly, it's called a ""shaping body"" style suit...not so much.  I love wearing the snug fitting shaping suits but this was definitely not one of those so again, not as comfortable in the suit.

neutral,3.0,"Purchased 8 (2 each in 4 colors) loved the colors, not the material it is stiff and somewhat heavy, (FYI: I believe the reviews vary because all models of the Haines Adult Long Sleeve Tees are lumped into these reviews-but they are not the same, the version I purchased had a very small Neck, others say they are ""comfort tees "" and have a lower cut, larger neck. It would be helpful if reviewers named both the model & the seller in the title on these "" Includes all "" reviews since Amazon does not separate or has a filter that includes model type and seller. I read many reviews that the complaint is on the seller not the product.) Size is terrible. Let me say I believe size depends on the country where it is made. Haines Ts come from 3 countries that I know of. These were from Hati. Spouse wears a med. made in China. I ordered the large, I tried it on and it was to small for me and the neck was to tight, so returned. while waiting for the return I ordered a single shirt in a 2X, before reordering the eight in the larger size. When it arrived I immediately washed it with the thought it would shrink to a 1X, it did shrink somewhat, again tried it on, again the neck was to tight, the body fit but was snug and the arms were to long for me, that's when I gave up, once again knowing there was no way my hubby could wear one of these shirts, so I did not reorder- instead bought similar shirts by Fruit of the Loom at a local store so hubby could return and get a proper fit if needed.

neutral,3.0,"Picked up a pair of these as an alternative to LLR, they are ok. They may be even just a little softer. Why only gave them two stars is about the pattern. The pattern I ordered looks just like the product photo on one leg, but the other legs is really off. It's kind of a wide, up side down V pattern so on one side I have the center of the points going up the front of my leg and on the other just slanted lines. My leg is currently in an air cast that goes up to my knee. I ordered legging because I'm usually a dress girl in the summers, but I'm currently doing physical therapy 3x a day... so no dresses for me right now. At any rate my point is that with a short dress or tunic and the air cast, only a small bit of my left leg is visible, so having the pattern be so wonky isn't a huge concern right now. However, I won't be wearing them in public after the cast comes off. If you are looking at this brand as an alternative to LLR, here are my thoughts:
1- order a print that looks ok if it's not the same on both sides
2- I wear tall and curvy in LLR and the plus fits just fine. In number size I am around 20.
3- The waist is different. I have very short waist. My LLR tall and curvy come up to between my belly button and my breast, but they have a yoga waist so it just folds down... These come up a little higher in the front, but have an elastic waist. The back dose not come up nearly as high as the front. If my butt was larger these might not cover it so well. At first I thought I put them on backwards, maybe next time I will put them on backwards to see if that helps. Honestly, if the waist was different I'd order every pair that didn't have prints that you would want to match on both sides.
4- Like LLR, the pattern on these don't stretch out of shape.
5 - I love the print I got, if only it matched up.
6- I mentioned this earlier, but they are so so soft. I wore them to a LLR party tonight and everyone thought it was the LLR brand in a print they hadn't seen. Even after touching them.","Decent alternative to LLR, but watch the print you choose."

I would exchange them for a size up, however, according to their website and by my estimates, it would cost me almost $30 just to exchange for a different size due to shipping rates and restocking fees when I already paid $48 for what is supposed to be my size.

Because I'm not made of money, I can't afford to exchange them so I guess I'll have to suffer this year with these shoes or just yard sale them and try to find a cheap replacement. :/

going on in politics lately, I wanted to show my support for and celebrate our Democracy. This was the best
looking in my opinion. I ordered it in a Medium I may have been able to go down to a small. Its got lots
of extra room. I originally thought it might shrink a little in washing, and then still allow me to layer under it.
However, the website says its 80% cotton, 20% Poly the tag says its 60% cotton and 40% poly.
Not much chance of it shrinking with that much polyester. It also will probably pill as all blends like that do.
But. the worst is..Im allergic to synthetic fibers so an accurate description of fibers is not only the law, its
imperative!  The higher the synthetic percentage, the less likely I can get away with wearing it. Im
very disappointed. Had I known it was 60-40 I wouldnt have ordered it. All that said, its a nice hoodie jacket.

The upper pockets- one on the right; two on the left (dont ask)- are tiny ant good for carrying anything other than loose change. The lower pockets, where I and probably a large number of other people keep their mobile phone, are SO low that anything kept there (like your phone) bounces off your knee. So annoying that I pulled out my phone after 10 sec. for me, sort of defeats one if the main reasons for wearing cargo pants. Other than that I like the fit, feel and look if the pants.

The right shoe was quite comfortable but the left shoe was not. The left seemed smaller in the toe area than the right.  Could just be my left foot is bigger? Maybe, but normally I wear size 10.

5 Stars for quality.  This hat is exceptionally well made and comfortable.  The materials are top quality and I expect to use it for years to come - under certain circumstances in the summers.

1 Star for poor descriptions and advertising photos.  This hat is not what I expected in terms of size or construction.  I was looking for a traditional 'Panama' style hat for the summer.  First off, the hat is much taller than expected.  Most 5"" to 6"" tall descriptions of hats are usually what's measured when the hat is on and stretched to conform.  This hat is 7 inches tall right out of the box.  I figured 'great, it should crush down to comform a bit' but no, it doesn't.  The height makes it nearly impossible to wear in the car to deal with the sun while driving.  The ""Shapeable Brim"" is also a problem.  The brim is shapeable because it has a wire insert in the outer edging.  The wire limits the ability to wash the hat and god forbid that you bump the brim against a more solid object - instant dent.  I have made theatrical wire brimmed hats and the wire eventfully becomes unshapeable over time as the wire loses strength.  For wire rimmed hats, you put them in hats with brown or black color materials covering them to hide the eventual rust stains.",Great... but not what was expected

neutral,3.0,"The style of this tunic shirt is really cute. I love the length of the sleeves, and the shape of the neckline. The bottom hem is fun and floaty and would be really flattering... But I can't wear it. It fits fine on my torso, pretty well, actually. But the sleeves are so tight that I could barely get them on, and then I could not lift my arms. This is a weird thing, as I can't recall ever having trouble with the sleeves of a top not fitting me. The fabric is pretty stretchy, but also very thin, so I wasn't going to try to pull and stretch it, as it looked like it might tear if I had tried. I ended up giving it to my very, very thin teenage daughter to wear. The fabric is thin enough that she has to wear a tank top under int, or it is see- through in the sun light. Also, the neckline is wider than expected (on both of us) and is basically an off the shoulder blouse, which is cute, as long as it's what you are expecting. Over all, it is a cute top, and she will be wearing it, but the proportions just seem off on this one.

neutral,3.0,"I ordered the largest size (XXL) because Asian sizes always seem to run small, and I'm glad I did. For reference, I usually wear a size 8-10, my waist is 34 inches, and I am 5'5. Absolutely do not go by the Amazon size chart. The seller has their own size chart with the item pictures. The size chart is a little weird, or maybe my body is a little weird, because I usually wear an 8 or 10, yet my waist is 34 inches, but the largest size has a waist measurement of 33 inches, so that doesn't line up quite right. Anyway, the skirt has 3 to 4 inches of elastic in the waistband, so there is a little wiggle room. I recommend going by the waistband measurement as opposed to your dress size. The 33-inch waistband fits around my 34-inch waist just fine, lol. The elastic definitely helps with comfortability. Because of the elastic, I can wear this skirt a little lower, about two inches below my bellybutton. Either way, the skirt falls just below my knees.

The fabric is thicker than I expected. It's silky on the outside. There is no button closure above the zipper to aid in zipping the skirt. The cherry blossoms on the fabric look blurry and not as pretty as in the pictures on Amazon. The stitching seems okay for now. I ordered the skirt in green, and the green is a pretty medium green, a kelly green, I would say.

The fit is weird. There is too much fabric and it bulks up in weird places and makes me look chunky. I don't know if that is due to my body type or poor design. It's obvious, now that I look back at the picture on Amazon, that the skirt is Photoshopped onto a model. She isn't actually wearing the skirt. I thought the skirt looked good in the picture, but now that I realize there isn't a picture of anyone actually wearing the skirt, I'm wondering if the fit is bad on everyone. My husband says he likes the way it looks, but his judgment can't be trusted, lol.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend this skirt. Maybe if you were in a store and could try it on, yeah, sure, if the price is right and it looked good, I would say get it. But buying it online with how unpredictable the sizing is and how weird it fits, I really can't recommend it. I think this style of skirt would probably look better on thinner people.

They looked very similar to me so I thought I'd buy both and see what the difference was.  One question/reviewer on the SPACER bra stated that it was simply a matter of nicer and thicker fabric.  This is NOT correct.  A spacer bra is supposed to do exactly what it says, space your breasts apart.  For this bra at least it has nothing to do with the quality of the fabric. The Spacer fabric does have far less stretch/give which is intentionally done to keep your breasts from squeezing together.  The Embellished bra is a memory foam and therefore will conform more to your natural shape rather than forcing them apart with stiffer fabric.  For reference I am a 36C/D and did not want my breast to be spaced apart.

PROS and CONS for both:

STRAPS:
- Spacer bra has thicker and more padded straps than the Embellished bra.
- Embellished bra has a non-slip silicone type grip on the underside of the strap that really DO work.  No slippage at all.
-Embellished bra straps are thinner, more standard thickness, no padding or cushion on the straps.

LACE DETAILS:
-Both bras are pretty and have lace details but in different places.
-Spacer bra lace is on the side panels all the way around the body that hangs down slightly over the seam. Therefore itchier and you can definitely feel it on your ribs and back.
-Embellished bra has lace stitched to the side panels with no overhang so you can't feel the lace at all.  Less noticeable as the lace is under your armpit area.
-Both panels have a lace triangle between the breasts, no noticeable difference in feel/look.

COVERAGE:
- Spacer bra has more coverage on the cups so less overflow.
-Embellished bra is softer and conforms more to your cups.

FABRIC:
-Spacer bra feels cheaper, more stiff and scratchy with absolutely NO stretch at all in the cups (again, intended to shape/space your breasts apart).
-Spacer bra fabric is stiff, so much so that the bra was bent in the package and the crease remains even after machine washing twice.
- Embellished bra is a soft memory foam and is actually soft to the touch all around, including the straps. No creasing after packing it and travelling and bending it all around in my drawer and washing machine.

THE VERDICT:
Maidenform One Fab Fit Extra Coverage Embellished Underwire lace bra with nonslip straps is more comfortable, softer, and most likely better suited to more breast shapes as the memory foam will conform to each body easily.",Spacer versus Embellished styles

neutral,3.0,"I work in a business formal office and purchased this pump as an alternative to my more delicate-heeled shoes. I ordered several other practical heels and found that this was the best option aesthetically. First, the vamp is low enough to provide support without being matronly. This was a major issue with other shoes in the comfort category. Second, the almond toe adds a level of classic sophistication that its rounder and pointier counterparts often lack.

The chunky heels are great for stability, but the angle of the heel will drive your foot into the toe box. In conjunction with the low vamp, this becomes a problem as you are likely to get corns on the top of your toes. These shoes seem to run slightly large, so if you order in your usual size, you might also have to contend with a significant space between your heel and ankle. It makes walking without slipping out of the shoe a conscious effort.

Overall, this shoe scores high marks for stability and (relative) attractiveness, but it is not as comfortable as you would think.",Stability in a relatively attractive package

neutral,3.0,"I got this model of Sketchers in a dark purple on clearance at a national discount retail chain that sells name-brand items for less.  I would not have purchased them unless they were on clearance because the fuzzy material, which is really like a soft felt, picks up a LOT of lint, but I thought I'd give them a once over with a lint roller, and clean them up.  But, the properties of lint attracting is ongoing.  I have two small dogs, and my Sketchers are now a furry addition to the family.  These also don't support as well as other Sketchers I own.  (I have 4 other pairs.) So, I am deducting 2 stars for these reasons. However, I am giving them 3 stars because of how I use them and they suit my purpose rather well.  I use them as slippers.  They support much better than typical slippers, but not as well as regular walking shoes or sneakers.  I have wide feet in general, and a regular 10M in these stretch out quite a bit after ""broken in"" for a few days due to the nature of the felt fabric.  They are more comfortable than any other pair of slippers I've ever owned.

It is NOT the same.  The material of these is much thicker, which could be good for some people.  It will protect your legs more when moving around in the woods, etc.  But it will also wrinkle like crazy and not look good, even with ironing.  The B260s had velcro on the pockets, these have snaps.  They snap securely, very securely so this could be a plus for some, but it makes getting my wallet or phone out of a pocket more tedious.  If you leave them unsnapped they make a lot of noise from the snaps hitting each other.  The cloth also make much more noise than the discontinued B260s so not great for hunting.

I was looking for pants to use for work.  I'm a meat cutter so they have to look professional and be very durable but still comfortable with plenty of pockets.  The older B260s were fine for that.  These are too stiff, hold wrinkles, and have pockets that aren't as convenient.  So now I am looking for a new brand of pants.  Thanks Oba....err...  Carhartt.

neutral,3.0,"I purchased the Asian fit Chainlink sunglasses straight from Oakley. I was expecting the matte black finish to be high quality, instead it seemed like a cheap coating instead of the unpainted plastic found on the Standard Issue line of Oakley frames. The Chainlink's matte finish shows oil stains VERY easily. The weight is 27 grams, which isn't heavy but it isn't light. My M Frames (original 1.0) and Flak Jacket XLJ are only 25 grams and are about the perfect weight. I found the Chainlinks to feel heavy on my nose and the nose pads pinch into my nasal cavities creating some fatigue within a few minutes. The earstems have the Unobtanium material and it goes all the way to the frames which makes no sense, but the earstems are placed in a way that actually interferes with opening/closing the ear stems.

The Asian Fit frame fits my face, but the actual frame surrounding the lenses gets in the way BIG TIME. I used to think my Scalpels were like blinders for a horse until I tried the Chainlink. The sides of the frames pretty much block my view of the sideview mirrors on my car. It always made me feel nervous about passing a car because of the lack of peripheral vision. The frame on the bottom blocks a lot of the view as well due to the small lens size. Because the Chainlink is relatively flat, there is a lot of open space between the face and the edges of the lenses. When I walked around a windy beach with my Flak Jacket XLJ's (which pretty much hug my face even at the corners of the eyes) I still got some sand in my eyes. With the Chainlink, there is absolutely no protection on the sides - so sand/grit would easily fly in, and a lot of sun will be leaking through the sides. For the uninformed, the Asian Fit differs from the regular version only in the nose bridge and temples to fit heads that have smaller noses and wider faces. Everything else about the Asian Fit is the same as the regular version (same lenses, frame material, etc...) so my comments about visibility, weight, finish quality, etc... would still apply!

Bottom line, the Chainlink is more of a fashion set of frames more than anything. They are useless for any type of outdoor activities that require good peripheral vision or side protection. The matte finish feels cheap and shows off grease/oil stains very easily, and the earstems are hard to open because the Unobtanium/silicone sock material gets in the way.

Overall: 3/5 stars, I'm going to stick with my 6 year old Flak Jackets as they are lighter, more comfortable, offer more protection, and do not interfere with my peripheral vision.",Frames are too small and block a LOT of peripheral vision
neutral,3.0,"I like the fabric, the pockets and the extra pen slot on the left pocket, but the cut is too slender for a work or sport shirt. If I had the body this shirt is designed to fit, I'd be shopping at Abercrombie and Fitch. The sleeves bind at the armpit, and the sides are too tapered. So, I can only recommend this shirt for casual use, such as standing around without moving your arms much, and for slender guys without love handles or stomach bulge.

neutral,3.0,"For once what I think is a Chinese product fits. I really needed an extra large but since they did not have one, I gambled and got a large. A little tight but when I loose that last ten pounds, it will be perfect. What I mainly got it for are those cool summer mornings and evenings. No lining, thin material... Just right for my needs. However, I do think it is overpriced for the quality of cloth and as another reviewer stated, it does not hang/drape the way it does in the picture. To be honest, it seems rather cheaply made. Another issue is the cloth buttons:  they were obviously a cost cutting measure; I'm thinking since there are so many, it will be an issue if one gets lost. Since the coat is overpriced in my opinion these things are an issue. It could be professionally sized (if they still do that at cleaners) and maybe water proofed. That will give the material more body and make it practical if it is a sprinkle. If you are buying this as a practical trench, it may not be durable enough to get caught in anything but a light rain. I do like the styling with the buttons down the side but in order for those to be more flattering, you do need to order the correct size which in my case right now would have been an extra large. All in all, I am happy enough with it but don't know if I would buy again for the price.",Like it but think it is overpriced for the quality.

- Material is quite thin.  This might be a benefit in very humid climates, but I wouldn't be comfortable with my daughter wearing it without an undershirt.
- Length is on the short side if the intention is to tuck it in.
- Pocket design is nice.
- Fit and finish is just mediocre. Seam stithcing and threadwork is passable.
- Tight under the arm, sleeve on the short side (not good or bad, just a design choice), while the shoulder is quite poofy.  Much poofier than in the picture.

neutral,3.0,"First of all these are so adorable. I use cloth diapers so they are a great way to keep your kids legs warm (in the cold months) and make diaper changes (and potty training) a cinch.

I think they are more practical in the fall under dresses for playing vs. traditional tights.  My daughter is not a small toddler and they easily stretched to fit her.

neutral,3.0,"I only weigh 100lbs.. but I've always had that notorious ""pooch"". even as a skinny girl. OH, ONE THING- i'm a beyond annoyed about the false advertisement  in no way, shape, or form are these steel boning. they are so bendable, it is most obvious they are plastic.  with that being said, it was only $18. you get what you pay for. anyway, I am 5'4, 100lbs, 33/26/33, C/Dcup. I really was not sure whether to buy the small or the extra small. So I bought both and returned one. I tried the extra small on first, and it fits perfect at the loosest hook. in fact, this is somewhat of an update.. after wearing it throughout the day, I am now able to fasten it on the tightest hook. So yes, this material stretches. I have not washed it yet, but it should tighten up.  As it is only the material stretching. Anyway I returned the small, hasslefree. it is a nice cincher though, it gives my little frame a bit of an hourglass shape. this is definitely not for ""waiste training"", which is actually dangerous, this just nips, flattens, and hides your abdominal flaws.. while definitely adding some definition to your waist. this is very comfortable, and does remind me to sit up straight. honestly, I am afraid of warping the plastic boning. but that is good for me, as I am a huge sloucher lol.  this is absolutely perfect for posture training!!  this would by no means be acceptable to a corset connoisseur.. but for someone who wants to look good in a tight dress, this is what you need. It works much better than Spanx. I compared my spanx to this, and while the spanx was invisible under all clothing, the spanks still showed my ""pooch"", while this did not- the ""pooch"" is gone:). The boning hides tummy fat much better. Keep in mind though this is especially obvious (the boning) under certain clothing, especially tight, light colors. but it is basically invisible under tight black clothing, and it will definitely look fine under any other shirt or dresses.. given it is not skintight and nearly see-through. Other than being deceived by the ""steel boning"" claim, I am very happy. that is the sole reason I deducted stars. had they said upfront it was plastic, I would've left five stars. Great deal for $18 ",awesome .. just wish it were real steel boning. I hate being lied to!

neutral,3.0,"I have had this winder for about a week now and i really like it.  It is quiet enough to keep in my bedroom.  Turns gently in either direction, not a swinging motion.  I settled on frequency setting B (A, B, C, D are the options, basically A is lowest amount of winding minutes per hour , B is slightly more, C is more and D is most. I chose the automatic setting for direction. This keeps the time accurate without over-winding my watches.

I have a large (44mm) Hamilton X-Wind with a traditional leather band and an IWC Portuguese (42mm) with a deployment clasp.

I recommend this product.

1/12/2015 update: I sadly will be retuning this watch winder as the Hamilton X-Wind is too large for this winder.  The plastic puck that you strap your watch to is unable to seat properly into the winder, so it pops and snaps on each rotation.  This is too loud for bedroom use, which is where I have my winder.  This unit worked perfectly for my slimer/lighter IWC.  Again, this winder is not for large/bulky/heavy watches similar to a Hamilton X-Wind.","Fits small/medium watches well, NO large watches"

neutral,3.0,"I got these primarily for travel (Europe in a week, but just in general)--something that wasn't a touristy sneaker but that had some support still. I  bought them in store and they were my first pair of Clarks.

They're solid shoes but, after wearing them all weekend--the salesperson said they came with a 30-day guarantee and I could wear them outside, get them dirty, etc. and still return them--I am indeed returning them.

My first instinct about these was that they looked too much like hiking boots and also looked heavy, and I wish I had listened to my instinct because both are true! They felt comfy in the store but even after a short walk with my dog later that day, I realized the insoles weren't very cushioned at all and there is little to no arch support (I have slightly high arches but nothing serious--I don't wear orthodics or have a foot condition or anything). I asked the sales guy about insoles and he said you can put your own in, but that changes the support/wave motion of the shoe. Well, there's no way the insoles are cushioned or supportive enough for me, so I'd definitely have to put my own insoles in. Then, there is the stiffness and heaviness. I like that they're durable and waterproof but it's at the cost of feeling like a hiking shoe (not uncomfortable in the sense of blisters but just not something your feet would enjoy being in all day). They're also very heavy--while walking my dog, I could hear the shoes thudding on the pavement. For travel, I want a shoe that's light enough to pack and also to wear all day. I don't want a hiking boot that makes me stomp around and makes my foot feel imprisoned and stiff.

Even style-wise, I'm less happy with these the more I look at them. As I said, they look rugged and utilitarian. I'm all about comfort over style, but for this much money, I don't want to look like I'm going camping when I'm out exploring European cities. I got them in gray which is a nice color but they still looked very hiking boots-ish. It's nice they come with two different colors of shoelace but still (btw, only certain colors come with two shoelaces).

I will say that these seem well-constructed and Clarks' return policy for these is excellent--not sure if it applies on Amazon, so consider buying these in the store. My main complaint about these is the insole/cushioning. I don't have freakishly high arches or anything, but I do need support, and these have almost none. I could put arch supports on top of the insoles like some reviewers did, but I tried that and it felt bulky--plus, if I'm going to basically re-do the entire cushioning system of the insole, why spend all this money. I have sneakers and even hiking boots already at home--I got these because the ""wave technology"" was supposed to have cushioning and support and be easy on your feet while walking. These are actually less supportive than my sneakers or my hiking boots and have almost no cushioning. They may work for you if you need minimal cushioning and don't need arch support--otherwise, you will probably be buying your own insoles--and at that point, why bother with these expensive shoes? Might as well buy a solid mid-range pair with decent construction and then get your own insoles if needed.

it's also worth noting, as other reviewers have said, that these aren't true hiking/trek sneakers (not enough ankle support for serious hiking). So if you're looking for something that can work in cities and ""off road,"" maybe look for a more dedicated hiking boot.

Clarks seems to be high quality but these shoes are too uncomfortable, stiff, and unsupportive to keep for me.","Stiff, not enough support/cushion"
neutral,3.0,"Thin and light. Any thinner and it would be sheer see-through. Good top for hot sunny weather or as a base layer in cooler climates. I live in Florida where  the sun sizzles any bare skin. This provides SPF 25 which is at least some arm protection and handles moisture far better than any cotton tee. Sleeves are way too long. Perhaps they are cut so one can hold them down while applying a 2nd long sleeved garment, or they are designed to cuff over a second top. Hard to say. Also, the torso length is about an inch shorter than an average tee. Kind of a strange fit. If you wear in tucked in it easily pulls out and if you wear it outer it rides up to expose your middle when you bend over. I have to cuff up the sleeves about 3 inches. I think this model is being phased out and we're seeing the last of what colors and sizes are left. I believe there is a newer version of this top that perhaps doesn't have these flaws. Also, it's priced a little high for a close-out product, if that's what this is.","Synthetic material, phased out design, made in Sri Lanka"

neutral,3.0,"Similar to drugstore sunglasses, though maybe with better UV protection. The plastic feels cheap, the fit is so-so, and the temples/earpieces are uncomfortable. Without nose-pads, they also slide down my face.

They may be ""large"" versus children's or women's glasses, but wearing them, I had large gaps to the sides, and smaller gaps at the top. Much worse coverage than wrap-around sunglasses. The temples/earpieces sit poorly: a little tight, and not very comfortably. And they look awkward on my oblong/largish male face. Not good since the look I'm going for isn't usually ""those aren't really your sunglasses, are they? and they look cheap"".

Objectively, they are not terrible for the price in terms of UV protection and materials. But also, they are not very comfortable, and decidedly unflattering for my facial structure-- not something I'm likely to wear, so back they go.

I only award 3 stars because they're 10 bucks and have good UV protection (and a carry-bag), cheaper than most of what I could get at local B&M. Recommended only if you have a small/round (probably female) face.","so-so, which is about right for the price"

neutral,3.0,"The watch works as a real cellphone (without any smartphone).
This was the main reason I was looking for such a watch/cell-phone.
Unlike expensive iWatch which needs expensive iPhone this one can perform as stand alone cell phone.
And the price is unbelievable ($36 right now on Amazon).
I inserted my T-Mobile SIM card from existing phone and the watch immediately started working as cell phone without any extra settings.
I did cut T-Mobile standard SIM card to the size of micro SIM to fit into the watch (to do so I searched the web for SIM cutting template, printed it and cut my card to the proper size).
It was also easy to connect the watch to my car BlueTooth handsfree system.
Using if for more than a month and pretty happy with it.
The 4-star rating (I would give 4.5-star if possible) is due to battery life.
You should charge the battery every day even if you do not talk on the phone.

Thanks to other reviewers, I ordered two sizes up [I wear 32"", but got 36""], and I agree that's the best idea -- a 34"" would have ""worked"" for me, but the extra length is comfortable, and the tab looks better. Actually, I'm surprised at how much a 2"" belt [instead of 1-1/2""] improves the fit - and the appearance! - of my 501s. Highly recommended!
14 Dec 2016: This is a follow-up to my original review, which WAS five stars. I wear this belt nearly every day, and it shows practically no sign of damage of any sort around the holes. It's thick yet flexible, and has remained black. HOWEVER, my husband just ordered one, and it is notably thinner, and has a shiny finish instead of matte. He's not sending it back, but the pronounced deterioration of quality is disappointing.

""TOXIC"" is a NON-PROBLEM: I used to live in California, so I know that the toxic warning label is a by-product of CA's *extreme* PC attitude.

I thought my toes may feel squeezed because they do appear narrow to the eye, but they're not.  Must be the cosmetic designing.  They're a cool looking shoe.

 After having this robe a while I thought I would come back and update my review. As other reviewers have noticed it does snag really easy. I was brushing my hair and the brush bristles hooked on the loops and they unraveled. My pomeranian put her paws on my leg and they unraveled. The sleeves have gotten snagged on things and they unravel. You get the picture I guess. This is a really nice warm robe but it won't look very nice if you wear it much unless you just sit there in a nice soft chair with your feet up.

So I figured I needed a size up. The 38C was HUGE! I returned it. I found some other sports bras by Champion that are awesome and run a little more true to size.

On the peru color it was only 25"" long in center and dropped to about 29"" on edge.  The overall blouse was at least an inch shorter on the sleeves as well as width of tee was an inch smaller on each side.  So it is a crap shoot on what size and length you will get.  I may return the Peru color for another color just to see if I get lucky and get a longer one to wear with leggings.  This is a thin jersey silk type tee.

UPDATE: I've come to like this hat more and more, however, as I've worn it through most of the hot weather of summer, the color on the front of the bill has started to fade. At first I thought it was just getting dirty/dusty from my fingers putting the hat on, and taking it off, but I've washed the bill with sprayed plain water, and it's definitely losing its color.

neutral,3.0,"I had been pining after these boots for a very long time and decided to finally bite the bullet and order them. In terms of quality, they are (mostly) outstanding. The leather and soles are solid in every way.

In terms of comfort, I agree with most other reviewers in that they are a bit stiff at first but do start breaking in as you wear them.

As for sizing, they are definitely true to size. I'm a solid 8.5 and they fit perfectly (with a regular and also a thicker sock).

Only thing is that I couldn't ignore a nagging sensation in the heel of my left boot... sure enough, when I pushed down with my fingers, I could feel a nail poking through. Darn it. I really wanted to keep and love these boots but it seems to me that if I'm going to pay this much for a quality boot, that I should have received a quality boot.

They'll be sent back shortly... thankfully Amazon has an amazing return policy. I may risk buying another Frye product again, but I'm a bit skeptical. At the same time, it's hard to ignore the other (very positive) reviews.","Pining, pining... gone. But, forever? I may have to give Frye another chance."
neutral,3.0,"I guess 3 out of 5 is not bad, but it's not enough to motivate me to buy this set again.  I might, however, buy a few of the items separately.  The products are made of good ingredients, most of them natural and organic.  Organic fruit acid complex, peptides, DMAE, alpha lipoic acid, Vitamin C and CoQ10 are some of the ingredients and you will *not"" find parabens, petroleum, propylene or butylene glycol, sodium lauryl sulfates, pesticides, phthalates, artificial dyes or fragrances. And the products are not tested on animals.  All this is a big plus in beauty products.

Now as to what's in this kit:

1) 2 oz. Green Apple cleansing gel.  This is a very runny gel so you must be careful when squeezing the tube not to get out too much or have it run away from you.  As for its effectiveness, it seems to work OK. It has a foaming action and the skin feels clean after use, but mine also feels a bit dry.  But then, that's why there are moisturizers.

2)  .5 oz. Green Apple peel, full strength.  Another OK product.  Apply to your face and leave on for 10 minutes, rinse off, and there is a definite exfoliation effect without excessive harshness.  As with the cleaning gel, I also found this to be a bit drying.

3)  .25 oz. Green Apple Age Defy serum.  This is also OK but, unlike some other serums I have used on my skin, this one dries my skin somewhat.  Again, there are moisturizers included in the kit so no big deal.  However, the moisturizers included here are the two products of the kit that I do not like.

4)  .5 oz. Green Apple SPF15 moisturizer.  This is for day use.  It moisturizes and protects (somewhat) from the sun.

5)  .5 oz. Green Apple Age Defy moisturizer.  No sun protection.  This is for your nighttime moisturizing treatment.

Of the 5 products listed above, the two I did not care for are the moisturizers.  They left my skin feeling like it couldn't breathe properly, and that was even when I used just a small amount.  I am used to clear serums and oils, such as rosehips seed oil, and like the way those moisturize and absorb into the skin much better than these two Green Apple products do.

So my bottom-line opinion is that this kit is not a necessary addition to my bathroom cabinet.  I'm happy enough with the peel but am just as happy with a good scrub product.  And as for the moisturizers here, they're a ""No, thank you, I have my own favorites already.""

neutral,3.0,"Individually I like the manicure tools in this set.  The metal is high quality, the finish is beautiful, and they feel sturdy and well-balanced in my hand.  The nail clippers are sharp and worked well on both my finger and toe nails.  The cuticle tool is two in one.  It works both to push the cuticles back and to remove stuff from under the nails.  The tweezers is amazing; it can pluck out even the shortest hairs (although I do wish it was a little longer).  But the nail file was a big miss for me.  I found both sides of the file a little too coarse for my needs.  My fingernails are thin and tend to flake, so the coarse grit of the file just ripped my nails instead of smoothing them.  And the scissor In all honesty Im a little intimidated by the scissor.  It is wicked looking.  It is super pointy and super sharp, and in my klutzy hands it is a disaster waiting to happen.

But my biggest issue with the set it the ash wood box that holds all the tools.  The box is attractive and well made, but the thing does not open for cleaning.  The metal top is glued to the tall wooden box, and there are holes in the metal sized to fit the five different tools.  There is also a spongy thing at the bottom of the box to keep the longer tools from hitting the base and getting damaged.  Im not a germaphobe or overly afraid of bugs, but two seconds after realizing the top wasn't removable I started to wonder what was lurking in that dark, airless box.  Bacteria, mold, mildew, spiders, termites.  Anyone else live in fear of spring time termite swarms?  Those bugs go everywhere and get into anything.  I really, really wish the top was removable.

So all the items in the set are high quality and attractive, but I will only end up using half the items in the set.  Given the price, make sure you can use all the pieces before you make a purchase.","I like the individual tools but not the set  also, ash wood box can't be opened for cleaning"

neutral,3.0,"I think overall the costume is cute and sexy for how cheap it was. I was a little disappointed in sizing...Since there was no size to choose from I assumed it was ""one size fits most"" but the packaging size is labeled petite/small. I am 5'6 in between a small and medium ( size 4/6) with most of my weight on lower body. The material is stretchy so it fits.. I plan on using the wrap to hide the torso area where there is no breathing room or extra stretch/ruffles which I would have liked. This reason (the sizing) is why I give it a 3/5. I plan on keeping it as a safety but I ordered a completely different costume just to compare.
*************************************
UPDATE as of November 6, 2015: I now see that the advertised item is depicted with the Sizing - ""SMALL"". Good idea..

Glad they have updated this and provided this information!",Not one size fits all

neutral,3.0,"This one is a bit large in the cup. Otherwise, I like it fine. I will keep it.",Playtex 18 Hour Comfort
neutral,3.0,"I am a little torn....On one hand, the fabric is a decent quality and they are very comfortable to wear. On the other hand, detail of the print is very poor (I think because of the fabric type) and the shiny nature of the fabric highlights every bump and ripple. Let me go into more detail:

FABRIC:
- good, medium weight, very shiny
- Lycra or spandex (exactly like bathing suit material or 1980's workout suits)
- 4 way stretch (stretches in all directions) that has LOTS of stretchiness...easily to twice its size

STITCHING:
- Thread is very weak. These did not fit tight on me and after trying them on there are broken threads in the seams, that will need to be RE-STITCHED.
- This seems to be consistent with all the pairs of Chinese printed leggings I have bought on Amazon in the last month.

PRINTING:
- Very muddled. I did notice that the seller I purchased from (Sunnydate) has 2 versions of this same design. One version, you can see the detail of brush strokes and streaks of oil paint, the way it forms waves like icing on a cake. The version I received does not have any clear detail, and the lines are all blurred.
- This is my third pair of printed leggings....the other two designs I bought, Gustav Klimpt 'The Kiss' & Robot Skeleton, they both were MUCH more clean lined and clear. Those two have subtle shading and very fine line details.

THE FIT:
- Nice long waist, no plumber crack on a full butt and thighs.
- Very stretchy, will fit a more ""average"" size American woman

My measurements, for reference...
- Waist : 26""
- Hips at Widest: 38""
- Around thigh at widest: 21""
- Height 5' 2""

From reading other reviews, it sounds like there are a couple different versions of these being sold under the same heading. Keep that in mind when ordering.",To love OR not to love....sigh

neutral,3.0,So I'm giving this 3 stars because it runs so small. I bought an xxl after reading the reviews and it fits perfect with flow. It is so cute! If I didn't read the reviews I would have given it 1 star for being too small. I normally wear a large in flowier tops.,Runs small! By 2 sizes
neutral,3.0,Got this for my daughter that wears a medium in everything and other reviewers sounded like it fits as expected but it actually is a bit on the small side. It is a little bit tight on her chest and stomach area but arm length is slightly long.

So it is what it is I just hope the seems hold up because it is so tight.,Medium is a bit small for my daughter

neutral,3.0,"I was looking for a casual watch to wear when not working so I could minimize the wear and tear to my more professional / expenisve work watch.  I saw this watch at a large national retailer recently for only $30 so I decided to take a gamble on it.  I haven't owned it long enough to tell you how it will hold up.  Overall, I like it so far.  Personally, I think it may look better without the white Tachymeter writing on the bezel, but that is justmy opinion.  It is a casual watch and I do feel a little bit like I am wearing a high school kids watch given the appearance.  That being said it seems like a decent casual watch.  The hands / dial of the watch glow for a very short time when exposed to light, but the indiglo feature is great.  The watch looks really cool when the outline of all the dials and hands are lit up in the dark.  If you don't have good eye site (or glasses) the dials will be hard to read.  They are functional, but for me more decorative.  I won't use the features of the watch other than telling time, date, indiglo.  I may use the alarm, but it isn't likely.  I think the watch is a decent size.  The leather band is thick but I found it comfortable.  Again, to me it is a more casual or sport watch... a little but of a youth watch, but I still kind of like it.  If you can find this watch for under $45 then I say go for it.","If you buy it at the right price, then go for it.  Very casual, sporty and somewhat of a youth watch in appearance. (IMHO)"

I didn't have time to send it back, so I mended it the best I could. They were both very wrinkled, but you have to expect that from any costume like this that comes in a box. I used a steamer to steam out the wrinkles, and they looked very nice once I was done. I am not sure how other people have gotten the hats to stay on, but I wound up sewing them to headbands. There really is nothing on the hat to help pin it in your hair. For what I paid, I was okay with the costumes. My daughters looked adorable in them when all was said and done.",Overall Okay
neutral,3.0,"I wanted a tote / purse that would be nice to carry extra items.  This is sort of a cross between a large purse and a small tote.

This is a lightweight, thin bag that has a somewhat leather-like feel to it.  It has a texture with bumps on it.  I do like that it zips up, which is a must for my bags.

The end of the zipper is not attached to the bag, so if the zipper pull is near the end, you have to use a hand to hold the end of the zipper and then pull on the zipper pull, which is not the easiest design.  Also once you have zipped the bag, there is a strap that crosses over the top of the bag and slips in the middle of the metal ""H"".  I wish instead this was just a magnetic closure, as it is too much work to do two enclosures with two hands.

The bag is nice to have for extra items when I don't want to use a regular grocery store tote bag or that kind of thing.  This isn't a heavy duty bag, so I would save it for lightweight items, maybe a book, microfiber towel, that kind of thing.

I received this bag in exchange for my honest review.",Purse/tote size bag for light items

I tried to wear it about mid point upper chest area and the top string would not lay flat. The resin beads would flip over. I would say the last 25% of the extension part of the chain will keep the necklace from laying flat. I think because it's so wide it can't go too far down the chest without buckeling.

I took this to England and quickly discovered two things: one, the 30l stated capacity is misleading as they include the theoretical capacity of every pocket in that, you will only get 1000 cu inches or 16 liters in the main pouch, and two, the numerous external pockets(and ultra! American styling) were the honey to pickpocket bees everywhere I went(Waterloo station was the worst.)

In the air, as a single carry on travel bag, its' nemesis is weight limits. I could have gotten all my stuff in it but AirNZ limits bags to 28lbs. it held 34 easily.

Not for me.  I was in St. Maarten and they gave me a great little box about 4x4 that held my pendant, earrings, and ring.  I then circled the bracelet around the edge of the box.

neutral,3.0,"I got this watch and it looks great and kept perfect time for about three days.  The chronograph functions all worked correctly during those three days.  On the fourth day, I noticed that when using the timing function, the second hand didn't return to the 12 o'clock reference position when reset.  I tried following the directions in the manual to reset the reference position to 12 o'clock, but nothing happened.  It now comes back to slightly past 6 o'clock when reset.  The fact that they have a procedure for reseting the reference point suggests this might be a common problem.  The watch does still keep time well, but I use the stopwatch function a several times a day and need it to work.

Called the factory and they said it needed to come back to them for adjustment.  They didn't even verify that I had tried the procedure in the manual for resetting the reference point. As is the case with most customer? service centers these days, I could hardly understand the person on the phone and he wasn't any help.  I decided to return the watch instead of trusting the service people to fix it. If they are going to put timing functions on a watch they should work longer than three days.easy a

neutral,3.0,"This shoe will be alright for those used to padded zero drop shoes, but for those used to no padding at all it feels like too much.
The toes box shape is nice and wide, but the toe box overly tall in size 15, which fit my 14 foot. I could wear heavy wool socks in there and it still would be too tall for my feet.

Also because the bottom is not flat it inhibits feeling the road with your toes. So while the shoe is technically zero drop, it's not really in application as the front portion is tapered. This is the same on all of the so called zero drop padded running shoes.

neutral,3.0,"In general, I like this bra, although it's not quite as supportive as I had hoped. It feels like the fabric gives a bit as the day wears on, and I wind up needing to tighten it to get the same support in the afternoon as I got in the morning. This also means the garment needs to be washed after every wearing, which I hate to do with bras (I'm guessing most women would agree).

The bra is quite comfortable, however, and I appreciate the seamless structure and smooth fabric. It does hold sweat a bit more than all-nylon bras do, though, so not a great choice on a hot, muggy day. It's a bit of a full-figured bra, so it's not going to look great under anything really sheer--keep that in mind.

neutral,3.0,"This Lucien Piccard Men's watch is very nice looking. It comes in a gorgeous and well made gift box. It has a classic and timeless look, it has gold, but not too much, and it has a genuine leather band. Unfortunately, there is a ""deployment clasp"" at the end of that gorgeous leather band that is a deal breaker and makes this watch unviable for everyday wear.

When the watch arrived, my Husband and myself were both pretty impressed with it. It was even nicer looking in person than in the pictures. My Husband immediately went to try it on. Then he said, ""What? I don't understand."" This made me stop what I was doing and come look because my Husband is the type of guy that figures everything out easily...especially mechanical issues. He showed me the clasp and I was confused too. We looked at the small instruction booklet and did not see anything about the clasp. After about 5-10 more minutes of tinkering with it, my Husband figured it out.

The clasp is a real pain to use. If you have a small wrist, you may be able to keep the clasp on the opposite end and save some time. However, my Husband has a large wrist. He has to take it completely apart every time. He also showed me how he has to ""guess"" which hole is right each time since you don't know if you have it right until it is all the way fastened. This is hard to understand without actually seeing the watch in action, but trust me that it is not worth your time. Even with my Husband knowing how to work the watch, it takes several minutes to put on. He will wear this watch occasionally, but it will be rare. He needs a watch that goes on in seconds, not minutes.

While this watch would probably get 5 stars without the clasp, the clasp will be a deal-breaker for most people. I do not recommend this watch. There are much more user friendly watches out there.",The deployment clasp is hard to figure out and time consuming to use

neutral,3.0,"I ordered relatively inexpensive extra-large, long-sleeved T-shirts from Hanes, Gildan, and Soffe. All purchases were Amazon. I wanted a shirt to serve as a sleep shirt to pair with miscellaneous bottoms.

1. Washing. All three shirts needed two washings and dryings (med heat) to become reasonably soft and lose their chemical odor.

2. Country of origin: Two shirts are made in El Salvador, one in Honduras.

3. Neck label: Hanes had printed-on-cloth label; others had tags.

4. Sizing: Hanes was baggier and 1 inch longer than the other two. The extra length is good, at least for sleeping.

5. Texture: Soffe and Gildan had identical, somewhat stiff texture compared to the Hanes.

6. Cuffs: All cuffs were reasonably tight.

Conclusion: If you are simply looking for sleeping comfort, probably go with Hanes--though currently at $10.41 the most expensive of the three. If you are wearing the shirt out in the world, and aren't overweight and no taller than six feet, the fit is a little better with either Soffe or Gildan.

I already have black boots that are the same circumference and look too similar to keep these.  I really wish they were skinnier.  Like I said, they are simply gorgeous.

neutral,3.0,"I've worn only Birks for the past couple of decades. I wear Birks, Papillo, and Betula, cheap to expensive.  These are cheap. Flimsy, very flexible sole, all plastic/rubber man-made.  Feet don't breath in these and start to sweat the minute I put them on, even under the top strap. My foot angles kind of strange in this foot-bed; toes leaning towards the sides of the shoes instead of being held towards the front...hard to explain. It's like the foot-bed near the toes are angled inward so my toes angle sidewards. Not very comfortable for Birkis since my feet are accustomed to wearing anew pair right out of the box with comfort...not so with this pair. I'll try walking in them to hopefully have them adjust to my foot shape.  The good thing about these is you can wear them at the beach, in water, mud, what-ever and rinse them off. Good throw on shoes for when you don't care about wrecking them.

ETA: Sent this pair back and ordered one size larger (which I never had to do in all the Birks I've bought).  This larger size still has a some-what funky fit, a tad too long, but at least I can wear them around the house or going out in rain or mud.

neutral,3.0,"This oil and emulsifier based cleanser removes all traces of makeup and does not leave skin feeling stripped.  It is an impressive makeup remover.

I have issues with the aesthetics, though.  The first time I used it, I kept wondering when it would start to foam because it felt like I was still rubbing oil and water on my skin.  I finally opened my eyes and glanced in the mirror to find it was indeed foaming.  I can't feel it changing on my face or with my fingertips.  I've used it a good two weeks now, and that hasn't changed.  I know that after I add water, it will start foaming, but I can't tell when that happens.  It is impossible to rinse off unless I use a washcloth.  I can see the makeup is gone, but water beads up on my face.  I appreciate the softness, but I really don't like leaving cleanser on my face, so I scrape it off with a wash cloth.

Yesterday, I noticed the ""Safe For"" symbol on the back of the bottle.  This symbol looks like a jar, and has a number followed by the letter ""M"".  This symbol is not on all cosmetic and personal care consumables, but I find it more and more often.

I later spot the chain a couple of rooms away.  It had broken, right next to the loop that the clasp grabs.  I can't use it anymore.  It's a necklace I'll truly miss.

neutral,3.0,"I may not be accurately reflect the price into consideration for my evaluation.

First, the service was very good, and the seller answered all my questions promptly.  Thus, I have no complains there.  Second, the delivery was fast and no issue there either.  And third, I received what I ordered.

The issue I have is the quality of the stones.  I own 1 carat ring & necklace (H, VS1).  I need a matching earrings, and I heard earrings do not have to be high quality as they are not looked at up close.  Thus, I went for these set.  What I did not realize was that I1 diamond does not reflect lights very well due to impurities in them.  Although one cannot see too well if the diamonds have impurities in them or not unless up close, but I can tell right away if I see them under sunlight.  Even when I clean them thoroughly, they look rather dull.  They do not sparkle as my ring or necklace.  As I bought 1 1/2 carat, they are noticeable.

I am not saying it is bad for the price.  I saw 1 carat earrings (I, VS2) about the same price as 1 1/2 (H, I1).  If I started over, I would go for a smaller ones with higher quality as jewelries need to sparkle with lights.  But it is just my preference.  Some might prefer bigger stones.

Basically, I am saying I got what I paid for.

Lastly, I would have gone with yellow-gold rather than white-gold.  I1 diamond in white-gold look just like sterling silver imitation.",Fair Earrings

neutral,3.0,"I define a wind breaker as a light outer jacket that stops the wind and maybe some light rain from getting through. It seems like most stores do the same. This, however, is not that; it's a heavy, completely non-breathable polyester shell. It's got mesh on the inside, though I don't know why, because there's nowhere to wick sweat too, it just saturates. For cold-weather activities, where you will be wearing several layers, I imagine this would be a very good outer layer, most certainly keeping out all but the most stubborn rainstorms and raging winds. But I needed a windbreaker for warm-weather activities in case of a sudden squall or the wind picked up (l hike in the mountains) and this was suffocating and, after a few minutes, soaking wet with my sweat on the inside. It's not a bad jacket, but it should be listed as a shell, not a windbreaker.

Two odd things: they are still fairly comfortable; and, even though a bit large once on, they are a bit tight to actually put on, due to the way the tongue catches on my foot.

neutral,3.0,"Looks cute, but honestly didn't love it. I think I would have liked it better without the lace, as the top is flattering. The lace doesn't really separate in the midline unless you are wider (and definitely wider than the model) and it looks like a cover-up with the slit straight up the middle to your crotch, which is not a flattering look on most people (see attached pic as proof). It's definitely a PUSH-UP top, so if you don't need the push-up, beware. If you have next to nothing, this will flatter you well. It also fits well and won't fall off if you were to jump into a pool or something. I'm too pale to pull it off, and just look washed up and it didn't lay right on me.  Not worth returning, but wouldn't have bought it in a store if I had tried it on. I wore it half a day on vacation and then haven't worn it since.

The most dominant color is the rose.  The metal is not smooth and highly polished. It has a granulated Etruscan look....much like the texture in photo.

 They're not misrepresented, I made the bad choice. I prefer highly polished metals. This metal is not polished, except for the borders.  The surface has a rough feel, but the metal next to the ears is smooth and comfortable. That area is also very well plated.  These earrings are encrusted with stones; something I thought would be very attractive, but it's too much for my liking. I think less would have been better.

They're not as pretty as I thought they would be; however, they are well made. The stones are not glued in. They are bead set. The earrings are cast from solid silver and for their size, have good weight to them. The backs of earrings are not hollowed out. The post are solid and the backs fit securely. The posts are located near the top of earrings. The stones are sparkling and twinkle a lot, especially in good lighting. The earrings are the size of a dime. These sit upright on the ears.

neutral,3.0,"I ordered this set months ago but my anticipated travel fell through. The luggage sat unopened in the shipping box until another trip transpired; when I finally opened it I gotta say it was a letdown. I simply cannot imagine ever having to check this bag...not sure it could handle a carousel and baggage handling. The fabric is tremendously thin. A child could probably slice thru it with a pair of safety scissors. Seeing as how I take the train more than fly, this set will work for me only due to Amtrak's liberal carry-on policy. But for airlines? No way. The zippers are flimsy and the overal bag structure is more floppy than sturdy. The pull out handles do seem well done, nice action. I purchased this mainly for the polka dots as it stands out nicely making it easier to find. Another reviewer helpfully suggested putting cardboard inside by the lining and frankly, that's almost neccessary. If you prefer your luggage less DIY and more out of the box sturdy, I'd skip this. For light car or train trips when several pieces are better than one big bag or if you never need to check it, this could work. However, doublecheck the measurements!! The very largest case is still quite small at 28in. Antrak allows 36in checked bags and with airlines charging per piece for checked bags, why not get more room for your money? With the whimsical pattern and incredibly lightweight material, this is more suited for older kids off to grandma's for the summer.",Quantity over quality and CHECK THE DIMENSIONS

I have been on Brooks Addiction 10's for over the last year and finally got back into some competition (I did a sprint distance Triathlon last Sept).  I'm in mid training for a half-marathon and I'm averaging 20-25 miles per week.

I've been switching back and forth between my Addiction10 and these Spria Scorpius shoes trying very hard to figure out if they're going to work for me.

Well, the verdict is in.

Given my feet, these shoes just don't work well for a long-distance runner for me.

The fit across the top forefoot is too loose and doesn't provide me the adequate support I need.

I'm an 8.5 US with a standard width and the Scorpius in the medium width is just too wide.

The overall construction is mediocre, some of the detail patterns and leather don't appear to be in accordance to patter, an example is one of the shoelace eyelets is sewn on cockeyed...

Anyhow, I had to give these a try based on some reviews I read elsewhere, the cost compared to the Addiction10 I was running in was intriguing but I should have saved my money and stuck with what I knew worked.",Not horrible - But not that great

The boots fit OK, seemed well constructed and to fit to size around the foot.  The zipper quality seemed fine.  As a few others commented, the top of the boot at the ankle is a bit tight, but it was OK for me.  My problem with the boots was the outer sole.  When I walked in these, they felt a bit awkwardly angled, and they ""clomped"" loudly on the floor.  I think it was caused by combination of a higher heel, and a sole material that seemed more like a plastic than rubber.  Surely it's not actually plastic, but the feel and sound of walking in them was not something I wanted.","An OK boot, but I had a couple issues with it."

Meaning that you should order a half size smaller than usual. I normally wear a 10.5 to an 11. I ordered a size 10 and they fit good. I think they are so roomy because of a lack of padding.

neutral,3.0,"I was looking for a closed toe adventure type sandal that would be great for casual wear and hiking on nicer trails in warm weather. So this shoe looked like the perfect one. But it wasn't!
There was a lot to like about this shoe: really cute, makes large feet look smaller, a lot of micro-adjustments, great traction, large toe box and it was lightweight. Unfortunately, I decided to send these sandals back. I found that the insole had a plasticy feel and a hard ridgeline under where the toes meet the rest of the foot, but the real reason I sent them back was the diagonal straps which crossover the ball of the feet were painful. And, I wasn't sure they would stretch with time. If you notice the way the shoe is designed it seems to lift upwards in the toe area, when you put these on, the toe area flattens out increasing the tension in those diagonal straps. If they had been designed with a flatter sole this would not have been a problem as there would have been enough slack to account for actual wearing. I'm not sure if this would be a problem for everyone but it was for me. BTW, I have long slender feet.",Really wanted to love them!

They say they are unisex and I bought them for my husband but think that the lenses are a bit close together for a man's face.

Mostly though I was disappointed that the color does not match what I thought I was getting. The color was labeled ""blue"" so I guess that is just the color.

neutral,3.0,"The photos of the interior of this bag leave out one important detail. It is not evident from the pictures how your suits or any hanging items are affixed to the top lid of the suitcase and folded up. The loop for the hangers is in absolutely the wrong position. It is opposite of where it should be, making it very difficult to load first of all. You have to lay the suitcase flat on a bed or on the floor. You cannot tilted up on a luggage rack at home or in a hotel and properly load any hanging items. The loop should be at the ""top"" of the lid closest when closed to the front and the carrying handle of the suitcase. Since I carry suits almost always when I travel this makes this suitcase very inconvenient and I am very sad that I purchased it.

That is the only reason. It is well constructed, roles easily and has a nice solid handle with good ergonomics.

MY ORIGINAL REVIEW
The Kronen & Sohne Black Retro Pocket Watch is a really neat little watch  in the interest of honesty I must tell you I was given mine for Christmas, and therefore I suppose I am prone to treasure it beyond its actual commercial value. Even so, I believe I can be honest.

It is physically striking: its etched black surface is very ornate, even busy. Personally, though, I like it: it seems as if it is the type of watch I would find, say, in a cigar box within a footlocker full of my grandfathers belongings. In this world of electronic and digital devices, here is a throwback: a wind-up clock with ornate symbols etched all over it. Like an orrery of the physical universe, it is a seemingly antiqued gear-driven timepiece that is as much a working clock as it is a piece of memorabilia.

But does it work? Simply put, yes  if you pay attention to winding it every morning. Ive only owned mine for a week and a day, and my first three days did not go well, as I found that I needed to retrain myself to follow a daily routine with it. But since I followed a certain regimen I wind it when I I take it out in the morning and when I put it down at night  its been keeping perfect time. Granted, thats only four days, but its worked fine nonetheless.

But getting back to its looks, I must say I really love it. Im a steampunk reader who isn't maniacal about it  I haven't gone out and bought any old Dickensian clothes or anything, but I do admire the throwback quality of it all, the fun of a neat gear-driven device like this. I love the glass window, the hinged door, the visible gearwork one can see through the back, the blue-tinged etchingtheres something lovely and antiquated about it all. The clock works fine for me, and I really enjoy its physical  attractiveness. As to its duration, only time will tell. If you read nothing else after this sentence, its still working fine.",I Loved This Timepiece -- but it's STOPPED

neutral,3.0,"I love the Ariat brand and I love turquoise, so I was excited to order this belt.  I wear a size 12 jeans and the large belt fit perfectly.  The buckle is solid and it fits into the belt hole with a straight piece of metal that has a ball at the end.  The ball is large enough that the buckle feels secure and not like it's going to pop open while I'm wearing it.  The colors looked the same in person as they did on my computer, and the turquoise seems like it's not going to fall out any time soon.

As much as I love how the buckle looks, it sticks out pretty far, and more on one side than the other.  When I wear it with a longer shirt, it looks like I have a huge circle sticking out from my abdomen.  I wear a lot of these style belt buckles, and none of them stick out as far as this one.  If you're planning on wearing a shirt that's shorter in the front to show off the belt, this will be a non-issue.

This holds the sides up much better and I can still unattach it if I need to get to something on the outside of the organizer.

neutral,3.0,"Note: I love my shoes and my boots.  And I will try anything in fashion once.

I got these in the hunter green and the coloring was gorgeous.  I slipped them on and they fit okay, but they hurt the soles of my feet!  The design of the boot is nice- slouchy, relaxed- great to be paired with rolled up jeans and/or a lazy skirt... presumably.

STYLE:
- the boot came up mid calf.  I have long legs (36"" inseam), but I've found a few pairs of boots that reach my knees at least.  These came up to mid calf, which had a way of cutting my long legs in half, making me look awkward.  I tried to pull up the ""foldover"" part of the boot and even with that up, they still barely reached the bottom of my knee cap.
- The slouchy design is wicked cute.  I wished these fit me right.
- the rounded toe and the flat foot paired with the slanted rise of the front of the shoe for the top of you foot, makes the shoe look like an elf shoe.  (especially in the green color, unfortunately.  I maybe should have picked a different color for my first Steve Madden flat boots)

COMFORT:
- the sole of the boot is really hard.  The foot casing cuts into the backs of my heels/ ankles.
- I ordered a size 8 (which is my typical sneaker size) and they were a little big for me.  If you're borderline sizes, order down.
- there was plenty of room for the calves, even when the top of the boot hit right in the ""meat"" of my calf muscle.
- the shoe is so flat that it actually hurts my foot.  There is no arch support whatsoever.  Could be just me, but I guess I really can't do flat boots.  If  you have high arches, these aren't the shoes for you.

SHIPPING:
5 out of 5
- I got these shoes within 3 business days during the christmas season.  I ordered on a Thursday, one WEEK before christmas, and got them on Monday, BEFORE christmas.  Fantastic. No damages to the packaging.  They were in their own little plastic sleeves, stuffed with foam and cardboard to preserve shaping.  Then they were put in a shoe box, and put into another box for shipping.  Great service.

The style of the shoe is cute.  The idea of the shoe is great.  The reality of the shoe is not so much.  I will be returning these and looking for a different style of boot.  :)","Great Quality, Lacks Style"

Where the tan work belt is incredibly thick and strong (the ""Incredible Hulk"" of belts, as far as I'm concerned), this belt isn't quite as tough, but it's a lot better looking (dare I whisper, ""Captain America?"") than it's heavy duty brother.

This belt is quite a bit darker (dark brown) than its tan cousin, and the stitching really stands out (in a good way...not in a ""don't wear those pants with that shirt sort of way""). The belt has an elegant look that belies its underlying strength. That said, the price is a little higher than I would typically pay for a belt of this design and quality. I typically go through several belts every year, and often spend $20-$25 for a belt of this caliber at big discount stores.

It's about 3/16"" thick (~4 mm), which is fairly par for the course, although I don't often get a belt that has as sleek of a design as this one. The belt thickness works with both my belt-carried tool organizer and handgun as well as other belts I own (with the exception of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tan-Leather-Work-Belt/dp/B01CDE8JPS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tan Leather Work Belt</a>). I wasn't overwhelmed with the quality of this belt, but it's not a wimp by any means. It's a good-looking work belt that should last for a while. I'll update my review when I find out just how long that ""while"" is.",It does the trick
neutral,3.0,"I received this as a gift.
The color was nice and I really liked the fabric, but even after steaming, twice, it still managed to look ""rumpled"".  Not a good look for this fabric and cut.  And I could see how it would pill fairly easily, esp along the cuff and under the arms.

One seam in the front skirt was a bit twisted, and wouldn't lay right which also helped make it look rumpled and sort of cheaply made.
Buttons were very loose and I could see them needing to be resewn rather quickly.

Sizing was odd, at least for me. I had enough room in the chest and waist that if I didn't want to use the buttons to keep the coat closed, I didn't have to, the belt did a good job holding it closed.  The shoulders and arms were a bit tight, especially for how ample the XL was in the chest and waist. I would not have been able to wear a heavy sweater under this and been able to move my arms much, certainly not to reach across to adjust a purse strap or anything, not without stressing the seams.  I do have sort of beefy arms and wide shoulders.  But I bought an XL to take that into account.  I'm 5'7 and 165lbs.  A large is my normal light jacket size and I like an XL for winter coats.

With the poor fit, the rumpled look and the less than awesome attention to detail, I decided to return it.

While they have made some strides, overall they just haven't been worth the money and value in the timepieces that Citizen had been known for. But this year, they are trying to make that up with their latest line of timepieces. This Eco-Drive BRT watch looks good, and handles well, compared some of Citizen's past Eco-Drive models like their dive watches. It has good illumination, and is very easy to tell time. Yet, what I don't like about the watch is that it feels a little too heavy around the wrist, and the orange display doesn't look as good as the green in the watch. It handles well, but more could've been done. I do do suggest you look around and see if you can find more from a Eco-Drive for the money.

neutral,3.0,"I got these to wear with a new pair of flats as I hate going sockless. I had never bought these kind of socks before, so I bought a couple different brands. Based on descriptions and reviews, I thought these would be my favorites, but in fact they were my least favorite. They were continuously slipping off my ankle and bunching up under my foot, which drove me crazy.

It may be perhaps that my feet are wider than average. I never buy wide shoes, but in looking at these socks compared to the others, they are much more narrow in the actual foot area. On the plus side, these were virtually invisible under my shoes. If your feet are smaller and more narrow they may well work beautifully. I think these would be worth trying if not showing is your number one criteria. These definitely had the lowest profile of all three brands.

In case you are wondering, I also bought Hue no-show socks. They showed just a tad, but stayed on my foot better. I also bought a pair from Target - Merona brand that stayed on perfectly, but they also came up and covered almost half of the top of my foot and so really couldn't be called no-show socks. :)",Always sliding off

neutral,3.0,"Let's start with the ingredients.  I see one review here that raves about 100% natural ingredients that he/she can feel immediately when it hits the scalp. That is not true.... far from it, in fact.  Granted, the manufacturer makes no such claim, so I don't know where this reviewer comes up with this; I assume he can read since he was able to write a review.  Ingredients are listed in order of highest content to least.  Ingredient #1 is water-it almost always is.  After that, there are 8 compounds listed that would require and advanced degree in chemistry to read, much less understand.  Then we get to the Peppermint, more chems, shea butter and such.  Not a big deal.. just clarifying.  The shampoo/conditioner is good.  It doesn't lather as much as I'm used to, which is to be expected with a combo product, especially one sans the sulfates.  It has a pleasing, not overbearing scent and I do feel a slight tingle on my scalp after massaging it in, probably due to the peppermint.  It leaves my hair shiny as advertised; my hair is relatively short so tangles are never an issue.  It doesn't take much product to clean my hair, a couple of pumps is sufficient.  I do like this quite a bit, but it is very expensive.  I use Jack Black products religiously-shampoos, shaving products, lotions, etc... and I've never been disappointed with their performance.  I'll probably stick with their regular shampoo after this bottle is exhausted, mostly because of the price point.  If money is no object, I'll say go for it.  If you are price conscious, there are alternatives available for less than half of what you'll pay for this.",Great product if you don't mind paying a premium for the name

neutral,3.0,"Did a lot of reading up on raw denim and these shrink-to-fit jeans. I bought my actual size instead of sizing up. I soaked these in hot water, let them hang dry, then I wore them while still damp. The idea is these jeans would shrink to fit everyone's unique contours.

I've seen mixed messages on washing these subsequent to the initial hot bath, but I figured they have to get washed eventually. After washing in delicate cycle and hang drying, the waist shrank significantly more than length.

The end result is these fit very snugly around the waist. The length is about as expected now (initially was long). I'd say I have fairly large calves, but the legs still seem a bit billowy. The fabric feels very dense compared to other Levi's. They look nice, and I'm starting to see some crease patterns, which I think is desirable on raw denim. I bought these about 5 months ago and waited this long - so considering the effort, I think a regular pair of 514's is probably preferable.",Does not fit as expected

The Decimal is the flip-flop variant of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sazzi-Digit-Outdoor-Hiking-Sport-Sandal/dp/B00CWWGLIY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sazzi Digit Outdoor Hiking Sport Sandal</a>, which I also own and wear.  Because the Digit runs so large, I ordered down a full size on the Decimal.  Which was the correct choice.  Although in doing so, the Decimal is pretty tight on the strap.  Time will tell if it loosens up.  Despite going down a full size from my normal shoe size, while the main footbed fits well, the toe portions (which are shaped, just as with the Digit) do stick out much further than my toes.  In my clutzy case, the toe protection is probably good for protection.

Pros: They dry really quickly, the toe posts are not at all annoying and they are very secure.
Cons: Odd sizing/shape, arch support is too aggressive (feels like a hard ball under my arch) and they take a bit more focus to slip on than single-toe-post flips.  (Still slip-on, but sometimes I have to look to line up the toes with the posts.)

So far these are my favorite flip-flops.

neutral,3.0,"It's priced well and, I think, worth the price but it's not a show stopper or anything to ""fall in love"" with. It looks just like the pictures and the outside is well (enough) crafted. The card slots are fine, I guess the cards get stuck but it's not a deal breaker.
However, the back section, where the money and coins are held, is not well made at all. There's really cheap fabric that could probably easily tear with the wrong force on it. If it were any more expensive than it is that would probably be enough to cause me to return it but since it's just $10, I would say it's worth keeping. I didn't really like the saying on it because it hardly makes sense and is really cheesy but it's small enough that you can hardly read it...which is a good or bad thing depending on how much you like the saying.
Ultimately, I think it's a good buy, if you're not concerned about high quality (at this price, that shouldn't be your top priority ha). If you like the colors and the design, it's exactly like the pictures and you will probably like it.",Not a waste of money

neutral,3.0,"I have had a pair of these for 5 months now.  They have held up well.  I generally wear them about twice a week.  They are stylish boots.  I feel that the general level of quality and workmanship in the boot doesn't quite measure up to the cost of $150.  I have many pairs of Chippewa boots and I find that for similar price points they offer a better made mid height boot.  Admittedly the Chippewas might not be as stylish as these boots, so that could account for some level of the price premium, but I just don't feel that these boots convey the level of quality to match the price.  I feel that a better price point for these is around the $80 range.","Good boot, but probably overpriced at $150"

neutral,3.0,"My last purchases were from another manufacturer and although those boots were comfortable and easy to put on/off by using the side zippers, they did not last as long as they should have.  Either poor stitching or not enough material seemed to be the cause.  This time I decided to spend 1/3 more for these boots.  They, as advertised, are very comfortable right out of the box.  So were the former boots.  These are waterproof, the others were not but that was not a big issue.  What I find interesting is that although I have worn these only 7 full days, only today was I able to pull them off using only the side zippers.  Maybe it will get easier but up to now I have had to unlace them.  I note that under the zipper is a flap that runs the entire length of the zipper.  Perhaps this makes them waterproof but sure hard to put on and take off without unlacing them.  Hopefully this problem will improve.  The former boots did not have the flap under the zipper and that enabled the boots to easily be slipped on.  The 5.11's can only be opened about 2 inches.",Zipper?

The very first time wearing it, the pocket stitching was coming undone and the zipper stitching as well. I had to take the time to sew a brand new coat. Also, the coat's pockets are pretty small (even for someone like me with small hands). Lastly, (probably the most annoying detail) is that this coat picks up EVERYTHING. Lint, hair, fuzzies and even bits of paper will find its way to cling to the coat's material. So if you have pets I do not suggest purchasing.

It's long enough to be worn with leggings, which is why I bought it. I'm 5'8, and my weight fluctuates between 140-145. The large fits me like a glove and looks beautiful. The color is gorgeous, even prettier green in person. I'm very happy with this order.",Gorgeous!

I like the black color as I purchased for France this summer as my Travex:  pants, shorts, skirts all mostly black. Anyways... I have added already a memory foam insert as my 54 year old feet would not do well without. The shoes fit well and do no slip with thin sock. I will be wearing no show travel socks as my feet do best this way. Looks to be good on wet cobblestone. Like that they are not too heavy as bringing only a lightweight backpack for 3-4 weeks. I will have my Merrells, Tevas, and these... Looks like I am set!","Cute, well made, sizing right on."

positive,5.0,"This is the most comfortable show I have ever worn.  I have heel spurs and bunions from wearing poorly fitting shoes my entire life.  These shoes are so light, it feels like your wearing nothing at all. My feet are not tiny and these shoes don't give the clown look effect that many shoes do.  I thought I wouldn't like the no laces type but it is great.  They stay on my feet and the memory foam is just so blissful.  The only drawback...memory foam is pretty much exhausted after about 3 months or so but the shoe is still quite comfy even with the foam gone. My current pair are 9 months old and not a tear, loose stitch or anything other that normal wear and tear. I am extremely rough on shoes, purchasing new ones every 3-4 months but these have held their own. I just purchased a black pair to wear inside of my steel toe over shoes for work.  I want the comfort at work that I have in my everyday life.  It means a lot to get up without having pain in my feet and this shoe gets me there.  Give them a try and see how you feel.  Don't just wear them for a day because at first they feel a little odd, not painful just not what I'm used to.  I'm probably going to order multiples in this shoe because every time I find anything I like, it ends up discontinued. My current ones will become lawn cutting shoes because they are still comfy enough for that. To sum up, freaking LOOOOVE this shoe!!!",This is the most comfortable show I have ever worn

This shirt is wider in the shoulders and is nicely fitted without pulling across the back or lower neckline opening. for broad shouldered women, the sleeves don't turn into pixie sleeves when you put it on. The shirt is longer than most sport shirts and seems tighter at the bottom because it is longer. But it does fit well.

The collar is tightly woven and doesn't lose shape.",Sports shirt for Athletic Women

I usually now wear a large, sometimes anot XL, I like to camouflage my self-consciousness.  Based on other reviews, I bought one xxl and one xxxl.  They are both flattering.  The ruching is  great tummy flattering look.  I  like the fit of the xxl the best, but will buy again in either size.  The material is light weight and thin.  A cami underneath is good for the larger size to kee the shirt more in place.  Overall a good purchase.

I wasn't expecting much given they're relatively inexpensive sandals but they are really great! super stylish and unique, not like your typical flip flops. Relatively easy on/off with the zipper.

I saw another reviewer say they looks ""star wars-y"" and I agree, in a good way!","Surprisingly comfortable, very stylish, worth the cost"
positive,4.0,"Cant say anything about the quality because ring has not been worn yet, however, this is rating based on first impressions. Ring does not come with a box, it comes in a bag. For the price, cant complain. Ring seems to be sturdy but not heavy. The curved edges are nice, seems to be comfortable the few mins my fianc wore it. However, it runs about a half size too small. He tried on rings at a big name jeweler and based on their measurements, hes a 9.5. I ordered this in a 9.5, it goes on, but its slightly snug. I will return for a 10.

Also, for people that complain about this ring chipping or breaking if you drop/slam it with force: it is supposed to! Tungsten is a hard metal which will break under pressure. Not saying youll likely to end up in a situation where youll need to have your ring removed by emergency personnels, but if you do, you want a ring thats going to break so they don't have to cut off your finger. Just saying, its something to keep in mind if you're going to wear it day in and day out.","Good ring for the price, sizing off."

I do still bounce a bit... impossible not to, but I don't feel myself bounce.  Good bra.  Buy this one, not the zipper front one.  That turned me into a very uncomfortable Madonna.  I'm returning that one; keeping this one.",Good bra. Buy this one
positive,5.0,"These socks were exactly what I was looking for in socks. I needed light-weight, low-cut or no-show socks that were cheap and available in a couple of colors. These socks claim to be no-show but I find that they show around 1cm above a sneaker. This is perfect for what I wanted but just be aware these are not exactly ""No-show"" even on size 10.5(mens) feet.

The size of the socks straight from the packaging can be seen in the photos I have attached.

Each box came with 6 pairs of socks (12 individual socks total).

White and black both fit the same and have been washed several times with no shrinkage that is noticeable.

Pros:
*light-weight--Breathes well even in California heat
*Low cost
*Cut low

Cons:
*None

Additional Considerations:
Just be aware that these socks on a size 10.5(Male US) still show a bit.

Overall: 5/5 stars (>=.5 rounds up, <.5 rounds down) => 5 stars

positive,5.0,"I love these sticky bras because I wear a lot of clothes that look best when no bra straps are visible. They are lightweight, the sticky adhesive is strong but does not hurt to take off, and the color makes it easy to hide under clothes. Please note I am reviewing this product as someone with a small chest (A/B cup); I am not sure what the fit is like or how functional these bras are for larger chested women. I have friends with larger chests that like these sorts of bras, but wear them knowing they have little support depending on the bra size. These bras function mostly for coverage and a little extra padding. This product is the best one on the market - I get at least 5-10 uses out of these bras before the sticky adhesive begins to wear off. I can then get 5-10 more uses out of them when their stickiness starts to wear out. So far, I've used this particular bra 3 times and it's still holding up very well. Some friends say that you can wash these bras and they will retain their stickiness, but I haven't had such luck. The reason I bought this bra from this seller is because some sellers advertise for lower prices, but take 30 days or more to ship because it's from Asia. This one offers Amazon Prime, so I got it in 2 days!! Overall, a great product and a lifesaver to prevent wardrobe malfunctions. The only thing (very small critique) is that the clear bag it came in was a bit cheap and had a different serial code stained on it. However, I don't even plan on using the bag so no worries :)",Quality strapless bra with great fit

positive,5.0,I bought this dress for a funeral. I was 7 months pregnant 5'2 140 lbs and bought the medium. It worked out really well. The waste part of the dress is nice and high and hits just below your breast line  so it was perfect for my baby bump! If I wasn't pregnant I would've bought a size small. The dress was really nice quality! Material is very heavy and detailed! Really a beautiful dress that seemed like it was expensive. Highly recommend!,Beautiful dress!
positive,5.0,The best baby shoes ever. Why wear socks when you can wear socks and shoes?? That never fall off? And that can be worn daily for nearly 4 months by a kicky infant and still look nearly good as new? No other article of clothing has stayed in good condition like these. Totally worth the cost!,The best baby shoes ever
positive,4.0,"This is a handy back pack. I love how it comes folded in its self, as big as a small make up bag. Easy to unfold and when you are done, it was pretty easy to fold it back up and it takes up no room! This is a great back pack for pretty much anyone or anything, kids going to school, going on a walk, hiking, using it for business stuff, carrying lunches, water. It is water proof, it is a nice nylon, you have a mesh side pocket on one side, and a zipper pocket on the other side, there is a front pocket and the main pocket, very roomy. I only found one small flaw, which isn't a big deal & diesnt interfere with anything, the mesh pocket on the side is sewn crooked, but not a big deal. It's a great back pack for the price. The straps have nylon on the back, kinda keeps it from getting to hot. Everything seems sturdy on here, zippers are sturdy strong. All the other parts that are sewn I found no problems. I definitely would recommend this. I was given this at a discount for my honest review, this is my honest review.",Good Things do come in small packages

The bottoms are very low cut in the front and back and they are very cheeky. They have a cute rouched stitching down the back. I am 5'3"" and about 115lbs. The small fit me perfectly.
The top can be a little bit confusing when you pull it out of the packaging. It does not come tied so I originally tied the top the wrong way. If the fabric for the top seems to hang straight down instead of at an angle, then you're wearing it wrong. (some of the reviews show the swim suit being worn this way.) Make sure the adjustable part for the triangle top is underneath the chest. The fabric should be hanging down from the top of the triangles.
This swim suit is very easy to adjust. It comes with padding in the top that can be removed.

positive,5.0,"Really cute comfortable shorts for me. I have never liked long ""walking shorts"" but also not into any ""daisy dukes"" either as I am now a Grandmother...just not really great. These are just right though. I also have an abdominal scar from surgeries so careful where waistbands lands on my belly. I went by the photo and bought a Medium at a discounted price in return for my trial and true feedback on these shorts. They are just right for me at 5'5"" and 105 pounds. I usually buy smalls now but with this material I was concerned there could be some shrinkage and so I got Mediums. The material is like a thin sweat shirt material and a drawstring waistband which I also like. These didn't really shrink at all and now I think these will be my new fave shorts this summer. I bought the black also as in the pic and am really happy with the color as they will match about anything I wear on top. They do have 2 side pockets that do not go very deep but can carry a couple of small things without the need to carry a purse if you are going someplace you would rather not such as a pool or beach area. The bottom cuffs are sewn on each side and have a couple of tacked areas to hold the fold up so they really can't be let down just in case that was a question.",Cute comfortable shorts.

positive,5.0,"I've never used this brand but I'm totally impressed. The shade is just right - although during summer when tanned I plan to switch it up a bit - and the coverage is excellent. I have a tendency to get red blotchy skin and this covers it entirely. It's gentle, non-irritating (so far) and easy to apply.

positive,5.0,"I bought a pair each of regular fit, straight leg, zipper fly Levi's, Lee, and Wrangler jeans.  The Levi's(505) were $40, the Lee's $32, and the Wrangler's $20. I washed all of them once, in cold water.  They all fit about the same.  The construction seems to be about the same too.  All had 5 belt loops and reinforced the same points.  They all were about the same weight denin.  One difference I could find was that the Levi's had two rivets on the coin pocket while the Lee's and Wranglers had one rivet there and sewed the other side of the coin pocket into the main pocket seam. Also, the Levi's print your jean size on the outside label, while the Lee's and Wranglers do not.  Both the Levi's and Lee have a double stitched external inseam on the inside of the legs and a concealed inseam on the outside of the legs.  The Wranglers reversed this with the concealed inseam on the inside and a double stitched seam on the outside.  The length of the inseam, compared to the advertised length, was pretty close, with the Lee's being the longest, and the Wranglers the shortest.

I would say the Levi's were good jeans, but were they worth the price difference?

Overall, I would say they all three pairs look like they will be fine over the longer term.  So perhaps the price difference and your preference for brands might be the deciding factor.","Levi's, Lee, and Wrangler comparison roundup"

Also, the color and subtle shades are as good as the jeans that I have that cost 6 times more. Great jeans, great fit (with a belt), and really great color.

My only minor complaint is the waste seems to have gotten slightly larger for the same size, or the pants slightly baggier only on the top so that they slide down without a belt. This has not happened before and I am the same waste size. I don't know if it is to shift more to the baggy wear the kids enjoy without a belt, or the style is not as 70's with a belt (which is good), but when I wear a belt problem solved and the fit is A+.",Great fit and color
positive,5.0,"I bought this watch for my 10yr old daughter for school because it is awesome and nobody around will have one like it plus she will have to use her brain to tell the time. It took me just a minute to set up the date and time for this watch and another binary one for my son.
People said it didn't come with instructions but mine did. You just press the B button (bottom button) and hold until it flashes then use the A button to set the hour (the hour button will be lit up) once you have the hour set press the B button again (the minutes will then light up on the buttom) use the A button to set the minutes. Do the same for the date as well after you set the time. Both the AM and PM will light up, that is how you know you are setting the date. The top #'s are the month and the bottom are the days. If you press and hold the B button after it will flash so that the time displays every 15 minutes.
If you need to see the time in between displays just press A. Its a sturdy watch the strap is not hard or awkward and it fits my 10yr olds wrist that is small but has enough holes that a grown adult could wear it. I even bought one for myself. The only thing is the ones we received have red and orange lights not blue. I bought this watch on the 7th of August and received it on the 22nd. I included some pictures.

positive,5.0,"I ordered a size x-l and they fit perfectly.  I am about 15 inches around my bicep area, 40 inches in the chest, 30 inches in the waist, and 42 inches in the butt area.  They actually fit me like a dress and I am 5'7.5.  They reached me to about mid thigh.  They are super cute, and my bf loves to see me in them.  Although, the material is a little bit thin, but I think it is perfect for Florida weather, especially during the winter when it is just a tad bit chilly.  Probably wouldn't be good for cold winters.  I love the designs, i ordered two different packs, and I'm thinking about ordering a third lol.  I actually haven't received any duplicates in color and design.  If it had the same design, it also came in a different color. I am thoroughly pleased.  I've worn and washed them in the machine about 7 times since ordering them lol and they still are holding up just fine, and haven't faded in color (but this also could be because I use clorox 2).",Kawaii

She is in law enforcement, and I wanted her to have something not only stylish but practical to carry file folders, MacBook, as well as her personal items. This bag filled all my requirements and more. It is beyond fabulous! I also purchased a matching wallet. I ALMOST did not give her these 2 Kattee items. Wanted them for myself!

positive,4.0,"These earring are very pretty and the stones are very shiny.  I definitely felt that the gold was a rose gold and not yellow as some reviewers said.  The one issue which you can tell a bit from the picture is that the stone DOES stick out quite a bit from the ear so that is a flaw in the design especially if you have long hair.

This necklace rocks!! It is so beautiful. The only thing is that it tangles super easy so I leave it hanging when I am not wearing it.

It is lightweight and very comfortable to wear. I got the silver and may go see if I can find it in gold.
It looks great with a sleeveless sundress and will be so cute with a sweater in the winter.
It is long and the pics are spot on as far as how it looks.
I looked it over really well when I first got it and did not find any spots that I had to fix or tighten. The neck did not close as tight as I wanted it to. I just added a jump ring on the collar and problem solved. I made it into a true choker. You don't need to do that- I just thought it looked better that way.
The collar is kinda neat as it has ribbon woven into the chain.
I think this is a good, solid piece that will last me several seasons. If something does happen to it, it is easy enough to add a ring here or there or close off a loop.

positive,5.0,"I have a few citizen watches and am now used to have a great watch every time I buy one of these gems.
This one is no different, great quality, keeps good time and is confortable to wear.

As a young boy i received my first citizen watch from my grandmother and got used to see them as great time machines. This opinion has never changed since they do make great watches at a affordable enough price and stand as one of the best price/quality makes in watchmaking and as i said, this black eagle skyhawk is no different. :)

Solar powered ( Ecodrive ) is a must in dive watches ( i have two citizen Ecodrive dive watches and both are outstanding ) and altough this is not a dive watch ( i don't even intend to go swimming with it ), solar powered means you don't need to change batteries. Sun is always shinning in Portugal so battery is always full :)

It's relatively simple to use, has enough features so it will keep you entertained for a long time and has plenty of time zones, should you need to travel. I withdrew most of them so that the menu doesn't show all those cities but you can go back anytime and recover them.
It's not the easiest watch to work with but also not the most complicated i have. So it's fun to have it.

The only least good points are the lack of a backlight but i already knew this before buying it ( maybe the new skyhawks with backlight could appeal more to all those who need backlight ) and also it's just a little big heavier than it should ( stainless steel ),that is, comparing with a Tissot T-touch which is all titanium and rubber strap. Both are the most confortable watches to wear, very very nice indeed.
However, it's not a heavy watch, just a bit heavier than it should?!?

Amazon US is great indeed, fast delivery, good packaging, all in all a great service. All watches ordered from them arrived in fine condition. Had bought from them before, expecting another watch from them right now :)

Thanks to our mate M_ ""Agent Of Fortune"". Loved your video review, nice music and if you take a look at his video, you'll get a close idea what to expect from this watch. :)",Exactly as I expected! Great watch! :)

positive,5.0,"I purchased this wig for an early halloween party this year. I dressed as an 80's themed guy. Wore Old Navy colorful flip flops, bright short shorts, a bright colored Jaws shirt, shutter glasses & wayfarer (switched between both), grew out a mustache, and got this wig!  The wig came in a plastic container and the wig itself was in a string net bag, which was great because it keeps it together for storage purposes. The wigs base fit great on my head, which tends to be a little larger. I usually wear L/XL hats, but it would easily fit a smaller head, since the base part is stretchy. The hair looks real and I am happy with the purchase. I receive a lot of compliments. The only downside is the tone of brown. I have closer to blonde brown facial hair. The wig is exactly what the picture shows and is a darker brown color. I highly recommend this wig to anyone looking for a costume accessory.","Great Wig, Realistic Look"

I like how vivid they are and how the design doesn't warp at the thighs from the tightness. I would buy again.",Great

positive,5.0,"This IL Caldo Mens Flat Top Hat Adjustable Army Sun Hats Baseball Cap Tripper Newsboy Cap is super adorable on my son.  I like that it is adjustable, so it fits his pre-teen sized head perfectly.  The hat seems well made and has already endured a few different wearings.

The style and coloring of this hat makes it super versatile and can be worn casually or dressed up a little more.  My son has had a great time already planning when he is going to wear this hat next.

I had the opportunity to purchase this product at discount in exchange for my honest review after use, and I am glad that I did.  This is not a product I would normally try on an impulse, but I am now a huge fan of it and will probably be purchasing again in the future.  I cant wait to try some of the different scents/formulas. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so. My aim is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own. I work very hard trying to write insightful and thoughtful reviews for each item. While it is true that many items are received at discounted rates or complimentary, my reviews are completely honest and are my personal experiences with the product. Again, it is just my opinion, your own opinion might vary. I received no monetary compensation and am not required to give a good review.",...

This particular model has just a slight bit of discrete padding at the bottom of the cup which gives you just enough lift without looking all pushed up. I did try the one without this little bit of padding and did not like the fit - it is also called Elements of Bliss, so if you want the lift, make sure you get the correct model number 1298. I also have ""side boobs"" and this bra accommodates for that. My bra for years has been an underwire Calvin Klein, 36C, but in this Elements of Bliss bra I found a 38B to be the better fit.",Pretty good bra!

He wanted to be nothing but the blue ninja for Halloween this year, and he is very observant to the extent that if we had purchased any blue ninja costume, he would have noticed there are no ropes across the chest like on his Lego figure.

I'll admit I was a bit apprehensive at first about purchasing a costume online as I assumed the photographer would have made the costume look much better in the picture than it is in real life. However, this costume proved to be an exception to the rule, and looked much better on my three-year-old than in the photo.

Pros:
-Warm enough material for Halloween night
-Multiple use (he uses it now for playing)
-Cost effective
-Aesthetics

positive,4.0,"I work in the Garden and Landscaping industry, and depending on the season can wear a pair of boots up to 60 hours a week, in all weather conditions. Comfort and durability are my top concerns when purchasing work boots.

The reasons I decided on this pair:
 1) I've worn the Timberland Titan Soft Toe in the past, and was impressed by the comfort from day one
 2) I really wanted something with a safety toe which can be difficult to find for women
 3) The soles on my previous boots always wore out first, so I was looking for something rugged

Point 1. I don't know if the Rigmaster has a different insole from the Titan or if Timberland changed things up in the year since my last purchase, but this was not nearly as cushy as my Titans. I've since changed the insole 3 times trying to get that same level of comfort I used to have, especially since I spend the vast majority of my day walking on concrete, which is murder on feet.

Point 2. The safety toe is impressive. I can move freely without having to think about safely positioning my feet all the time. It is slightly different in feel from the soft toe Titans since the boot can't ""smush"" over time as the leather gets broken in, but is by no means uncomfortable and the same sporty socks I wore previously still fit well inside the boot.

Point 3. The thicker, more rugged sole definitely takes some getting used to, since it adds both height and weight. My legs and feet were tired for the first few days from the weight, and I banged the edges into the stair's risers due to the extra height. Once I got used to them I was very impressed that the treads added extra traction on wet concrete without also getting a lot of gravel stuck in them (one of the reasons I'd liked the Titans' soles was the impossibility of always getting gravel wedged in the treads).

All in all, a very nice pair of boots. And in my job, the waterproof upper was a must and that holds true in this pair as well as the Titans. I do try to oil the leather several times a year, and don't keep them much longer than 12 to 16 months as that seems to be the life expectancy of both the arch support and the soles. My main complaint is the factory insole; my previous Titans were as comfortable as slippers from the first wear, and these have never quite matched that. I wonder if the heavy duty outer soles play in role in that as well? The lacings are also comfortable. I've never experienced any tightness or pinching at the ankle.",Durability and Comfort

positive,5.0,"I looked all over for these and finally bought them off amazon.  WalMart used to carry them but no longer does.  They are lovely material, with a cotton crotch.  They really are pretty, and the high cut legs make them feel good and not ride up.  It's hard to find size 10 underwear that looks pretty and not just like a giant old lady brief.  These are as nice as I've found.  My only complaint is about the listing.  They are very unclear on what you will get.... you can pick 'assorted' or 'wardrobe'.  What does that mean?  I bought one of each and still have no idea.  I wish they would list individual packets so you could pick some colors!  I finally went to the Hanes store at the outlet mall and bought some there.  No cheaper than amazon, but at least I could see what I was getting.  I still can't find the lovely dark jewel-tone colors WalMart used to carry.  These are all mostly cream, brown and one patterned in each package.  Oh, and one time I got an all-black 3 pack.  (I've bought these from amazon several times.)

I ordered a size bigger which fits but not perfect. In spite of that it still works and does not fall or anything. It is perfect for people who lift and workout since it is flexible and conforms to the bar. Also for those who are allergic to metals and such. I have a titanium ring which I rarely ware because it bothers me. But this one really does it job in reminding me and the people around that I am married and not looking.

Zip the collar hood off and store it in the back lumbar pocket if you think you will ever actually use it.  After a couple of months with the jacket I used the hood twice this winter, it was a good fit and helped with wind on the sledding slope.  My biggest gripe is the zippers lightweight and too fine toothed especially the main zipper.  Frankly its a lightweight jacket that cuts wind and rain well, but probably isn't up to running through brush or crawling through a lot of mud and dirt on a regular basis.

positive,4.0,"The pants were a good length and the fabric is brushed inside - good for winter wear.  The size was a bit too small to be comfortable, so I will be returning them.  My hips are on the higher side of a size 10, so it's always a gamble when I order or try on pants in the store.  I'm afraid the large would be too large. I wish I could keep them since the quality seems excellent for the price.  I especially like the pockets, the opening of which is rounded out on the front.  It appears they would not gape like many pockets do when just inserted in the seam.  I also like the fact that the elastic waistband is tapered for a better fit.","Great Pants, But a Little Too Small"

I ordered an 8.5, which all of my other boots are, but even with thick socks they were big in the ankles and a bit wide, except in the toes, where the boot tapers a little.

positive,5.0,This is the only boot my 8 yr old will wear. More expensive than some of the others but worth the money. My sons first pair of John Deere boots has lasted through 3 boys. They are still in good shape but the sole of the heel has worn down til you can barely see any black. Pull on boots are so much more convenient than laces...they put them on themselves.

positive,4.0,"These are really beautiful. They are much softer than most lace type of underwear that I have ever worn before. They have a nice stretch but are thin enough that you hardly notice you are wearing them. I am 5'5'' 125lbs and a size 2 dress and I got the size small and they are perfect. I love that you can get a variety of colors, and this style is my personal favorite for underwear. I am always looking for different brands since they all make them slightly different. These are very comfortable. The only thing that keeps this from being a 5 star is that I have noticed upon wearing a few pairs that there are a few strings that are lose, not quite frayed but I guess I need to just clip it off. You can see it in the picture. It is not a deal breaker, because I think these are great, but I think it is something that the company can work on to make these even better and more durable.

positive,4.0,"This is a nice, attractive ring with sparkling Zirconia. The ring itself is 2 mm wide and has 26 clear and soft pink stones each stone being also 2 mm along the ring. The rhodium has a silvery luster and the coating is smooth. The reason for not giving it 5 stars is that the inside is not a smooth surface but rather the outsides as walls with a gap in between. As the holes below the stones in the gap are of uneven size, it looks a little cheap when look at it from the inside. But overall it has a nice unobtrusive style to it which allows to focus on the nice stones.

After reading the earlier reviews I ordered this crop top bra in the large size with hopes that it would neither be too loose in some areas nor too tight in others; it did not disappoint - the fit is perfect!

Adding my two cents to some earlier comments and questions: I would not wear this bra outside of my home because I like more coverage and support when out and about; it also can't disguise the body's reaction to any temperature changes. While perfect for doing yoga or Pilates it doesn't give enough support for doing vigorous exercise (think Zumba, running, etc.) or sports.  It is all one piece with no fasteners and very stretchy so I find the easiest way to put it on is to step into in and pull it up over my hips and waist.",So comfortable!

positive,4.0,I bought this as a gift for my wife and she really likes it.  Nice watch face and comfy leather band.  My wife's wrist is thin and she has to use the innermost hole to secure the watch on her.  Watch probably fits better with slight bigger to medium wrists.  I was searching for a watch that wasn't too showy or glittery and this watch worked out well.  Overall pleased with the purchase and value so far.,Pretty Watch.  Fits medium wrists better.

These are the most comfortable shoes ever! The soles are tall and I like that because I have flat feet and I found that the taller the sole the less my feet hurt when I'm on them for too long.

positive,4.0,"The sizing in these shoes is the biggest issue (no pun intended). Without exception, my closet is full of size 10 shoes and boots. I ordered these in a 10 and they were too big...much too big. Because they don't come in half sizes (so strange), I ordered a size 9. These do fit but there is no allowance in the length... a 9.5 would be just right if it existed. So, they are a full size too large. I love the grey color and the shiny studs really sparkle. They will, however, start to fall off. It's not really noticeable because the shoes are so sparkly and the studs so tiny. The other issue that I have with these shoes is that the brand tag is stitched onto the insole and while you wouldn't think it'd matter, it really is annoying. I use Tacco inserts in my shoes so that takes care of that problem. The shoes look really cute with everything.... cropped jeans, skinny jeans, skirts, etc., and I get a compliment every time I wear them. I liked them so much, I got them in both gray and black. I wouldn't invest a lot of $$$ because the studs will fall off but if you can get them on the cheap, do it!",There are some issues but still a cute shoe!

positive,5.0,"Super cute dress.  Long enough to wear to work.  Fabric is a pretty typical printed cotton, a little stiff (think: fabric straight from the bolt in a craft store), but the pattern is vibrant.  A weird thing:  It comes with a separate belt-piece, which is basically a band of the same fabric with a two-button closure.  You can wear it with or without (I wear it with, because I think it defines the waist a bit more, but it looks fine without).  Cute dress; follow the size chart.","Cute dress, great fit"
positive,5.0,"This conditioner softened my hair and gave it a lot of shine.  It is thick and that helps it stay in your hair and condition.  The directions suggest leaving it in your hair for a few minutes to allow it to work.  It comes in a very pretty container as do all Obliphica products.  It may cost more than other conditioners, but I think it is a case of ""you get what you pay for"".",Amazing Conditioner
positive,4.0,"I tried using the Bliss Crown Jewels collection that contained 4 skin products.

Some of the features are as follows:
1) These products contain vitamin C, E and green tea. The presence of these vitamins cleans and revitalizes the skin making it
  feel soft and shining radiantly as ever.
2) It imitates the skin treatment that one gets after visiting a spa.
3) It is a good gifting option for the holidays.

Benefits:
1) The lemon scented sage body butter moisturizes dry skin and smooth-ens it well.  It is non- greasy with mild a citrus
  fragrance.
2) The face wash acts as a cleanser as well as exfoliator to clean the skin of dirt and make-up.
3) The triple oxygen mask brings a glow to the face and wipes off the tired look. It has a mild scent.
4) The bliss love handler is a cream that one applies to the waist everyday. The  product claims to reduce the body fat along
  with exercise and a balanced diet over a period of time. I have to try the results as yet. Will update my review later.",Makes the skin soft and radiant ..

positive,4.0,"UPDATE: 1-19-13 After three short months, the seam between the sole and the boot started separating, creating a big hole. I called Timberland and was given instructions about how to send them in for warranty review. Happy to report they shipped me a brand new pair, which arrived just a little over two weeks after I'd sent in my damaged pair. Disappointed I this happened, and hope there's not a repeat, but very happy that the company stood behind the product!

I need waterproof boots for walking my dogs, and these fit the bill perfectly, with the added bonus of looking cute! These boots do a much better job of cradling my foot for a comfortable walk, unlike knee-high rain boots which I always feel like my feet are sloshing about in, making walking up or down hill difficult. The only down-side of short boots is that water and debris that gets kicked up does sometimes land in my boot, but for me, the comfort factor makes up for that. Plus, my feet don't sweat in these--I even wear them in 80 degree weather if it's wet without any overheating discomfort!",awesome waterproof boots

positive,5.0,"This is my 2nd on-line order of Clarks and the first success.  The first order and replacement for a pair of pumps were both too big that I did not think I'd give Clark's a try again.  I wasn't particularly looking for a pair of boots (in May) but when this popped up on ad panel of my screen, it piqued my interest because it has the basic/classic design I've been searching for: no frills and a bit of heel.  And it was discounted! The design is as expected (classic) and just the right walking heel.  The material and craftsmanship is of good quality.  The right boot fits like a glove (foot and legs) and left boot requires a bit of pull to zip up.  My calves: right=14 1/8""; left=14 2/8"".  There is enough elasticity in the boot material for that 1/8"" difference that I believe it will all work out.  It's soft to walk on around the house and I am hoping it feels the same during longer walks on city street.  It's a keeper.",Fits (almost) like a glove!

Considering how many cards most of us carry these days, it's amazing how few products there are of this type and, as far as I can tell, nothing ""high end."" I carry only 2-3 actual credit cards, but everything from my library card to my AAA card to the discount card for the pet food store is plastic.

positive,5.0,"If you're a bike commuter looking for a shoe you can ride in and wear around a casual office, this is a great shoe.  I've got a 30 mile round trip commute in the Boston area and I've been very impressed with this shoe.  I've used it for about 360 miles of winter riding so far and they are very solid.  As a pedal platform, they are fairly stiff.

I've used them comfortably down to 13F coupled with thick socks, chemical warmers, and Planet Bike toe covers.  The shoes are well-ventilated via mesh uppers, so they are not water proof or water resistant.  Without the covers I don't think they would very comfortable much below 50F.  I bought size 45 so I would have room in the shoe for the thicker socks and warmers.  I normally wear size 43.

My coworkers, used to my more standard bike shoes (Diadora MTB shoes) were surprised that these were bike shoes.  Several asked if I had retrofitted regular shoes.  They are comfortable enough to walk around in and the cleats (yes, you have buy them separately) are recessed enough that you don't sound like you're wearing tap shoes.

I'm very happy with the SH-MT33L shoes.  I would buy them again and recommend them to a friend without hesitation.","Good looking bike shoe, suitable for commuting"

positive,4.0,"Classic, timeless boots are a lot harder to come by than I originally expected. I browsed for months, but never could find
exactly what I was looking for. I like the old-school look - something you might've seen James Dean, the young Marlon Brando,
or Steven Mcqueen wear. I wanted a pair the lightweight, non-bulky, vintage (for lack of a better word) looking boots to wear
casually, and while I'm riding my cafe racer. I finally came across Caterpillar's Orson boots, and they completely fit the bill.

Caterpillar's Orson boots look great, and are relatively comfortable, but there are a few complaints I have that keep them from
being the perfect pair of boots: They are ONE WHOLE SIZE larger - so order ONE WHOLE SIZE SMALLER. It's that easy. The color is
not a traditional color leather, as they are pictured on Amazon. They are a blend of dark brown, olive green, and a hint of grey.
This bothered me initially, but I've grown used to the color. It definitely doesn't take away from the overall old-school vibe of
the boot.

I've only worn them for a week now, but I can say if you are looking for an affordable pair of classic, casual boots made by a
reputable company, I would definitely recommend these.","Very Cool Pair of Classic, Casual Boots"

positive,5.0,"Probably my most cherished piece of trail/outdoor gear are my La Sportiva hiking boots.  We've seen a lot together.  We've spent a lot of time together.  So it was with no small amount of concern that I noticed the Vibram sole coming detached in several places.

I took the boots to a local cobbler.  Well, cobbler in name only, as he declared in no uncertain terms that these boots were ""impossible"" to fix.  Impossible?  Hardly!  The sole itself still had lots of life left in it.  It didn't even have any holes, and the treadwear was nowhere near where a replacement sole would be the best course.  Impossible.  Bah.  I spent hours getting these boots broken in just right.  No way in hell am I going to buy all new boots for this, not when all that was needed was to re-cement the sole to the shoe.

I was all set to buy some Shoe Goo when, in my internet reading, I came across an article in Backpacker magazine where my exact issue was described.  The equipment editor's prescription?  Freesole.  So I bought some.  And $7 worth of freesole saved my boots.

To be sure, it's important to follow the directions but with a little more care to give yourself the best conditions for a permanent fix.  In this case, I let it cure for 48 hours, not overnight.  I did NOT skimp on the cement, used a plastic knife to spread it smoothly, and used extra Freesole on the seam to make sure it would hold.  Lastly, I weighted the boots rather heavily to make sure there was a good seal, and I used paracord to add pressure to the sole and boot where a weight wouldn't fit.

And yes, I'm serious about the 48 hours.  Be patient.  DO NOT fiddle with it while it's curing.  Just put it aside and forget about it for two days.  When you revisit it, you'll find a very durable and waterproof seal, even better than the factory cement.

This is very good stuff.  It's by no means a fast fix (meaning don't count on this to save your bacon on the trail for ad hoc repairs), but it's a long lasting one.  I'm very happy with this.",Very good.  Very VERY good.

positive,5.0,"I bought Carhartt work dungarees since I wanted durable pants I could use for snow blowing, cutting the grass, and doing other work around the house.  I also am a teacher, so I need pants that will look good for me in school.  These pants sure are just right for outdoor work and school.  What I like is the back pockets are nice and large.  My over-sized wallet fits perfectly.  The front pockets are big enough and sturdy enough to hold everything you want to put inside. The other benefit is that since they are work dungarees, the pockets are designed to carry all sorts of items in them without getting holes in them.

I am a physically larger person and these pants actually make me look good.  They fit really well.  The best part is that when you bend, stretch, or pick up something you aren't going to have a blow out on the side of the pants or in the crotch area.  I just wish I had purchased these about ten  years ago. There are also added side pockets for tools or whatever you want.  The material is great and also the pants fit a bit loose, which I like. The material doesn't chafe you, but you can tell it can stand up to wear and tear.  If you are a hard-on-clothing sort of person, then buy these pants.

I ended up buying 5 pairs of these in all different colors, and may be back for more.

They're thin, but not too bad. I would say, however, that sometimes my foot slides in my shoe when I'm walking.

My feet are just above a 9.5, so I have to wear a 10 to keep it safe. These socks tend to make my feet slide around a bit in my shoe, so I would be aware of this when getting these. It's no fault of the sock; they feel great and slide on and off with ease while still sticking to the shape of my leg.","Comfortable socks, but be aware of wearing them with shoes a bit larger than your feet."

positive,4.0,"Introduced in the 1960s, braided Perlon straps are a great slip-on watch strap for tropic climes and temperatures. They wash easily, regain their shape with a little massaging, and can complement any watch in various colors. They're a great addition for dive watches in summer, and adapt to water sports very well due to their quick drying qualities.

This Wrist and Style braided strap is good, not as fine a weave as Eulit Kristall Perlon braided straps, possibly like their Panama braid (I don't have one to compare). The buckle is a solid, heavy work of art, but not curved so the strap forms a little bump under the shirt cuff; it's not a problem under a dress shirt. The heat finishing on each end is a bit crude (I had to re-trim the buckle end on mine with a small butane heat gun), but does not easily fray. The fabric keeper is a very snug fit on the single thickness of the strap, and makes it hard to get the point through it on my wrist. I hope this will be remedied with repeated use. WAS could stand to assemble the keepers around two thicknesses of strap as they are meant to be used. (I slide the keeper under the short, buckle end so that I don't have the keeper against my skin. Otherwise the keeper would have to accommodate 3 layers of strap.)

This style of buckle allows adjustment of the strap length from buckle to point, even though the braid allows infinite fastening points. To reduce wear and tear on the same place you put the tongue, you can adjust the strap a little from week to week. I also gently wash these straps in tepid water, rinse and towel dry after wearing, to prolong the lifetime. WAS' strap shows little signs of wear after a few weeks of use and care, and holds up to to even a larger 42mm dive watch.

N.B. Amazon's fulfillment mislabeled a 22mm black strap as 20mm dark grey, so I received the wrong strap. WAS promptly sent me a replacement at no charge. Thanks, guys!","Good value for money strap; very good, solid buckle; wears nicely"

positive,4.0,"Like many American women I had no idea what my REAL bra size was until I was fitted. I walked around for years wearing poorly fitting, unflattering bras with a high band with and lower cup size (based on that obscure formula where you add 5 inches to the number and then subtract to determine bra size).  I thought I was doomed to wear Victoria Secret (VS)  if I wanted anything remotely sexy.  Don't get me wrong since there is nothing wrong per se with VS. Still, I thank my lucky stars I have not been in one since high school.

What with working out and aging and...enhancements my body has changed radically off and on over the past 15 years. Luckily I have managed to get fitted by a Pro several times which enables me to shop on line for Freya, Fantasie and Panache to name a few high quality makers of DD+ lingerie. Which means I am able shop on line and not end up with bras that fit poorly that are a hassle to return if I should happen to regret the purchase.

Other than a strapless longline I needed for a wedding once I do not really need a longline for the purpose a garment like that is intended. I just knew I wanted at least one Freya longline since I loved how sexy it looked on the model. Unfortunately after trying on the Freya longline in various patterns such as the Piper, Patsy and lastly the Flourish it became sadly apparent I was not going to end up with one. I was uneasy with the amount of forward projection this bra created. I did not like the silhouette or overall shape it created with clothing. It looked great without clothes but with clothes it kind of reminded me of the ""bombshell"" look of the 50's. Ew. Just Ew. Still, I feel as a low-cut, slightly padded, semi longline the bra is what it purports  to be and fit the way it was supposed to. It just wasn't me. (At. All.)

** On the brighter side I love the pattern so I ended up buying the Flourish Underwire Plunge Balcony Bra 1541 in Black. :)

**I agree wholeheartedly with the reviewer who reminds us that when you size down in the band you must remember to go up in the cup  Size can also vary by brand/manufacturer
Here's this from elsewhere
Go down a sister size: Reduce your band size by two, but take your cup size up one interval.
For instance, you might go from a 36 D to a 34 DD
Go up a sister size: Increase your band size by two, but go down one cup size. For instance, you might go from a 36 F to a 38 E (DDD)",MUST try this one on before you buy it
positive,4.0,"I bought these for winter at our wind site. It kept my feet warm in -20F as long as I kept moving. I also took them hunting this winter, and they are comfortable to hike around in as well. For a smaller person, they're not as lightweight as everyone seems to profess. When you're climbing 300+ ft every day, every little ounce feels like a pound.

My only gripe would be that the rubber on the toe has started peeling a little bit, but only the outside edge by the stitching. The black leather (?) has also started cracking around the toe area where it bends. I suppose if I oiled them occasionally it might prevent that, but it's not a huge issue. I just walked through 4"" deep mud/water puddles without having any water intrusion - feet are perfectly dry and warm.

They're a great boot, very roomy, and comfortable. Didn't really have any break-in period that I can remember. I've been wearing them for the last 6 months and they're holding up just fine.",and they are comfortable to hike around in as well
positive,4.0,"I bought this as a impulse but for My boyfriend on Christmas. He already has two coats, a leather jacket for cold days and a pea coat for really cold days. However, we live in Colorado, and a day that starts off chill can turn to a scorcher and a day that starts off pleasant can become less so with just the right amount of wind. So he needed an in-between jacket; one for the transitional seasons of spring where he could have a light weight jacket that keeps the chill off. This jacket works very nicely. It is sturdy, and could be used as a camping jacket while still being streamlined enough to look stylish in the city.

He's a picky guy when it comes to styling, but he liked the subdued color as well as the raised seams that gave it a bit of punch. The sizing is good. I decided to spring and get him an xl so that if it was a brisk day he could wear a sweater under it and not feel too squished. The xl has plenty of room to bundle up in, so if your guy fills out a large tee-shirt you might consider bumping him up a size for comfort.

One critique is that it is a bit heavier that I anticipated, but not so much so that it will stop it from being a spring/fall jacket. Material will keep the wind off and it is water resistant, so I'm sure he'll be snug when he walks to his train in the morning.

Hope this helps, it was a good buy on sale, but worth the non-sale price.",Pleases picky boyfriends

positive,4.0,These are very cute sandals.  Even prettier in person.  I couldn't wait to get them in the mail.  I love the color and the bling  on it and they seem very versatile and summery.  I love wearing sandals but have a hard time finding sandals that are comfortable.  These are comfortable but definitely no arch support.  They seem pretty sturdy and the buckle stays on well.  The do fit my feet a bit narrow.  My feet are a bit wide and these were snug at first.  It feels that maybe they are adjusting to my feet however my pinkie toe is confused as to where it needs to go. It wants to pop out from under the strap although that's not comfortable but my toe isn't long enough to be held in so I have to figure that one out.  The bottom is textured and rubberized to prevent slipping.  Definitely pretty sandals for the price.  I did get these for a discount for my honest and unbiased review.,"Very cute sandals.

positive,4.0,"I purchased the Louises in the Burgundy color directly from the Doc Martens website. The Louises are normally quite expensive but I snagged them during a 70% off sale. I must say that I had a pleasant transaction and the boots arrived quickly without problems or defects. There is an inner zipper which makes them easy to take on and off. The heel looks imposing but isn't; they are easy to walk in. I wear a solid US Size 9 and the UK 7 fit perfectly. It was not too narrow for me, nor was it too wide. The design of the Louise is marvelous and chic. I love the heel, especially with the Burgundy color. I receive compliments each time I wear them. They are easy to clean and do not need to be polished since the outside of the boot is coated with a smooth varnish.

The only issue I have with the Louise boot is that they are not as comfortable as my other high-heeled Docs. I find that the longer I walk in them, the more the ball of my foot begins to become tender. I don't think they have as much cushioning as my other Docs do, but that can be rendered easily enough by purchasing a cushion. Other than that, there are no rubs elsewhere and they are stunning to wear out. Both men and women love them. I included two pictures that I uploaded to the image section.",Haute uniqueness!

positive,5.0,"I just love this little dress! It is great for summer and late spring. I would advise that you pay attention to the sizing chart - I am normally a small. I am about 5 foot tall and weight 120-125 lbs. I purchased a small after some careful consideration. It fits fairly well right now, but if I gain weight it will end up looking too tight. This looks really cute on! I would recommend pairing it with flats, sandals, wedges, as well as a belt. A long or short necklace would be adorable if you paired it with this dress. Additionally, I thought this dress was really comfortable and I could wear it all day.

This little dress is affordable enough that you could purchase it in different colors, too. You could wear this to multiple occasions and either dress it up or down, depending on where you were going. Being that it is so versatile, that really increases the value ten fold! Love this and I am very happy with my purchase overall!

positive,4.0,"Shipping was fast, I was impressed with it. Took 3 days total from ordering. The color is right and it was a great price. I just needed a lightweight robe I could toss on quickly.
There's 2 reasons for the rating, one: yes, I get that it's cheap and not real silk or anything like that, but it feels rough and almost like it's been starched, I'll see if washing it a few times with some fabric softener helps. It's definitely not silky on your skin. The second reason is that it's long, hits the model at just above her knee. That was the length I was hoping for. Falls to about an inch under my knees. Granted, I'm short (5ft even), but the waistline is right where it should be. I expected the length to be there as well.",Satin Robe

positive,4.0,"When you want to install a video security system but don't want to deal with wires, this is the perfect solution. I've been able to place my cameras all over the house without any issues. Suddenly changing my mind on what room I would like the camera in is not a problem thanks to the wireless system.

The battery life has been great. I kept the recordings at the lowest settings with 20 second clips whenever t detects motion. The quality of the video is still great, and it has been 5 weeks now since I've installed the system and the battery indicator still says full on all the cameras. Whether the battery indicator is accurate is another thing.

So far I love the system. It has provided me with the security I wanted for my home without the hassle of the install. I'll update this review later down the line once it has seen more rain and weather changes.","Easy install, works great, awesome battery life"

They unfortunately were not on the same level as the Dickie's I picked up, but I'm not displeased with my purchase of Gold Toe at this point in time.

I also ended up buying it in purple, black, burgundy, grey, and taupe. The light rose color is slightly more mauve then pictured on the computer, but it is still a very pretty color. I let my roommate wear it one day, and the next week she had ordered 2 for herself.

positive,4.0,"Got these today.  After reading some reviews, I was not ready for what I pulled out from the package.  I have been trying to get true wet look black leggings for a while and all I could find were the heat treated variety, and these have been of low quality with bad seams.  I was hoping these were different.  When I pulled these out of their package I was greeted by leggings of a slick matt black appearance that was NOT heat treated lycra like the others.  These looked like the real deal.  As stated in one review these fit better without underwear, so after really look them over, I took everything off and began the process of getting these on.  Sat down, and was pleasantly surprised to find the leg cuff fairly easily went over my foot with just a bit of tugging.  But as I pulled the leg up I knew this would not be easy.  It took A LOT of work to put these on without tugging too hard.  You have to drag you fingers up the material to get it where it needs to go.  Once on though....WOW!!!  Skin tight, except at the knees it seems, but that is not too awful.  They feel awesome to wear if a bit restricting in movement.  The waistband goes just over your naval. They do feel great minus underwear, and yes if you did have those on you would see their seams.  These will be hot thermally to wear though, as they are coated lycra...also the material may not hold up...only time will tell.  I will likely be getting another pair of these, maybe in large (I am 6ft, 32 waist, 155 pounds, and med fit really well, and large might be easier)",True and affordable wet look leggings.

positive,4.0,"Love the skirt. However, there is nothing ""eyelet"" about the fabric. It is plain cotton voile fabric with no eyelets. Also it does not come in 16 colors, so maybe that is just to entice you to look though all their products to make sure.

The edges at each tier and the bottom are not finished and get frayed with washing, but I like that style, exactly the look I wanted. The only thing that would be better about the skirt itself, is if the lining inside was a little longer. The material is the weight expected (lightweight) but still, the skirt is see-through. past the short liner. I am 5'4"" and I am fine with the length. The waistband is very stretchy and could fit anyone from small to large.","Love the skirt, but description misleading"

Got the Helium because it complies with most carriers size restrictions when not using the expansion capabilities.  This carry on is light, has great wheels and the handle is easy to use as well.  A couple things that keep it from being 5-star:
The pull handle feels cheap.  It moves and wiggles a lot.  Hoping it lasts.
In order to maximize interior space they haven't hidden the framework.  So you have to pack a bit differently to create that flat bottom to reduce wrinkles.  This isn't that big of deal though.

Speaking of price, not bad for everything being included! My only gripe is that, the sleeves are super long. I'm 6 foot and it surpasses my arm length by a long shot, you will need pins to prop the sleeves up for an appropriate length for yourself. To compliment this costume, I strongly ADVISE you a pair of white gloves to go with this.  It will complete the costume, any white gloves will do, but I bought some tuxedo gloves:

positive,5.0,"I'm a minimalist runner and triathlete. I've been very selective regarding the footwear my son wears. As he his feet grow, the selection of minimalist shoes grows thinner and thinner. Unlike many brands of shoes out there the Merrell flux glove is true to the minimalist name. The sole appears to be zero drop (not a raised heel) and is very flexible (you can easily fold it in either direction. Also importantly the sole is equally flexible along the length of the shoe so it doesn't have a tendency to kink and pinch his feet. Teh rest of the shoe is very light and flexible as well. Another great feature are the material of the laces, which are in between being able to get knots untied easily and not randomly coming undone all the time. Though I recommend having your kids double knot. I feel this shoe will be a staple for my son in the coming years.",So far the best shoe for my son

positive,4.0,"Most of my complaints center around the fact that these sunglasses are not like my old favorite pair I lost last year.  On the plus side, they're quite comfortable once you get them located in the sweet spot on your nose.  I wore these six hours straight on a road trip, and actually forgot they were on.  The frames are sturdy, with quality hinges.  The appearance is cool, if you like that sort of thing.  I mostly got them for something different.

There is some vision distortion, again depending on how high or low they sit on the nose.  They do not fold flat enough to fit in a pocket, so I attached a neck cord (not included).  The complaint about fitting ""somewhat small"" is not so much the size of the frame, but the size of the lenses and nose pads.

The included case is semi-hard, but adequate quality and fit.  All the advertised accessories were included, again of adequate quality.  25 beans is a pretty good price for glasses of this quality, but I would not call it a steal.  These are not my favorite sunglasses, but I like them well enough to buy a second pair, with the retro blue lenses.  Like those even better.",Not bad for the price.

positive,5.0,"This arrived yesterday.  It arrived very quickly and was well packaged.  It came in a cute, little, red gift box with a cleaning cloth, it was then packaged inside of a mail bag.  The anklet is very pretty and dainty looking.  It is very shiny and attractive.  Although it looks very dainty it is well made and not to delicate that it will break from wearing.  I wore it to work today and received many compliments on it.  I am very pleased with this purchase.

7/5/2016 review update:
I really loved this anklet but after wearing it daily since I got it I need to update my review.  Everything I stated above still stands however the clasp on the anklet comes undone, often.  Several time it has come off, luckily I was always at home and was able to find it and put it back on.  Unfortunately it happened again today while I was out shopping, I felt it fall off my ankle as I was walking out to my car, I stopped immediately to look for it, my son was with me and looking as well but we could not find it.  So because of a faulty clasp I no longer have my favorite anklet.  I am not sure if I just got a bad clasp or if this is a problem that others have experienced as well.  Very disappointed.",Very dainty.

positive,5.0,"You know how they say you don't recognize a bad relationship until you get into a good one?  That was my relationship with my previous underwire sports bra.  It hurt, the wire came loose and poked, but I assumed those were the things you put up with to have an underwire sports bra.  Then I put on one of these! (Sound of heavenly choir).  Now, I haven't put it through an intense aerobics class yet, but I've worn them to work for weeks and have run short distances, jumped, crawled, and twisted in it, and it has performed well and I have not been embarassed.  I wear a sports bra to work because I sometimes have to unexpectedly engage in such physicality, and these are a great improvement over my previous bras.  I wear a 42D, and keeping me looking dignified is no small task.  The ability to convert it to racerback is a bonus (a little hook can hold the two straps together in the back), though I usually wear it in the traditional way.  One fitting tip: when I wore the band too tight, my breasts got distorted into an almond or teardrop shape--as soon as I got the band right, they looked like breasts again.",Terrific!

positive,5.0,"Great Girls Hiking Shoe! Our 7 year old was always blowing out the soles or toes of her shoes from playing so hard. We needed to find a pair of shoes that would be comfortable enough for all day wear, but also be extra durable. These shoes are just that. She can wear them for walking, running, playing, going to school, fishing, playing sports, and of course hiking. The color is a nice deep purple, but not too bright. The outer material is a mixture of suede and leather. The material seems to hold up well and doesn't scuff easily.

positive,4.0,"So, this shirt is super soft. Everyone compliments me on it, and my kids just nuzzle their faces on me for the fuzz. I have no idea what it's made of. It has no laundering instructions. I washed it on delicate with cold water and laid it flat to dry. Now for the sizing.. this thing has a supreme amount of stretch. When I put this on the sleeves came about 2 inches above my wrist, which is way to short for my taste. But if I pull on them they go past my fingertips. Same with the torso, it comes past the top of my low rise jeans, but I could probably stretch this sucker down to a tunic dress. Sadly, until I figure out how to stretch the sleeves permanently I will have to keep pushing them up to 3/4 sleeves to make them look right. Hence the 1 star deduction. If I can get the sleeves to stretch down though, this will be a truly lovely sweater.","I really like this shirt, mostly..."

positive,4.0,"I ordered a medium, I am 5'6 , 135 lbs, and a size 34 B. This dress is so cute, the length is good for my height, it hits above the knee. The color of this dress, online, just by looking at it looks to be a dark orange, rust kind of color, even though it states cantaloupe. I was expecting it to be a darker orange rust color, but to my surprise it was like a peach, or very light pink orange. It is so pretty though, even the back with the doily lace.

positive,5.0,"I'm 5'2"" and am a die-hard Levi's fan.  It's about all I wear. Their skinny jeans and leggings, even in short (if you can find them), are always too long.  I wanted a form-fitting jean that I could wear with heels for a sleek, lean leg.  I'm 5'2"" and about 106 - I order size 5.  These hit just above the ankle and are perfect with heels.  I'm going to be careful about laundering them because I don't want shrinkage and for them to go too far above the ankle.  The only thing I didn't really like about them is that instead of there being a hem they're rolled a couple of times, very small, and sewn.  I suppose I could have this taken out and have a simple seam sown at the bottom (which I might still do).  I ordered these in white and liked them so much a I ordered another pair in regular blue denim.  I think they'll work really well with little ballet flats and Havaianas, too.",Perfect for petites!

Even though a wide size was not offered, the shoe was perfect - as recommended in prior reviews, I ordered my regular size.  It is quite wide, and smooth inside, without extra seams in the front section, which should lead to less irritating rubbing.  These are very comfortable; they are even better than I had expected.  The shoes are extremely light, and will be perfect to pack and take along on trips.  I have not had a chance to test them out in the water yet. There are no holes in the sole for drainage, so that is a concern.  Laces are extremely long.  The sunny lime color is fun.",the shoe was perfect. It is quite wide

positive,5.0,"Well made, lots of spandex for snug fit.  Good bra for gals with bigger bosoms, though not so sure on the ""minimizing"" factor.  But it's pretty and fun.  If you are in this larger size category consider this model of Lilyette.  I've had quite a few now and they hold up well, especially if you wash them by hand.  7-24-16: another review.  These are great bras, well designed, top rate fabric.  Just ordered 2 more.  I  think I've had about 7-8 of them.  Thing is, if you take care of them, and wash by hand, they last.  But, you have to have a few so you can trade them out, ( this is key!)  and give the others a rest.  The stats:  the underwire doesn't come up so far that it hits you in the chin, rather, it remains low, right between your boobs, and, the bra fits and sticks right on your bod, not poking or even trying to poke out, either under the arm or out front.  And you know what I mean girlfriends.....Also, the cup is flexible, yet solid in holding your boobs in place.  There is a little giggle, but not much.  And, it's comfortable.  Being 40DD I have to wear a bra, hate it, but that's that, but, this bra is almost like not having one on, at least for me, all bodies being so different.  One more thing, they have them in some pretty pattern designs which is delightful and sexy, not all that plain white stuff.  Btw, i no longer go to the store to getem, once you know your size and it fits, just order online.  Forget the terror of the dressing room and all that bad lighting!  Big Bosomed Women and Men Unite!",Lilyette to the rescue!

The top attached to the baseplate by inserting the thin metal vertical bar into a hole in the baseplate, and then tightening a small screw.

positive,5.0,"Totally exceeded my expectations!!! Back story: I'm not one of those super confident, super sexual beings. I don't LOVE my body (size 18 about 265) but I don't HATE it either. However, wearing this I kinda became one of those super confident, sexual beings!! Opening the package it comes extremely compacted and was jarring to say the least but the fabric is very, VERY stretchy, soft and comfortable. It sort of reminded me of thick, nice pantyhose type of material. Let's not forget what it's for it lingerie and I paid a whopping (not) $12.99. For this price, smooth texture of the material and the way it perfectly fit over fleshy, jiggly, far from perfect body and made me feel and LOOK super smoking hot AF I'm getting one in EVERY color! Styling notes: It had enough material to adjust it on my body. I chose to pull it down a little more to cover love handles and that too meaty, fat part where my thighs and butt meet. Also, because I am neurotic and insecure about my boobs sagging I wore a black sports type bra under neath it (FYI BF didn't notice until he tried to take it off and saw it wasn't attached, like he cared). I also bought 2 pairs of thigh high stockings from Amazon that surprisingly fit over my enormously gigantic thunder thighs. For underwear I decided to go commando. I told you I was feeling myself ;) by the time I got it on feeling sex enough no to wear any.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/IYISS-Women-s-Seamless-Hollow-Out-Fishnet-Chemise-Standard-N-Plus-Plus-Fits-XL-3XL-Black/dp/B01FB15POS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">IYISS Women's Seamless Hollow Out Fishnet Chemise Standard N Plus (Plus Fits XL-3XL, Black)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Plus-Size-Hosiery-Black-Fishnet-Lace-Top-Stay-Up-Silicone-Thigh-High-Stockings-5x-6x-26-28/dp/B00M9NJ7HI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Plus Size Hosiery Black Fishnet Lace Top Stay Up Silicone Thigh High Stockings 5x/6x 26/28</a>",Turns You Into A Smokin Hott Bih!!

It is constructed very well and seems to be of excellent quality--as expected.  I had hoped to use it as an everyday purse, but will likely use it as a carry-on on an upcoming trip and as a work bag.  Still looking for the perfect super casual purse, but this bag is fantastic.

However, while searching the internet for some Star Wars shoes I came across the different versions that Crocs had available. They caught my eye so I decided to order a pair just for kicks. Best decision I have made because I now see why people love these shoes. They are incredibly comfortable and I forget that I am wearing them most of the time. I liked them so much I asked for another pair for Christmas. I was hoping to get the Chewbacca furry crocs but I guess I put down too many options and wound up with the Dark Vader crocs. Which I also love. I may break down and just buy the Chewbacca crocs before it gets too warm to enjoy them. I usually wear between a size 7-8 in mens shoes so I went which the size 8.

I do overall like it and will be buying a few more in a few other colors. Oh and someone mentioned the arm holes being to big or something like that, but i didn't  have that problem.",I like it.

It's comfortable and it looks nice, and since I only spent about $9 for the hoodie, I didn't bother returning it. When I first got it, it had an unusual smell but it goes away after you wash it.
The material is also a bit stretchy so I recommend just getting your regular size. If you want a bigger, baggier hoodie, get a size or two larger.",Nice crop-top hoodie.

The only thing I don't love about these shoes is that it is a darker leopard print. Most leopard print has a lighter tan background, but this one has a dark brown background. I think these are little dark to wear with black pants. This probably doesn't bother most people, but I wear a lot of leopard so I see a difference.",Like Pillows for your Feet

A friend of mine had a pair of the original frogskins, and I tried them on and found they fit my face much better than the lx did. That is how I came to purchase these original frogskin glasses. I couldn't be happier with my decision, as they fit my face quite well and allow me to look around without sliding off my nose and hitting the ground.

However, as a short person, the length of this dress is too long.  It'd be nice if it came in a petite length.  The other issue that I have with it is that it takes a long time to dry on low heat.  After 40 minutes on low heat, it's still damp.  On the other hand, it has less rayon content than do other maxis on the market and it's nice that it can be thrown in the dryer.

Pros-
-Price. This bag is very low in price for such a big bag.
-It's cute and girly.
-Spacious. It has a lot of room in it. My kids are two year old, and come with a lot of stuff. Aside from the normal stuff that goes into a diaper bag and food, I was able to fit everything we needed in here.

Cons-
-The shoulder strap is not comfortable when you have this bag full.
-The zipper gets stuck easily.
-The bag is cheaply made. It didn't tear or break while on our trip, but I could see it tearing pretty easily.

The top is good for larger-busted gals like myself (the ruching in the front gives a bit of a 'bombshell' look) and it definitely keeps everything in place for yoga -- and keeping me honest with my posture in yoga, I just wouldn't wear this out and about if I want to look my best.",Great for yoga but runs a little snug.

In fact they are the only shoes I bring along for trade shows where I'm on my feet most of the day.  They have great arch support and although they look and feel kind of heavy my feet love the support and feel great all day.  I got the cordovan color because I like the looks of it and because black seems so boring (I have so many pairs of black shoes, most of which I seldom wear because they aren't as comfy as these).  I find they go well with black, brown, and navy which are the main colors of slacks that I wear. They also look great with jeans.

I normally take a size 8 medium in shoes but the size of these shoes that feel the most comfortable is a EU size 39 which would translate to a 8.5 to 9.  These shoes should fit a little loosely in order to be comfortable, and since I wear them mostly in the winter or cool weather I like to have room for socks.  But they don't feel too big without socks either. If you're worried about them looking too big, don't be. Because of the style they don't look large at all.  Because they have a heel that measures measures approximately 2 inches and the platform is about 3/4 inches, they make you appear taller too which I think helps with the appearance of looking slimmer.

It puts an end to digging through your suitcase to find that pair of socks that has somehow worked it's way into a bottom corner.  It also makes packing easier.  Can't remember if you packed undershirts and maybe their on the bottom?  Instead of having to unpack the entire suitcase and repack it, just pull out the top couple of cubes and locate then one with the shirts then toss them all back in.  5 seconds of work.

positive,5.0,"This watch may be the biggest bang for buck purchase I have made all year! Basic, yes. Simple, yup. Quality, definitely. The case is well finished and feels good. The size is perfect for a med/large mens watch. The design is great and not too ""Submarinery"". The face of the watch is well done with applied indices. The face finishing does seem to have a slight waver for the nit-picky people out there (depresses ever so slightly around the indices). A matte or satin face would be an improvement IMHO. The strap that comes with it feels cheap, but is really comfortable. Overall, I love this watch. It looks awesome, feels good, keeps good time and seems to be pretty durable. Although time will tell on that last one (durability), based on Casio's reputation on this front I am betting I am in good hands. Skip the expensive fashion-divers and get yourself this Casio.

positive,5.0,"these shoes feel comfortable, albeit slightly larger than I would've prefered (I am between a 7.5 and an 8, but on a shoe that runs large, I sometimes need to go to a 7.5 --- but I've always been, thankfully, warned by other reviewers that a manufacturer runs big for the size and ordered correctly).  these are not so large that I would need to return them, just a little larger than what I usually receive in an average 8.  color wise- these are much brighter than I expected from the pictures.  i expected these shoes to be redder than the actual color, which is a very bright hue - almost a pinkish red.  that's not necessarily a bad thing, but, for my tastes, these look more like pink of my wife's nike's than (for instance) the red of a pair of classic chucks. when you really sit and look at them, there is no question they are red, but, in passing, the brightness of the red makes them look pink.

overall, a good pair of shoes for the money.",Please with the shoes for the money.
positive,5.0,"I own the older version of this watch. In 1989 I became a certified diver and need a reliable watch to go under with. I purchased the older version of the same watch back then and it is still going strong! I never gave it a second thought until last week when I had to change the battery. I took it in and asked the tech to check the water resistance on it just for laughs as I don't use it for diving any more. It passed the 200 meter test with flying colors! I was amazed but the tech wasn't because he know how solid the watch was and told me that it's one of his best sellers!

After 24 years of use, countless bands and battery replacements, the watch is still as amazing as the day I bought it. It shows it's age as coral and sand are unforgiving, but the watch is an amazing performer. I will never replace it with a newer watch because I want to see how long it will really last.

positive,5.0,"I received this necklace yesterday, in a beautiful, elegant box.  The necklace is truly unique.  It is the perfect length, it sparkles across the room, the gemstone, the Druzy itself is remarkable.  Itis in perfect proportion with the length of the necklace and the size of the stones.  Although I received this at a discount in exchange for a fair and unbiased review, I am ordering two additional necklaces for my daughters.","in a beautiful, elegant box"
positive,5.0,"It is so perfect! fits exactly as described by there measurement chart! and it's perfect for my long torso!
It is definitely steel boned, but not with SUPER restricting bones and it's super comfortable.
It got here early, in perfect condition.

It's a little tricky to close the busk in the front, but I attribute that to the length of the busk and the steel boning, not because of poor design. It is also fairly easy to lace up on my own too! To lace it up I work from the bottom to the center, then the top to the center. The lacing doesn't slip and loosen when you let go, making it VERY easy to lace it on your own!
The waist obviously isn't as dramatic since you have to work your way to that kind of waist, but it's still fantastic!

Will definitely be buying from this seller again! <3",LOVE THIS CORSET!

positive,4.0,"Good pants. I have several pairs of these now as they fit me quite well. Not too slim as to look silly but they are slim through the thighs and in the seat. There is some variability in sizes as one might expect in mass-produced pants at this price. These fit tighter in the waist than a pair of blue sharkskin pants, but less tight than navy pinstriped pants of the same model. Length appears to be pretty consistent.  6'1"", 170lbs for reference. 32x32 fit well, as I prefer these in between no and half break. They fit about the same through the thighs as Levi's 513 jeans, but are straight from the knee rather than tapered. Not as full as the Levi 514. Length shouldn't be compared to those low rise jeans, though, as the waist on these pants is NOT low rise. They would look silly if you attempted to wear them below your natural waist. I would like maybe another half inch let out, but it's not worth it.

The amount of fabric left in the hems is more than average when you to have a tailor hem unfinished dress slacks. I imagine this is to permit greater flexibility in letting out the pants. It does, however, mean that the pants do not lay quite as well as unfinished pants that are hemmed -- especially if you are wearing them where you have a full break.

Amazon shipped these in a plastic bag, wrapped in a plastic bag. Plan on pressing them and hope the post doesn't puncture the bag (and the pants). Mine were fine but it seems a distinct possibility that SOME shipments will be damaged.",Good pants at a reasonable price

positive,4.0,"My original Casio sports band was tearing so I bought the Casio replacement band.  The band itself is great and is an excellent replacement.  It fit the watch perfectly (25mm width and 16mm spring bars).  I originally bought my watch (the G-Shock AWG1001A) in 2010 which is little older than the G-Shock models listed in the band description.  I was able to perform the replacement using a small 5mm flat blade screw driver but if you want an easier time I strongly suggest you buy a watch spring bar tool for spring bar removal and insertion.

My only criticism is the lack of a diagram showing how to do the replacement.  However I did find videos posted on the web that walked through the procedure.  If you neeed a replacement band for your G-Shock watch then I highly recommend this band.",Good Replacement Band
positive,4.0,"I normally wear a 9.5 but it's slightly too big, which is why I gave it minus 1 star.

The over all style and quality of the shoe is exactly what I expected based on the description and images of the shoe. I've had Steve Madden shoes before and they are not the most comfortable shoes out there but I won't be standing all day in these shoes so they work for me. As for the quality of the shoe, the stitching seemed to be fairly good and my previous pair of Steve Madden shoes are still holding up despite being several years old so I would expect the same out of these.

positive,5.0,"This is my wedding ring of choice, after searching with the help of my now wife, for something that would be extremely sturdy with a dark wood grain built into it. Tungsten is an excellent material choice which doesn't cost much at all, and it looks just like silver with none of the drawbacks. This thing takes damage like it's nothing, leaving no trace of very hard dings against various surfaces throughout the day. It has a dark color tone to the metal while still catching light with a rich feel to its overall outward appearance. The Koa wood inlay is very well done and does not separate from the metal like many rings of this type seem to, according to many Amazon reviews I read on other rings like this one.

positive,5.0,"I had a favorite white shirt that I wore primarily as a smock. I recently stained it and soon despaired of finding another one like it, when I looked at the label to see if there was a clue as to where I might be able to find it as the Internet wasn't showing me anything even close. The label didn't give me a name, but as I'm hanging it back up I see embroidery beneath the collar that read, ""Foxcraft.""  I did a search and it was just that simple. I purchased 2 of them in different sizes; one for dress and for a smock. The fabric is soft and doesn't need ironing, but if you do iron it you'll find that it irons like a dream because it is so well made. One other thing that I really liked was the packaging. NO PINS to take out. It is held with something that just pops open with a little tug. Love it.  I should add that the price is great.

positive,5.0,"I bought one of these shirts in charcoal at a local surf shop this summer and love how it fits and the material seems like it will last a while.

I am 6'3"" 225lbs and normally wear XL shirts so they aren't too big feeling but the surf shop only had XXL so I tried it on and it fit well so I went with it (this XXL doesn't seem as baggy when you wear it like some XXL can).  I am not drying the shirt because it fits just right so don't want to mess that up.  I wanted to get a few other colors in this style so like everything else in this world I decided to look on here and what do you know they have it and its prime (and the price was right, cheaper than some online surf shops and def cheaper than in the store).

positive,5.0,"....a short and sweet story about this model (formally model 6309)of Seiko watch.  In February of 1978 I was in a specialized unit of the Air Force and had just arrived at Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines. I needed a good watch as my old Timex had just broken.  I went to the BX and bought this watch for $110.  Most expensive watch I had ever owned but I needed a good one and figured this was it.  I wore that watch on my left wrist everyday, all day for 22 and a half years! There is no embellishment here.  I sent it in every 5 years or so for a cleaning and adjustment and that's it!  How many bands did I replace?  I couldn't tell you how many bands and band pins I replaced on that watch.  It went with me everywhere through my youth to middle age.  It is truly like an old friend - the things we had done and the things we had seen - death, destruction, sea depths, high altitude, girl friends, wives, marriages, divorces, child birth, child graduation. Incredible! The day the jeweler told me it was wore-out and could no longer keep good time was the day I put it in my safety deposit box.

 ---I bought the same model watch the next day.  It has been on my wrist, ticking away, since June, 2000 -  just as faithful as my old friend who now lies resting after a long and storied career.

If you need a good watch and one that will last, I can recommend this one.

Update...12.20.15  The Seiko SKX173I bought in 2000 is still going strong after 15 1/2 years.  This watch will take me into old age.  I'm slowing down now and not nearly as active so I believe this watch may last longer than the last one.  My kids can have it when I'm gone - to do with it as they please.  They do know what these watches mean to me.

Update: 4.17.17.  Going on 17 years.  Still going strong.

There are other watches out there.  Some are digital and others are bigger and still others are more expensive. But, in my book, you can't buy a BETTER watch.",You may not believe this but...

positive,5.0,"A little context before I begin the review of THESE pants...

I searched for weeks for a good brand of work pants and the list of choices was a bit overwhelming. After much reading I was ready to try the pants on, if I could find them locally. I tried on Dickies, Wranglers, Carhartts, Craftsmans, Outdoor Life, etc. I was extremely disappointed in all of them. Regular fit, slim fit, straight fit, it didn't matter. They all felt strange for one reason or another. Too tight, too stiff, too thick, too thin, too many pockets, not enough pockets, pockets too small, pockets too big, pockets in weird positions, etc.

Then I came across these at Sears. There was only one pair in my size and due to the abuse by customers and employees so the pants had a tiny hole near the knee. It didn't matter to me because right when I touched these pants, they felt comfortable in my hands. I instantly knew they would be comfortable wearing them as work pants. I was right. I tried them on. The label said that they were traditional fit--they sit at the waist so I'm not going to show my crack to anyone standing behind me. There was enough room in the legs and throughout the pants for me to be able to move without being too baggy. Did I mention how comfortable they felt? The leg openings were large enough to fit over my boots without qualifying as disco pants. Pockets galore. The only knock knock would be they the side pockets sit lower than what I would have preferred because wearing kneepads restricts access to the right pockets. And about the comfort. Anyway, like I said, I found these pants at Sears so I bought them right then and there.

I liked them so much I went to another Sears but they didn't have my size so I came to Amazon and found them here for a great price. Not as cheap as Sears with their 50% discount but well worth the money spent.",After dozens of pants...these are the winners.
positive,5.0,"I know my size and I hate shopping.  So far, I've bought five pair of these from Amazon and I don't have to leave the house to do it.  I typically get a few years out of a pair before they're due for reassignment to lesser activities, but I only throw them away after they no longer keep my man parts out of the weather.  If these last as long as they have in the past, my next purchase will be stretch pants for a trip to the early bird buffet.",Second order; they're just fine
positive,4.0,"I Ike the size of this very reasonably priced bag. Big enough for several thick  folders, a wallet, big glasses case, wallet, Ipad, phone. The odor mentioned by some reviewed is there but not extreme, although if I left this bag on my car for a few hours on a hot summer day when I first got it, I might have a different view. I think the smell has faded enough that it won't be an issue. Good value for the price.",Smells a little but nice bag for the $$$$

positive,4.0,"I have several pairs of Timberland boots and love them all. This pair is no exception. Great quality. Sturdy and durable. Cute and versatile. The only difference that sticks out is that it isn't as comfortable as my other pairs. It's kind of stiff all around (including the foot bed), but perhaps that'll change with more use. It's not a huge issue though - I can still wear these throughout a work day without any problems.

I got the rawhide forty color. The leather is a dark, subtle reddish brown. It's also very stiff and smooth at first, but develops large visible folds/wrinkles very quickly - I think this just adds character to the boot. I can wear these with just about anything.

The sizing is tricky. I'm normally a 7.5 (sometimes 7) and I've never needed a wide width. After reading reviews, I chose a 7 wide, which fit almost perfectly (it's just a little narrow still). So, I think this boot runs slightly long and very narrow. I also have some difficulty getting my feet in them - even with the zipper open, the entrance is a bit too small - but this isn't a huge issue either.

Overall, I really like the boot because it's versatile, cute, and seems very sturdy. I'm just deducting a star because it's not particularly comfortable or easy to get on - but again, maybe those things will improve as the leather breaks in.",Great boot with a few flaws and tricky sizing

positive,4.0,"These Duduma Premium full mirrored sunglasses are just what I expected... basic and inexpensive!

The size of the frames are reasonable, but if you have a larger head they might be snug. I have an average sized head and they fit great! They are definitly not for anyone with a big head. The tint Is completely mirrored. I purchased the red/gold pair and I must admit for the price they are a great pair of stylish and functional sunglasses. They do not compare to Ray Bans ofcourse but in my opinion spending a fortune on named brand glasses such as these with the tint isn't justifiable because they aren't everyday glasses for me.

positive,4.0,"My arches are very high, and in the summertime my Fitflops conform to my feet like a firm version of memory foam, helping alleviate pain from plantar fasciitis. I've been wearing cheap slippers for too long & my feet hurt, so I shelled out to get some REALLY GOOD slippers like these.

They're a little tight in the toes, and take a while to break in, but I really do love them. I suppose if I spent more time standing up, they'd break in faster! At first they felt very hard and cold but after a few hours I was reluctant to take them off. After wearing them for about 6 weeks now, they're starting to conform to my feet and feel good. Even though the backs are open, they are quite warm and cozy.

The bottoms are extremely thick and waterproof, so I have no problem going outside in a little bit of snow or rain to get my dog if I need to. That was a must, for me!

They're taking longer to break in than I expected, but I do love them so. I feel like the long break-in period means they will not fall apart easily and I can wear them for many winters to come. They are VERY good quality, solid, warm, and well-constructed. Much pinker than in the photo! Pretty close to Barbie Pink, which is a bonus for me but may not be for you!",Love Fitflops!

positive,5.0,"This neck warmer arrived just in time.

Seven degrees, -12 windchill, and snow blowing the driveway!

It's medium weight microfleece and it works.

There was no snow on my neck to melt and freeze. My neck.....Stayed warm.

Is it good quality? I couldn't even find a thread to trim.

Will it stay in place? The adjustable, elastic cord holds firmly.

What's the catch? Just that you'll have to wait until it arrives to wear it.

Complete coverage is key to staying warm and this covers an area that sometimes isn't, and needs to be.

I recommend spraying it with a water repellent so that it can't absorb moisture. With your body heat and snow, it could become damp and be less effective. If you will not be around snow or any precipitation, don't worry about it, I spray everything I wear because I often am. I also have neoprene gear, but that's not as comfy as this.

Just pull it over your head, tighten it around your chin and if you get too hot, pull it down and pull it back up when you want to.

It's a great item if you aren't in the south during the winter, where I should be in -12 degree weather.

Luckily, I planned on hanging it from it's integral loop, from the outside of my purse. Hopefully it will stay there till I need it. It took several minutes to figure out how to open it, since there are no instructions and I didn't want to use so much strength that I might break something that wasn't supposed to be movable.

positive,5.0,"This is a beautiful and impressive looking watch. It is easy to set the time and date, and easy to use the extended stop watch style function. Even more impressively, the manufacturer thoughtfully provides a link tool so that you can adjust the band without resorting to paying a jeweler. They even emailed a new version of the product manual upon receipt of my order, feeling that the enclosed manual needed an update.

The face is large and easy to read, and the platinum color of the band and the watch case is pleasant.

positive,5.0,"I purchased this petticoat based on the measurements and sizing provided in the item description, and found that for me it did fit true to size. It's a great crinoline overall. A little long for me (5'4"") but that's easily solved by wearing it a little higher on my waist. The lining isn't the greatest and it can get a little itchy at times. I wouldn't plan to wear it very long without nylons, tights, biking shorts, etc on underneath. I bought the navy color and found that it was a true navy blue in person, unlike the brighter blue it appeared on my screen. The fabric is good quality and the construction is great. I expect that this crinoline will hold up well to what I'll be using it for. If you're looking for a true super floofy look, you'll probably need 2 of these. I would guess in the picture, they are doubled up as it doesn't look quite that thick in person - but if you just want a little lift and shape to your skirt and not the full ballgown look, this will do the job nicely!

positive,5.0,What a fantastic price for a high quality pair of boots.  They fit perfect and are modern and stylish.  There aren't a lot of reviews for this item and I decided to try it out anyway since they are so affordable.  As soon as I saw the detail and workmanship that went into these I was excited.  They look and feel as nice as a pair from Fred Meyer's (Kroger in some states) that would cost $80-$100 and are way better than the affordable boots that I have purchased from many stores in the mall. A lot of those don't come in half sizes like these did.  They came in a a boot box with shoe stuffing in them so they could be easily wrapped and given as a gift.  The heels are just the right length and are thick and well made and the zippers are good quality and easy to zip.  The material used is sturdy and thick too and the buckles look great.  I have six other pairs of boots and some are designer boots that are flimsy compared to these.  I will definitely order more boots from this seller and would strongly recommend this pair of boots. Please see my photos for an example. Thanks!,Stylish high quality boots that fit perfect

My only complaint is that it does not have a shoulder strap but I can sew one on pretty easily!",Great little bag.
positive,4.0,I love the look and the cut but I am confused about the zipper on the side.  It does not help a body to get into or out of it.  Just for looks perhaps?  Once the dress is on it is very flattering! Well made -zipper placement not considered.,well made

positive,4.0,Great boots and warm and waterproof!,Four Stars
positive,5.0,"Love these boots!  I always, always, always order boots/shoes 1/2 size larger when I order over the internet so I ordered these accordingly (an 8-1/2 instead of an 8).  My thinking is if they are 1/2 size too large I can live with that but 1/2 size too small, no can do.  I could definitely have taken these in my normal size (8) but I am happy enough with these in an 8-1/2. They don't flip flop in the back...just more toe room. I have a medium size width foot and these are borderline wide width (definitely not for narrow width person though-they will be too wide).

I like that they don't have a pointy, pointy toe like most cowboy boots.  They have a rounded point if you know what I mean but pointy enough to look like authentic cowboy boots.  The heal height is also perfect for me.  I can't wear high heals anymore so 2-1/2"" is ideal for me.

I ordered them in the gray since I have black boots and brown boots and am very happy with the color.  They are a smoky gray, unlike the picture which makes them look more brownish.

I got these for  30 bucks and can't believe it.  They are comfortable and cute.  I am really happy with this purchase.",What a bargain! True to size.

(I found that the beige runs a bit smaller, maybe 1/2 size smaller than the black. I don't know if this is a quality control issue, or if these were made in different factories.) The black is definitely my favorite. It's drapes beautifully and is long enough to wear comfortably and modestly with leggings.",Love the black - very hip

It has a few pockets on the outside, but it could use an outer pocket that doesn't need to be unzipped to be accessed, such as a mesh pocket that can be used to quickly hold a water bottle or something like that.  The interior is roomy but it could also use a couple small pockets/dividers.  The handle for pulling the bag when wheeling it around has a zipped cover over it.  I suppose that could be useful, but in general I don't keep it zipped and having the unzipped flap there is more of a nuisance than a convenience.  Overall it feels like a solid no-frills bag.",Very spacious

positive,4.0,"Needed an oxblood/burgundy belt to go with some recently purchased oxfords for a wedding, and decided to order this, due to style, buckle, and price.

The black side, which I doubt I will use because I have a nice black belt, looks like decent quality leather. The reverse side, however, as another reviewer mentioned, DOES look like plastic: smooth, shiny, polished and...plastic-like (maybe this is why its description is ""glazed""???). The black is NOT like this, but like true leather.

I ordered a 32, wear a 30, and it fits JUST right, so size is fine.

However, if I can find an oxblood/burgundy that looks more like REAL leather, I will return this. Otherwise I will keep it .",Decent burgundy/oxblood belt.

positive,5.0,"More than anything, this set is a great bargain. It would be hard to put together an outfit at Target for that price and the style and quality exceed what I'd normally get there.

It can be hard to find clothes for little boys that are cute and stylish, but can still take a beating. These wash well, don't shrink too much, and will be outgrown before they can be worn out. It's a super cute little outfit and BLACK! So, although it can get fuzzy, it won't show stains.

I will say the the sizing is a bit on the small side. I'd order up, especially if your child is on the tall and thin side like my son. He'll outgrow the length in the torso soonest. I don't think it's worth docking a star... I wouldn't say it's off by a whole size... but I'd recommend ordering up.

That said, I'll remember this for gifts for kids. Such an adorable outfit that is kid approved and just the right price.",Excellent quality for the low price tag!

positive,5.0,"This is my second pair of Yukon Crocs.  The heels on the first pair were just starting to show some wear but no where near the point of tossing them out.  I wear my Crocs instead of slippers and with a heavy pair of socks, they are good from early spring well into late fall.  During the summer, they are my ""go to"" footwear. I bought this latest pair only because I was going on vacation and wanted to treat myself. The leather tops and straps don't give away that they are what many think are ""hospital shoes"".  With a nice pair of khaki's and a blazer, I've even worn them to court and nobody noticed. Believe me, when you are standing on your feet belting out ""Objection !"", the last thing you want is for your feet to ache. I prefer the khaki color as they look a lot like a casual shoe. Slide the straps forward and they make great slip-ons.  Yukon Crocs are incredibly comfortable, versatile and reasonably priced. My only objection is that they are made in china. If they were made in the U.S., they'd be perfect.",Second pair of Yukon's

positive,5.0,"So like others here, I was looking for an alternative to certain infamous brand that starts with an ""L"" and ends with an ""Ularoe.""

I love leggins.  All leggings.  Leggins with patterns, Leggings with prints, solid color leggings, doesn't matter.  What I don't love is paying $25 for them.  And I'm even less enthusiastic about being forced to attend a multi-level marketing/reverse funnel system ""party"" with distant acquaintances and making awkward small talk while I try to think of an excuse to just get my leggings and duck out early.  That is not my shopping style. That is my nightmare.  I'm definitely more of the do-your-shopping-at-3am-at-the-computer-in-ketchup-stained-undies type of shopper, if you will.

Now I can have it all!  I get cute, comfy leggings, and I get to indulge my crippling social anxiety!  The Viv leggings are just as soft (possibly softer) and as high quality as the other brand.  They don't have the wide waist band style, just the elastic waist style, but it does go all the way up to the waist line, so that works.  Additionally, they are nice and opaque with no awkward crotch bunching.  I'm a size 4, 5'6"" and they fit me perfectly and have a nice length to them.

Also I'm not sure if Viv reads these things, but if they do I wanted to say:

Hey guys I love your brand, but please come out with more patterns!  While I do love paisley and zig-zags, I see a lot of potential for a greater diversity of patterns. And I'm looking to reeeeally lean into my legging addiction hard...  Right now I'm in the ""holding down a job, hiding it from friends and family"" territory.  But I'm hoping to move into the ""barefoot, begging with a cardboard sign at the underpass"" space by the end of next quarter.  I believe you are the brand to take me there.

Anyways, these are my leggings now, and I'm never looking back!",Just gonna buy one more pair then I'll quit.  This time will be different.
positive,5.0,I am very happy with these shoes. My feet are wide and I have a hard time finding shoes that fit me. They even came with an extra pair of shoelaces. I plan to buy another pair when these start to wear out.,very comfortable shoes
positive,4.0,I purchased this item for myself because it was advertised as plus size. I am a size 22 or 3XL. I ordered this in a 3XL and expected it to fit just right. I believe the image is deceptive because the arms on the item are a bit shorter than shown. They are also ruched which causes them to fit a bit tighter on my arm. I would also say this item is shorter than the image appears because it falls just at my waist. I expected it to fall below my waist. The material is soft and the color grey is true. It shrunk only a bit when I washed it. I would recommend this product because it is well made and has stood up to numerous washing sessions. I was able to purchase this item at a discount for review purposes.,Cover-up Cutie

positive,4.0,"Bought these 26 Jun 16 and have been wearing them casually around town, cycling, and running.  I haven't dropped them, sat on them, etc.  When I'm not using them they live in their hard case.  I was out for a walk today (8 Jul 16) and noticed some haloing off the left lens as I was headed into the sun.  I took a closer look and noticed a micro fracture running the length of the lens and several more small ones originating at the nose piece.  These are nice glasses, but they didn't even make it two weeks and I have to send them back to native along with $30.  I'll get my money back if Native determines it is a manufacture defect.  I'll update my review in about 10-15 days once I know the disposition.  My Oakley E-wires last 8 years before any issues.

I only bought these because my original pair that I bought 15 years ago finally wore out--one of the toe straps wore through. I tend to be hard on shoes, and hard on these too. So 15 years is pretty impressive. The cleats do wear down, some more than others, but are good for at least a season, and are easy to replace. I've found that getting a bagful of cleats every other year is enough to replace the ones that wear out.

The new pair look identical to the old ones. Good to see that they haven't messed with a design that works.

They're worth the money. They work. They last for years and years. Get a bag of the cleats so you'll have them ready to swap in at the start of next season.",The old troopers finally needed replacing

It sells at a reasonable price and comes packaged in Amazon's lovely dark-blue boxes.  It is quite an impressive gift.
I have larger wrists and some cuffs look terrible on me but this one is perfect with almost a delicate look.
I like that one of the X pieces is thicker than the other(which I didn't think I was going to like) because it really adds interest and dimension to the cuff.  This is a great addition to many wardrobe styles and will last a long time.",Love this Classy Cuff!

positive,5.0,"I already had the black version of this watch with the blue second hand. That's still my absolute favorite watch ever.  I wanted to buy this one since I liked the other so much.  It gives me a lighter colored alternative.  The carbon fiber in the links and face is a very unique feature.  The watch wears heavy on the wrist which I prefer.  I'm tall with big hands so I love the bigger watch face and feel. This is actually my fourth Precisionist and probably my tenth Bulova.  I used to buy Citizen and Seiko, but have become pretty brand loyal to the Precisionist line of Bulova.  The only thing you have to watch for is the six tiny hex bolts around the bezel.  There's a potential to snag a shirt sleeve now and then, but not anything I really worry about.  I also had to replace the battery on another precisionist a few weeks back.  I was nervous it'd be pricey, but was only around $10.  Not bad at all.  I highly recomend this watch, but guy the black one first.  It'll get you lots of compliments.",Excellent quality for the price range.

positive,5.0,"I ordered these pants at a discount in exchange for my honest review and I am so happy with them! I am 58 140lbs (I carry my extra weight in the baby pouch area) and I ordered the size large in Texas Arch Pomegranate. They fit me great and I was so happy that they are long enough!! In fact they brush the floor just a bit which is the way I was hoping they would fit, just like the Amazon photo. They look very much like the Amazon photo and have a fold over panel. The material is thin, soft, and is cool to the touch. They are very comfortable to wear (I am very picky about comfort) and I think they look good dressed up or just casual with a t shirt. The legs are very wide and sometimes even looks like you are wearing a long skirt, its very pretty. They are flattering and create the look I was hoping for, the thigh part of the leg is a bit more tapered (not much just a tad) so you can see a bit of your leg shape when you walk and then the rest just flows. I have a hard time getting the correct size when ordering online but these work great for me I am really happy. As I said before I am picky about comfort and sensitive to things that are too tight or have seams that rub but I thought these looked comfortable and they truly are. I have worn them all day and don't feel like I need to come home and change right away. The tag says to hand wash these in cold but I put them in the washer on a quick cycle and so far they have done fine. I do hang dry them though just to be safe. Overall I get lots of compliments, and haven't had any quality issues with them.",Very Comfortable for All Day Wear

positive,5.0,"Works great on all of my leather shoes & belts. Reduces visible creases and small marks, evens the color a bit (no color change) and conditions. Does dry to a matte finish, which is a matter of taste, but I do wish I could buff to a shine for some of my shoes without an additional polish step as I condition more often than polishing.  Easy to apply (consistency of a lotion) and doesn't take much to cover a lot of area.",Works great

positive,4.0,"i wear jeans 3 times or so before i wash them, unless they get dirty. if you wear them once and then put them in the wash, you shouldn't run into the issue that i am having. after a long single wear (10 hours or so) or after the 2nd wear, these jeans loosen up a lot - more so than the other brands of jeans that i own. the waist stretches at least an inch, probably more. the legs at the thigh get really get baggy too. if they didn't loosen up so much, i would give these 5 stars, easily. i have been washing them after a single wear, but since i am a single guy and only do laundry once a week, they might sit on a pile for 5 days until i do a wash. so i ""solved"" that problem by buying a 2nd pair. as long as they are right out of the wash, the fit is good. seems true to size. they get a bit longer after a couple wears and bunch up at the shoe.","beyond comfortable, but they stretch out a lot when they soften up after a couple wears"

Fair warning that it has a very strong NEW smell to it when it arrives, but it went away after a few weeks of use.

positive,5.0,"Anything by Pearl Izumi is fantastic.  I used to work in bicycle shops and got great discounts on Pearlie stuff.  I became an addict to this high-end brand.  Pearl Izumi makes the best  and you can't go wrong with them.  The hard part is which item to choose.  Though I am a lady, I always prefer the Men's mediums as they fit perfectly.  (I have larger hands from years of piano and basketball.)

When we ride on the road on our roadbikes, over 1/3 of our weight goes through our arms and into our hands.  So I wanted a glove that replaced my last pair of gel Pearies that finally fell apart after nearly ten years.  These are better.

They have the gel and padding in all the right places and its as if I designed them for myself.  They are breathable and lightweight and the open fingers make riding the road so much more comfy.  There have been a couple of times where I've forgotten my gloves and paid dearly for it.

(I did NOT get paid by Pearl Izumi though I think I should have, lol.  I sing their praises every day.)",Perfect padded gloves for riding on the road

positive,5.0,"I purchased the black ""spinner"" version of this luggage. The quality is great and it is indeed light (just 8.6 lbs, while the rollaboard version (i.e., (non-spinner is even lighter at 7.6lbs). You just have to compare the weight and quality at its price point with the competition and you will see that it blows them away. I actually compared several brands at the local department store. By the way, this luggage (in black) looks just like what you see pilots and flight stewardess carrying on board aircraft. That's perhaps why Travelpro holds itself out to be ""the choice of flight crews (and frequent travelers."")

I am happy that I found great value by finding a great quality product at a good price.

Update as of July 2013:
After using the luggage for awhile, I can say that I would definitely prefer the 2 wheels rather than four for the following reasons:

a) It is difficult to keep a 4 wheeler stationary in one spot. On any surface that is slightly curved, it will automatically slide to the lowest point and this is frustrating especially if you just want it to stay put.
b) I find it easier to drag a two wheeler than to slide a four wheeler.
c) The 2 wheeler is 7.4 lbs vs 8.6 lbs for the 4 wheeler
d) I can't justify a higher price for the 4 wheels based on a) b) and c) above.",Great value and beats the competition
positive,4.0,"Well, my old Adidas duffel that I've had for 20+ years finally gave out and I needed a new bag. I researched for a good bit and knew I didn't need anything especially large. I mainly wanted something that could hold all of my running gear, to keep it all in one place, and be easy to grab on the way out of the door. This bag fits the bill perfectly.

The shoe compartment is actually a tunnel that runs through the main compartment of the bag. I was expecting just a large side pocket, and the tunnel does take up some space within the bag. Even with that, though, I was able to fit a ton of stuff in the bag with room to spare.

It has another large side pocket that is perfect for gels, headbands, whatever other items you may have.  It would've been great had this pocket had a divider so that I could separate things a bit more. The bag is soft and does not have a stability insert for the bottom. I happen to like this, as I prefer my bag to mold to me a bit and not be too stiff. This bag molds great and is easy to carry.

I gave this bag 4 stars as the material feels sort of cheap. One other reviewer compared it to a reusable shopping bag, and I would say it feels about the same. However, my reusable shopping bags have taken a lot of wear, so who knows. I doubt this bag will last the 20 years my last one did, but overall, it is functional, form fitting, holds a ton and is very nice looking.",A solid buy

positive,5.0,"Received my new lenses today for my original Twenty X (XX) frames that I bought in 2001.  I was skeptical when ordering them, but the price was fair and there were good reviews.  The lenses are excellent, packaging was very nice (a little 2 pouch bag to keep the lenses separated), and they look nice.  The fit is snug and you have to put them in ""just right"" or they won't fit, but that's a good thing.  Original Oakley lenses aren't quite as snug but I don't see any problems with popping out and swapping lenses now that I know these run snug and I know how to put them in properly (outside edge in first, then snap the inside edge in).  5 stars and I WILL order other lenses.  I have polarized red and polarized black lenses from Walleva now, and I don't think I'll be ordering original Oakley lenses again.  That is... unless these don't last.

I was cautiously optimistic when it arrived, but I'm so glad I took the chance! It's super comfortable with some padding, but not a ridiculous amount. This may sound a little weird, but the band felt super soft - I have really sensitive skin, so some bra bands feel really scratchy and irrating, but this one actually felt super nice.

positive,5.0,"I had this bag in my shopping cart for months!  I just couldn't make up my mind.  It just looked practical and different.  My big concern was the notes people had made about how short it is when worn across the body.  As a chubby lady thought this might be an issue.

I finally bit the bullet and bought it and I'm glad I did!  I find the crossbody fit to be pretty comfortable - though I've been losing a lot of weight so it's been fitting better and better.  I'm 5'4"" and wear a size 16 pants and it crosses over my body to rest right above and on my hip.  I find that works just fine for me.  People also commented that the strap is wide, which is true.  But I haven't found it to be uncomfortable even with stiff felt.

It had never occurred to me until I read another review on here about how having a bright liner made things easier to find inside.  *Forehead slap* I can't believe I'd never thought of that, seriously!  I had just thought the contrast with the dark grey and light blue looked cool but it even serves a good purpose!  I rarely carry my ipad around but the padded area in the middle holds it well and is lightly padded.  I do manage to get a lot of stuff in there and can even zip the top. I usually carry:  a small umbrella, a water bottle, a big billfold, a portable charger, snack bar, small emergency bag with earplugs, benadryl, aspirin, eyedrops, alcohol wipes..yes I'm that person.

I never use the buttoned part of the bag.  I wish the buttons were decorative and there was a metallic closure because it's a little tedious to have to undo each button. I've considered altering it myself to do this but I'll probably never get around to it. It is fairly easy to unbutton with the flexible felt though.  I spilled some coffee on it a few weeks ago and didn't notice for a few weeks.  It dabbed right off with a wet cloth.  I'm probably going to spray it with some scotch guard just in case.

To sum up, I'm really glad I bought this bag!  It's cute and holds a lot of stuff.  And I've gotten some nice compliments on it.",Crossbody size works fine for me

positive,5.0,"We were looking for a shoe horn for several reasons. 1) Hiking boots purchased for my husband were not very flexible, backside of them would fold down when he tried to get his foot in. Once he got his foot in, the boots fit perfect. 2) Ski boots are always a struggle, someone suggested getting a shoe horn for this reason. 3) My husband was having surgery and would not be able to fully bend down for several weeks. He would need help getting his shoes/boots on. Searched on Amazon and found this. This shoe horn has been amazing for all 3 of the reasons we wanted one. It is very well made and thick. Does not bend, so it is perfect for getting feet into ski boots, and stiff shoes/boots of any kind. If you are older, having surgery, or have any kind of issue that makes it difficult to put your shoes on, this shoe horn has a great length and the solid stiff design prevents it from flexing as you use it. Now my husband can get his feet into his boots without issue, my kids get their feet into their ski boots without complaint, and my husband doesn't have to bend too far to get his shoes on now that he is healing from his abdominal surgery.

I wanted to step up to the Phoenix 5 but couldn't fin d my size. I read a review that talked about the Exalt being akin to the Phoenix. I ordered them and I'm glad I did. The cushioning w a more secure over lay that holds my foot better than the Phoenix, is exceptional. They give me that spring through my calf that really helps with my form when I'm getting tired..The shoe is off set just enough, slightly lower in the heel, that helps with my landing transition. Great shoe! My Exalt, Brooks Ghost 6 and Asics gel Nimbus 15 I alternate on my runs( 10-20 miles per week) and the Exalt and Ghost are the two favorites. The Ghost 6 is suppose to be a neutral shoe but the inner foot foam build up gives me more of a stability feel, where the Exalt, also a neutral shoe, gives me not as much in the arch but has great control.

positive,5.0,"This costume is fantastic, I have to say. It wears well, and it does so for a good price. I was initially skeptical of buying this costume when originally shopping for a good Spider-Man costume. So, I read the reviews, weighed the pros and the cons, and looked at customer photographs before deciding to go for it. I have not been disappointed.

I originally ordered this costume in, I think, October of 2016. Now, a year later, I am still enjoying the costume. I wore it to the Spider-Man: Homecoming premiere, and fans and friends alike enjoyed it! I also more recently wore it to a local community center play day for the kids. They enjoyed it immensely. And, as it comes to kids, I found myself doing all kinds of acrobatic things. I did hand stands, cartwheels, splits, and plenty of running around, and the costume has held up. And, at the premiere, I jumped onto things and off things (within good reason), and never had any issues with the suit. Definitely a win-win.

Now, as others have said, the costume does have a red mesh where the nose and mouth are. And if someone is up close and personal, they will possibly be able to see your mouth and nose. It does, however, making breathing a bit easier, and doesn't detract from the overall appearance of the costume. And if you were to stand a few feet back, you can hardly notice it. The mesh for the eyes isn't the easiest thing to see out of, but it's not exceedingly impossible. In the daytime, anyhow. At nighttime, I probably wouldn't really attempt to walk around with the mask zipped up without a bit of help. Overall, not a deal breaker.

I should probably also add that wearing an undergarment beneath your costume is probably a very good idea. I've stuck with a pair of compression shorts that aren't really visible and work well with the suit.

One last thing regarding size-- we're probably all wondering ""will it fit me""? Having ordered another super hero suit, I found that the other suit was appropriately slim-fitting, but still a touch baggy in the waist area. So, I went with a smaller size. As a guy who is 5'6.25"" and 122 lbs, and who generally falls more into the large size category for a suit like this, I bought a medium instead. The medium is appropriately snug, but still allows for plenty of movement, and fits a bit better than my other super hero costume.

All in all, if you're looking for a cheaper cosplay outfit or something to wear for Halloween or to conventions or birthday parties and events, this is definitely worth a buy. Perhaps not so much if you're looking for absolute screen-accuracy, but it definitely feels like you're stepping right out of the comic books the moment you put it on. Of course, the brighter colors probably help with that, and wonderfully so!","Affordable Quality Costume, Just Like Stepping Out of a Comic Book"

This one has a toe strap that wraps around your big toe, ok, with that said, if you have or have had bunions skip this sandal, as your big toe angles outward this toe strap pushes back as if your toe is pointing straight ahead, and you will be ready to take these off in 2 hrs if even that.  I had foot surgery on my left foot long ago and do notice that my left toe becomes sore after about 4 hrs in this sandal, but I still love this shoe for all of its other comfort.  The size 9 does seem to be a bit longer and my toes don't come to the edge of the sandal, great if your a 9-1/2. Even so I like the look wearing it and it is the great FitFlop sole.","Not for  ""all toes"""

positive,4.0,"Absolutely love this dress! Just received it. It is a one piece dress not a skirt & top. Ordered the pale pink/black and the teal/navy. The material is thick but clingy. Being that it is 103 degrees here, these pictures were taken without my Spanx. It will look so much better with the Spanx. The dress shows all of my fat rolls; however, this is a must have! I typically wear an 8 and a 6 depending on how the garment is made. I ordered the medium. The tag says size 6. I am 5'4"" and weigh 145lbs.. 34C. The top was just a little big under the arms but not noticiable. The bottom is tastefully fitted (lose enough that it is not too tight...comfortable). The ONLY thing I do not like is that the zipper color is the color of the top and it stands out. But, I will more than likely order this dress in a few other colors. The more curves, the better this dress will look. I only gave it 4 stars because of the zipper.",***A Wardrobe Must Have***

Ok, it's a bag.  Lets all keep that in mind, but the thing is incredible.  So, where to start.  I have owned more than a few brief cases, and there fine for the trips and when I have to pack a large amount of paperwork.  I have been looking for something I can take to the office and coffee shop and this is it.  It is nearly indestructible.  I mean, the more you beat it, the better it looks.  Also, it is far larger than you think.  I am 6'2"" and it is a perfect fit for my size.  It can hold all my files and my laptop / ipad easily .  And finally, it looks great.  Like really great.

positive,5.0,"I love, love, love these shoes. They are the most comfortable shoes Frye makes. I have 7 pairs. I would buy them in every color of the rainbow if they offered them. People run up to me on crowded streets to ask me where I got them, no kidding. (one woman almost got hit by a city bus...) These are ""it"" shoes!
I ticked the box for ""fits as expected"" because I know that they run about 1/2 size large. I'm normally a size 9 in non-Frye shoes, and in these I need an 8 1/2. They run long. If my feet were narrower, I could have gone with an 8. In light of that comment, an explanation: the 8 1/2s  felt snug widthwise on my medium/wide (buniony) feet when I first put them on, but they stretched to fit beautifully (it was the same with all seven pairs). The 8s were much tighter than that. I don't think they would have stretched to fit my width as well as the 8 1/2s.

They look great with  dresses, jeans, skirts, capris and even winter shorts with tights. I seriously love these shoes. I want them all! I wish they'd make bright blue, olive green, yellow and purple! I need a backup red pair very soon. Expensive, but worth every penny.

positive,4.0,"For starters I'm 5'5"" about 175 lbs size 16. They fit great, snug just as they should be. They stretch to accommodate various sizes but I wouldn't buy if you're very much bigger than I am as they will not fit comfortably. Length is good as well, will work ok if you're a bit taller but if you wear with boots, length won't matter so much. Looks great with boots and a long sweater. A little on the thin side so not ideal for a harsh winter but not thin enough to almost see through. They look as pictured. Would buy again.","Looks great, fits great."

positive,5.0,"I don't know why Corso Como don't make these anymore- Ive gone through like 10 pairs of these. My best guess is they had too many returns because they don't last very long, which makes me wonder why they don't just reduce the price (I think the retail was $60).These are not for walking outside on grass or at the park because the sole is so thin - one time a twig went straight through and poked my foot. Theyre more for just walking on dry clear areas in good weather.","Good, very comfortable"

I bought this design becuase I already have it in a bigger and much more expensive bag.  Love this one as much.",Can't imagine anything better for the price
positive,4.0,"This backpack is pretty much what I expected -- I'm not a backpack person (never was, even in school, but my chriopractor recommended it), so I'm having some trouble adjusting to smoothly getting it on, off, and getting things into and out of it. Because of my unfamiliarity with backpacks, I do think this could be an issue with me and not the bag.  It's also a little tight for all the things I routinely carry, so I have to make things fit as opposed to just popping things in as with a larger shoulder bag. (As with most Baggallini products, the credit card slots and internal 'organization' is worthless.)

It is very light and comfortable and more chic looking than a 'regular' backback so it can work with business casual and not ruin the outfit.  I'm only giving it four stars because the straps aren't adjustable and that's a problem.  They are about 3-4 inches too long and so it kind of bumps against my lower back, instead of fitting more snugly to the middle as it would if I could adjust it those critical inches. I do like the fact that it can be zipped and re-clipped to be a one shoulder sling, which I do if I'm going to be getting into and out of it a lot as opposed to just walking around somewhere.

All in all, I'm pleased, but I don't think I'd feel four stars pleased if I hadn't gotten a good sale price.",This backpack is pretty much what I expected -- I'm not a backpack ...

positive,4.0,"This swimsuit is very cute and well made. I like the orange and navy color, and my husband says the suit is flattering.
It would be more flattering if the sizing was more true to size. It seems that most swimsuits are made in China and they don't seem able to get the sizing correct.
I love the top of this swimsuit. It came with those padded cup liners, but I took those out and threw them away. They are always way too small for me.  This swimsuit does not have an underwire, but it supports me very well. It has spaghetti straps underneath the thick top straps that hold everything in place. The rouching also holds the tummy in.
I don't like the bottoms very much. In the picture on the listing they look like boy shorts. What I received looks more like traditional bikini cut. They are a little small, but thankfully the top covers them most of the time.
If the bottoms looked more like the photo and the sizing was better, this would be 5 stars. As is, it's still a decent suit. The top is better made than some of the way more expensive suits I've tried on.

positive,4.0,"These boots seem very sturdy and undestroyable, and of high quality. True to size. The leather is thick and very nice looking and the details (stamping and lace hooks) are pretty. The soles are very (unusually I would say) thick. I really liked the leather lining - silky and so soft, you won't hurt your bare ankles wearing shorter socks.

I only wore the boots around the house, so I can't comment on how they hold up, though I'm sure they would do a superior job. I returned them because they are VERY heavy. I was going on vacation intending to walk for hours (8+) every day - I thought that these would make my legs tired sooner. I tried on many hiking boots before leaving and weighed all of them. Most were 13 oz, one or two pairs 16 oz, these were 19. Doesn't sound like a big deal, I know. But I could really feel the weight. 6 extra oz per step, thousands step per day - I think it would add up.

I chose Anhu Montara in Red Mahogany and fell in love with them during my vacation, never wanted to take them off! My second choice was Merrell Azura Carex in wine color (yes, I did want boots in as close to red color as possible) but I didn't believe their soles and they were not vibram. These Teva boots were my third choice.
For colder weather or really tough hikes I would choose Keen Gypsum. I was so sorry to let them go! So comfortable. I'm still thinking about getting them back.","very well made boots, nice color and cute details - but heavy"
positive,5.0,I love these sandals! They look great. Very comfortable. Nice to find leather shoes esp for such a low price. I think they fit perfectly.

positive,5.0,"This hat/hood/scarf/mittens combo is just about the cutest thing I have ever worn. My husband won't let me wear it out of the house if we're together (he says he's embarassed) but even he admits that it's adorable. I wore it once to run errands on a Saturday, and I got a lot of double takes and then genuine eye-contact smiles. Sure they could have been laughing AT me, but usually when that's the case, the other person doesn't meet your eyes. It is always my goal to make strangers smile. Come to think of it, I don't even mind if they are laughing at me.

The fur is so soft, it fits nicely (does ride back if you have the scarf/paws in front of your body, so you have to play around with the feel that you think looks best with your hairdo). It's very very warm, so it does it's job, too. Be careful driving with it on, as it doesn't move with your head, so turning or seeing your blind spot can be a problem! I would advise NOT wearing it while driving. But you can just move the head part back like a hood, and the scarf/paws keep it on your shoulders very easily. I want to buy this in every color. Well worth the very low price (I think it was $10 when I got it).",Soft and adorable

I prefer hooded robes because a towel wrapped for my hair never stays put.

positive,5.0,"Just got my watch and I love it.  The center section of each link is brushed metal and the outside is polished (from the picture, I thought it was all polished).  This is what I would have chosen, i think it will show wear less this way, and I'm planning to wear it for a loooong time.  I'm enjoying it as a fairly loose bracelet with no links removed.  Since it tends to hang just in the indent above my thumb bones, I think it will be exposed to light more  when I'm wearing long sleeves, and I can more easily see the face without moving my sleeve.  With high contrast between the hands and the back, it's easy to read even in quite low light. My last watch had gold hands and gold face - It was hard to read in anything but full sun.  I'm 67 but have good eyesight and I can read the date, though it is small.

I love that I can wear it in the shower and swimming.  If I don't have to take it off, I don't have to worry about losing it or forgetting to put it back on.","Great price, classy looking, sturdy, water resistant and no battery change - what more could you ask for."

positive,5.0,"First, let me say that I wear size 15. I only buy shoes online. The big men's stores stock garbage as far as shoes.  My right foot is a little larger than my left, my left being more like a 14 1/2.  With these Bogs, I detect a tiny bit of snugness in the toe area on the right foot. This is why I said ""somewhat small."" Nothing major, and not uncomfortable at all.  I just got them a little while ago, and have worn them several times already. Obviously not what you need for deep snow. But after the deep snow is cleaned up, there are many days of slush and muck. Just slip 'em on.  Nice tread on the bottom, kind of like a snow tire. Totally sealed and waterproof, and my feet stay warm walking through the slush. I would not want them larger because they stretch around the ankle area and fit tight to the foot, so no snow gets in. There were a few other choices as far as this kind of shoe. I am really glad I chose these, and the price was reasonable also. I'll get a lot of use out of these shoes.","Waterproof, warm, easy to put on"

I've been showing it off and recommending it to everyone I see struggling with too many bills and cards. Give up the leather and flaky flimsy money clips.

Update 10/5/16:
Still the last wallet you'll ever need. I swear these guys should hire me as a salesman. I'm in retail and see hundreds of people with bad leather wallets, paper clips, binder clips holding 15 cards and stacks of bills. I so them pull my Trayvax axis out and send them to your site.

I am extremely impressed with these button pearls and the packaging they came in -- it's a pretty good indication of a company's dedication to customer service when a product that barely costs $10 comes in a velvet gift box further enclosed in a wrappable white box. The pearls themselves are dainty and quite a bright white, and the posts look to be well set. The clasps fit well to the posts, and there was also a pair of small plastic backers included in the velvet box for those who want to make sure the earrings won't go anywhere.

positive,5.0,"This is the perfect tennis shoe for me.  It's light weight, has great traction, the upper is soft so it has a snug fit and doesn't require any break-in.  It's not as supportive as some other shoes (like the Gel-Resolutions), so if you need that, this might not be the shoe for you, but if you're looking for light weight, these are outstanding.

Be warned, these shoes (as all the Asics tennis shoes do, in my experience) run big.  I wear a size 10 in every other shoe I buy, but I always buy 9 1/2 in Asics tennis shoes, and these are no exception.","Great shoe, but buy 1/2 size small"

positive,4.0,"This is a good looking shoe that will do nicely with a suit, or business casual. The dark brown color is perfect to stay current but not be trendy by being too light in color. The cap toe look is sleek and not overdone.  The heel is a little on the wide side but looks ok. The sole silhouette is nice in that it does extend out just a bit. These elements make the shoe look sturdy.  But...this is not high quality upper ""leather"" and the sole is synthetic. The leather on this pair looked a bit shiny and I will have them polished to mat it down a bit. I was not expecting to buy anything close to the Alden and Allen Edmond shoes I own, but these Steve Madden's do look great for a fraction of their cost.

However, I know from experience these shoes will not last, and maybe they're not supposed to since I bought this exact pair on clearance for $40 from Macy's in January this year.  They lasted exactly 9-months before the right heel cracked in half where it meets the sole. I wore this shoe every other day, never in the rain and always used shoe trees. To make matters worse I was quoted anywhere from $50 to $65 from neighborhood shoe repair shops to have them resoled with new heels!  I bought the shoe for $67.99 on Amazon this time and now sadly know and fully expect this shoe will barely get me through the spring of 2016.  Such is the fact for buying shoes made in China.",Good looking shoe that will not last

positive,5.0,"I bought a pair of Bostonian Flex Lites about 5 years ago when I had to find dress shoes that worked for standing all day. I can't say enough about the comfort level of these shoes. I would rather wear these shoes than any tennis shoe I've ever worn. I have to wear these in an industrial environment, so concrete or steel floors and I can stand/walk around for 8 hours with little discomfort compared to any other shoe I've worn in the past. Highly recommended.

The only complaint I have about this particular pair is the color. This is the 2nd pair of Brown Wenham's I've purchased, and the 2nd pair is a much, much darker shade of brown than the first pair and I selected exactly the same options on here as I did the first. So expect a little variance in color from the picture.",Highly recommended. The only complaint I have about this particular ...

positive,5.0,I'm 5'4 150 lbs. I initially bought this dress in a size medium but it fit a bit loose so I decided to order a small  to compare the fit.

positive,5.0,"Wow, these are my new favorite boots! I treated them with Obenauf's and buffed them the next day and they darkened up a nice shade (I got the brown ones) and these have a very cushiony insole and a roomy toe box.  Generally I prefer wide footwear because I have sensitive does, and these just happen to naturally be wide enough to not cause any pinching of the toes. The instep is slightly loose, but I think it might be the reason they are called ""relaxed fit"".  As such, these may not be idea for extended hikes off road, as your foot will likely slide around a bit inside the shoe, but for winter wear and cold weather, they are perfect for my needs. You aren't going to want to walk through very deep snow or anything that is anke keep, as liquid will pass through the goring and into the inside of the boot.  But, if you are going to the mall on a winter day and you have to deal with a little snow and slush and then walk for miles inside a mall, you will really appreciate them and their softness and cushioning.  The memory form is nice for retaining warmth too and shielding you from the cold ground. This is my second pair of Skeckers and have to admit that I never gave the brand any consideration until I got the first pair of slip on shoes last year that also have the memory foam and they became my go-to shoes for easy on access and comfort, and I have been impressed with the way they have worn in and that the sole is not wearing down like other shoes I have tried.  So these seem rugged and comfortable and I think you'll enjoy them if you want cushioning and ease of donning. I recommend Obenaufs or some other waterproofing for extended durability and protection.",Great boots!

I don't have socks for these types of shoes, im also low of money so the ones i find are expensive or out of my reach. And under the fabric is of cores rubber, and it get hot. And my feet sweat quite a bit in them. The fabric (you can tell) is just simple glue connecting it to the rubber. And if you have sweaty feet with no socks they will wear out faster and the fabric will become detached. And that's what happened to mine....

positive,5.0,"I honestly don't know how anyone can look at a ring like this-- especially the center stone-- and care whether or not it's a ""real"" diamond or a Swarovski Zirconia. The end result is the same: A beautiful ring. If you want that diamond look without the diamond price or diamond legacy, then you'll be pleased with what you get here.

The main stone is quite beautiful, as clear stones go. The setting is simple but elegant. The platinum-plated sterling silver ring itself looks great, and feels durable enough, though the insert can be bent if you apply some pressure. The two rings lock together to make a nice set, but honestly, the ""main"" ring is pretty enough to stand on its own.

I'm not the biggest fan of the marketing and legacy of diamonds, so for me this seems like a much better compromise.

positive,5.0,"This is the second pair of FitFlop I own.  I was looking for a pair with about 2 inches height to wear in the house.  My feet are not fully recovered yet from 17-day walk in Paris/London a month ago.  I wore ""Arche"" sandals as recommended by lots of (online) people, however it did not provide enough coushion for my feet for daily 6-8 hours of wallk.  So now I have to wear shoes that provide thick cushion and flexibility.  Fitflop is what I want to try ... it has really cool design these two years.  The first pair is Fitflop Arena sandals (greatly love). Both Arena and Lulu are very comfortable: enough room for my toes, perfect height and flexible footbed for my achy feet/toes.  I certainly will look for the third pair (as house slipper) when temperature drops.  My feet width are normal, I usually wear US size 6.5 or 7.

I don't carry many cards on me so the thinner the wallet the better. However, the leather has started to stretch and unless I keep that leather wallet full of cash, the cards fall out of it very easily.

So I decided to expand my comfort level and go with a non-leather wallet for the first time because let's be honest, 'carbon fiber' just sounds way cooler than leather. And I was provided an opportunity to purchase this at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion so here goes:

I have been using this for over a week and very pleased with the size and construction. I gave the pockets a good tug to see if the seams would stretch but they held taut. The carbon fiber material itself is a bit glossy, but the dark grey is attractive and nowhere near as loud as a glossy leather wallet. I have no idea if the RFID shielding works but as my credit card was recently copied and used at a gas station across the country, every bit of security helps.

Pros:
- Provides easy access to 4 cards and storage on both sides for several more
- Carbon fiber body is very lightweight and visually appealing
- Well-made and sturdy

Cons:
- This wallet won't expand too much and the middle pocket for cash can be hard to open, even moreso if you're carrying more than 6 cards. I have to leave my cash slightly exposed so it makes it easier to pull out

Overall I'm very pleased with this wallet although it is a bit difficult to access the cash pocket. That said, I don't use cash a whole lot these days so having easy access to my credit cards is more beneficial. Definitely recommend this wallet if you're looking for something slim, well-made, and eye-catching.

It's not quite as big as I was hoping (this is because I'm not good at visualizing sizes, not because any info was inaccurate, to be clear lol), but it will definitely serve its purpose.

positive,5.0,"The Via Spiga coat/jacket is just right for me.  The fit, the fabric, the tailoring, and the camel color were better than I expected.  I am a taller person (5'9"") and can sometimes have problems with sleeve length and the waist being too short...not this time.  In the image the sleeves look somewhat short, but the sleeves on my coat fall below the wrist, just what I need.  The waist and length are ideal for my (Misses) body type.  I wear a size small in tops (6-8) but like a 10 in a winter coat to fit over heavier, thicker clothes.  This one will do it.  Maybe I should mention that I live in NC where the winters are not usually harsh.  Regardless, this will be a warm coat even when the temperatures are abnormally cold in my area.  I can't say enough good things about this coat.  If you want or need a new/updated coat or jacket, I recommend you try Via Spiga Outerwear.",Via Spiga Women's Double Breasted Belted Wool Coat

positive,4.0,"These Brown Three Flower Squeaky Shoes are so cute and seem well made, even if they did not squeak they are adorable shoes. My granddaughter loved them she is 2 years old, I bought her a size 8. She is into everything so these shoes are great for her mommy to keep an eye or ear on where she is and what she is up to. She really gave them a work out when first putting them on, running around the house squeaking up a storm. So it is good that they are removable squeakers and that they come with a pair of replacement squeakers. Especially since she broke one the first ten minutes of play, but as I said she really gave them a work out. Her daddy did find a pack of reasonably priced replacement squeakers on Amazon that should work in the shoes. Will be ordering them when the ones that came with the shoes are all broken.

positive,5.0,"My old pair of Old Friend slippers finally wore out and I bought these to replace them.  The style is the same, but the new ones have an improved replaceable insole with added support, and I like it. The fleece is thick and soft, warm in the winter and not hot in the summer.

I see a lot of people complaining about the size.  What you have to be aware of is that when you first put them on as new, they will feel small because the sheepskin is very ""fluffy"".  But after you wear them a couple of times, they'll compress in the right places and feel much better.  I know that the product title says ""Extra Wide"" but that seems to be because wide widths are available.  Order the size and width you want.  I'd say that the size runs true once broken in.  Of course, check the size stamped on the bottom of the sole to make sure you got what you ordered.

I have tried many different brands of sheepskin slippers, and keep coming back to Old Friend.

positive,4.0,"2017 UPDATE
Bought 4 of these last year.  Loved them.  The one received  last week was noticeably thinner, less quality than the ones I bought last year.  Probably  won't  buy these anymore.

CON:
First off, star deducted was because it isn't fleece.  The material is more like those soft blankets so common these days.  It looks more casual and bulky looking than I would like.

PROS:
-WARMTH - That said, this keeps me warm, equivalent to a very light down jacket I have.  With a long-sleeved tshirt underneath, I fared 45-49F well.
-COMFORT- This is like wearing a blanket around.  It's soft and cuddly.
-EXTRAS - didn't expect it but there are 2 simple inner pockets.  I ditched the purse for day trips after putting the phone (charger too in some cases), keys and minimalist wallet in the inner pockets.
-GREAT as PJs too. If I new what the material is actually called, I'd get socks/slippers and sweat pants too to complete the PJ ensemble.

Came back and bought more when the site had 25 per cent off coupons for this item, just before Xmas.","REVISED 2017 quality down since 2016.  Not fleece as expected but still love this soft, cuddly and warm jacket."

positive,4.0,I love the way it fits and looks. It's very much like my old military web belts. The only problem is that after one season the paint on the buckle was really scared. I have repainted it with what I hope is a more durable paint. I like the belt so much that I will continue to repaint it when necessary. I think Nike could have found something stronger and more durable.,Great Look

positive,5.0,"I read all the reviews and was concerned about the memory foam being uncomfortable because it doesn't go all the way to the sides, and we are on a tight budget and I don't usually buy this expensive of shoes, but I love purple and really needed a comfy pair of shoes- I work in a hospital and am always on the go.

When I first got them the memory foam felt really firm to the touch and the ""trampolines"" on bottom were just really hard bubbles of plastic/rubber. I wore them to work one day and my feet were in heaven! They weren't really springy, just absorbed the shock of walking, and the memory foam was heavenly on my soles. I only wish there would have been a little more arch support, but I have high arches.

My only real complaint is that on my first day wearing them I wore them to work outside in the rain. They didn't feel very grippy and I almost slipped on a wet wooden deck. I plan to keep them at work though and only wear inside so that won't be a problem for me but definitely something to think about. I couldn't imagine wearing them on snow and ice.",Was skeptical but now I LOVE them!!

positive,5.0,Prefer the Amanda line of jeans. This style is really just barely at the size specified. A 14 is so tight that it's hard to breathe. A 16 requires tucking in and losing one's breath.

positive,5.0,"I purchased this wonderful, flowy, tunic dress in the green in XL, and I adore it! I'm 5'8"", 180, and the fit is pretty spot on! It's very form fitting through the back, chest, shoulders, and arms, and then it flares out substantially below the chest. I almost wish I had tried the large because it's awfully big on me in the waist area, but I'm very broad-shouldered, so I didn't want to take the chance that the large would be too tight through the top.

The dress is your standard tunic polyester/spandex blend, so it stretches considerably, and then it's met on the ends with about eight inches or so of chiffon. It's a bastard to iron! The color is gorgeous, though! It's accurate with the photo - a rich, jewel-toned green. It is long enough that one could wear it as a dress, alone, with some Spanx for safety underneath, but I plan to wear mine with leggings and boots. I tried it with a belt, and that looks cute, as well. The only problem I have with this dress goes back to all of the fabric, which is also what gives it its charm: I will absolutely have to wear some type of body shaper under this thing to avoid looking pregnant! If you are preggers, this is a dream maternity tunic! I so wish I could be pregnant again just for the clothes, lol (well, not just for the clothes). Alas, that train left the station with my last baby. But I digress. Shipping was actually very quick. This may be the fastest I've gotten anything from China, so props to this seller!

The strap is also easy to tie unlike some sandals I have had and had to struggle with the strap because it was too short and also so tight that by the end of the day my ankles would be hurting! Not so with these Lexi Sumac Wedge Sandals! The strap has plenty of length and easy on your ankles too! I do recommend them for easy and light weight wear.",Great Sandal and Light weight too!

positive,4.0,"I've had mediocre experience with Doc Marten's casual shoes.  I've previously bought others from DSW and direct from DrMartens USA web store, but the quality of their shoes has never been up to that of the standard issue boot (which carries the guarantee that the shoes do not).  Save the first pair of Doc leather shoes I had, EVERY other one has had some flaw emerge after a few months of regular use.  Seams and stitching wear out and start splitting.  Despite that I opted to try these, and so far, so good.  They're all leather outside, and somewhat stiff and uncomfortable at first.  I'd plan to wear them a few hours a day casually on the weekend before you take them for an all-day spin.  After a few days of (sucking it up at work) breaking them in, they're significantly better.  If you can get through a few days, they're not bad.  One thing to note: they don't have a lot of extra vertical clearance inside, as in for additional insoles/padding.  Many of my shoes bear additional gel inserts for comfort, but they would not fit comfortably in these, as they put too much pressure on the tops of my feet when laced securely, but once broken in, I've not been bothered with the standard beds.  I don't feel much arch support, but I have slightly flat feet, so less of an issue.","Better than most Doc shoes, long-term wear TBD."

positive,4.0,"Can you say cozy? I'm so glad I scored these at such an awesome price of 40 bucks. After last winter in Providence, I needed better boots. My expensive Keens did not keep my feet warm. (Granted they're a couple years old.) These are super comfy and warm. They don't have fabulous arch support like my Keens, just OK like a thick soled slipper. However, I can see myself being comfortable in these all day. I haven't tested them in cold or wet weather yet, but I wore them around the house and they warmed up my feet and legs quickly. I like the height and how they look with skinny pants/jeans/leggings. A little moon bootish without the clunky feel. They pull on easy and I think the draw string toggle at the top will come in handy when I take my boys sledding this year to keep the snow out.

Why 4 Stars Instead of 5:
I'm glad I paid attention to the reviews and ordered a size up. I'm a size 8 every day (except in athletic shoes 8.5), but with these I ordered a 9. They're not the least bit too big. Obviously, the sizing is off, but if you heed the warnings to size up, you'll be fine. I also find the toe box a little narrow, unlike my Keens.

positive,4.0,"I have at least 10 Baggallini bags. This is my favorite. I hate purses and was using a smaller one that I loved, but using my new eyeglasses + sunglasses wasn't working along with my large phone.  I had to go up a size and this is perfect because of the multiple storage areas.  Just prior to this purchase I bought another Baggallini that I thought would work but it seemed deeper and with less separate pockets so I was having to dig deep to find small items like lipstick in the main compartment. This has so many storage areas you can split things up with easy access. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the one I received seems to have a faulty magnet closure in the middle compartment.  I bought a very similar purse at TJ Maxx (exactly the same but gray and without the small front flapped area & the back magnetic closure area) & the middle magnets closed perfectly unless I opened them.  So I'm not sure if this was made wrong or because of the addition of those 2 small front & back storage areas causing more pulling (even without anything in those pockets). They do ""close"" but they open much more easily than the other similar purse I have.  I ordered this because TJ Maxx didn't have this in black.  I was afraid of the ""cheetah"" print but I love it - very subtle but nicer than just plain black.",My favorite Baggallini bag!
positive,4.0,"So far, I like this suit.  I don't love it.  There are a few bizarre things about the fit that I don't quite understand.  Other reviewers said that this fits small on top and large on the bottom.  That's perfect for my body type so I thought this would work.  I'm 5'6, 110lb, 34A.  I ordered a size small.  That was definitely the right choice...a medium would have been way too big.  But it still doesn't exactly fit right.

The top is really large around.  For a size small, a 34 is pretty standard.  This does have an adjustable back, but I have it adjusted to the smallest setting.  As you can see from the picture there are still a few extra inches of fabric, making this waaaaaay too loose to wear.  It's going to be an easy fix with a needle and thread, but you shouldn't need to do that with a new suit.  I'd say this is more like a 38.

The top is also....short for lack of a better word.  It rides up.  I'm not tall and not big, but the top keeps creeping up toward my neck.  Hopefully once I get the strap tighter this won't happen as much.

The bottom fits pretty well.  It's definitely short.  I'm a mom, and this is more of a ""wear on a weekend vacation with your husband"" swimsuit than a ""wear to the pool with the kids"" swimsuit.

This is a really cute suit if you're willing to work for it a little bit.  I can't imagine many people whom this would fit straight out of the box.  That being said, the suit appears to be good quality and it's really cute.  The blue color is vibrant just as it is in the pictures.","Cute suit, weird fit"

I can fit 2 water bottles inside the big compartment as well as fitting in a large wallet on one of the side compartments.  I did buy the Hedgren wallet & not sure I'm as happy with that as the purse but even that large item fits in this purse. I love that this purse has several compartments, all being held by a sturdy zipper with a very substantial pull tab. The tab is thick & durable, this is no cheaply  constructed item.  The strap can be adjusted but I've had no reason to do so as it fits so nicely as is.  I love this purse more than any other I've ever had.

My favorite pair of red wings are not made anymore, so again I hit the internet to find something I won't die in after working 12+ hours a day.

I wear a 12 B in red wings, and ordered the same in these Thorogoods. My first impression was they might be a little long, but definitely couldn't go down 1/2 a size. So I'd say they are fairly true to size. These are the first pair I've ordered that aren't steel toe, so I can't compare with my other boots since I can't check to see where my toe truly sits in my steel toes.

As far as the narrow width, I'd say it's spot on. If you have narrow feet you know that all boots look a little funky when laced tightly since the gap between the two halves is generally pretty close together. Unfortunately, that has not changed in these boots. Honestly I don't care what they look like, so long as they fit. Little bit snug around the pinky toe area and the widest part of my foot, but that is fine in new boots. They will stretch, and I'd rather they be a little snug, than too loose and blistery.

The soles and construction/stitching all seems to be very similar to what you'd expect from any other real mans work boot. My ariats, red wings, and now these, are all pretty similar. The color is ok I guess. Honestly I wish they made a black boot with a dark sole since I'm a mechanic. The red is going to be dark red and the white sole is going to be black over the next week anyway, so I guess I shouldn't complain.

I will continue to wear these and update this review down the road a bit when I've had a real chance to give them hell at the shop. So far I'd say if you're on the fence about laying down a days worth of pay on some red wings, you might want to order these and take the old lady out for some Big Macs instead. If you have narrow feet like me, these are a very highly recommended boot, and now I'm seeing why.

Update: After wearing these every other day (I alternate boots), these have broken in very well. Soles are of course no longer white, and the orange of the leather has darkened with daily exposure to oil. Theyve molded to my feet pretty well. The one thing I have noticed is that my right boot, on the outer edge of my foot just before the pinky toe, does rub where the edges of all the stitching meets. Isnt so bad it causes a blister, but when you wear them all day, it definitely turns my skin red and a bit sore. Not sure what the fix would be, but they're well broken in, so its either just a defect in this boot, or my right foot is weird. Never experienced this with any other boot brands, so Im guessing its the boot itself.

The soles are extremely comfortable and these boots are nice and light. I work easy 12 hrs a day, and these are still my favorites. Minus the one spot that rubs, I get home and my feet aren't tired. Concrete can do a number on you after a long day, but these boots sure help with that.",B width heaven!

positive,5.0,"Review of: ""Standard Unbreakable Umbrella U-115 Walking Stick W/Crooked Handle Self-Defense.""

Bottom line reviewer opinion:  Excellent umbrella which truly has amazing strength and durability that can be applied to self-defense against attackers and the elements.

There are already many thoughtful reviews in both written and video format so I won't digress into another one.  I simply wanted to let any prospective buyers know that this product is exactly what it claims to be.  As a martial arts practitioner I decided to work this product a little bit myself.  I practiced defense against standing striking bags and placed enough weight on it to break a traditional umbrella.  The results revealed no damage to the structure or material of the umbrella.  That is good enough for me.  The umbrella is sturdy with a strong end cap to use as a cane and of course opens to a very strong umbrella.  The rainstorms  under which I have employed it were also accompanied by strong gusts of wind.  The umbrella never wavered or collapsed.  Impressive indeed.  Five stars.",The Only Umbrella You Will Need

The back immediately broke down, which made it almost impossible to wiggle his foot in. That combined with just learning to tie his shoes on his own led to a lot of frustration. Luckily THESE shoes seem to be on par with what we would expect from New Balance- nice and sturdy.

positive,5.0,"I have a dress that I used when my daughter got married. Beautiful purple long dress that I decided to shorten to use for a relative's wedding at the end of this month. While browsing shoes and came across these and they are a PERFECT match and that's not an exaggeration. It has the same color, same jewels. I had hesitated purchasing them at first. I'm short and like to wear wedges but am disabled with a bad back so flats are better. Every time I got on I was concerned that the color might be just too good to be true until I noticed the price drop and couldn't resist ordering them. I'm so glad I got them. If I would've waited just a little longer I could have paid less but the price was still right. Before disability, I had very narrow, skinny feet but now my feet are wider and swell up. So they fit just a tad tight but the since the day I got them, I've been working on them to get a little wider so I know that will not be a problem. I also know I will probably use them with other purple outfits since regardless of the tightness, the step is still comfortable! I love Yellow Box shoes also. Have purchased sandals and love them. Now purchased a different kind of shoe and still love them. Absolutely, worth getting!",As expected!

positive,4.0,"This is your typical spandex black dress that can be worn at different times.  Dress it up or down and the front faux pockets will add something new that all your other black little numbers in your closet do not have.  The front pockets are not actual pockets.  Many are complaining that it is shapeless and I believe that it depends on the actual form that it lays on.  Being big chested, the pockets add a nice shape and it does cinch in a tiny bit.  The pocket flaps are not visible from the back.

The material is great because it should not need to be ironed if hung up.  It also washes easily in cold water.  My only gripe is that it is overpriced for what you are receiving.  It is comfortable and versatile but not for this price.  If I am being honest, it would be a great buy at fifty percent of the current cost.

Recommend if you like rayon/stretchy dresses that you can accessorize for different occassions.  At my suggested lower cost then this would be a dress that I could highly recommend to be a part of every woman's wardrobe.",Stretchy and flattering fit.

This is what Ive been looking for  a small stylish wallet / purse that I could use for quick errands that would easily hold my phone and other items and could easily fit into my glove compartment when I went to the gym or other places that I didn't want to bring a purse into.  This is not just a wallet to take on major trips (which I plan to do since it will hold all my travel document and other needs) but a wallet to use every day. I have lots of options of where to put items  including my phone.  And, I like having options of how to wear or carry the wallet  it comes with a detachable shoulder strap as well as a carry handle. The pictures next to the product description are accurate so I won't bother describing all the features  you can see them in the pictures.

It also doesn't make me too warm if I'm cooking in a hot kitchen. The collar comes up high around the neck, but is notched out in front so that's it's not restricting or unpleasant to wear. It has a convenient pocket on the sleeve to keep small chef's tools on hand yet out of the way. I use this pocket for my MP3 player.

positive,4.0,"I love these shoes!! They are so soft nd warm but not too warm that they make my feet sweat. My only complaint and the reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is bc they run pretty big. I normally wear a size 7.5-8 in womens. I have a average width foot. Maybe a tad bit wider than average but Ive never had to wear a size wide width shoe. I say this bc I bought this shoe in size 7 bc it was all they had in the color I wanted. I was hoping Id stretch them to fit. Well good thing I didn't buy bigger bc these definitely run big. As you can see from my pictures, they are a bit loose. I put some regular socks on with them and the fit is perfect but I hadnt intended to wear them with socks. Im definitely keeping them bc they were so cheap, are incredibly comfortable and really adorable.

positive,4.0,"This is a great open toe slingback.  The maple sugar color is a true nude, and works well with just about every summer outfit.  The black patent is a classic as well.

With respect to the fit of the shoe:
- The toe box is on the ""narrower"" side, but that's because your feet will naturally slide forward with a 3"" heel.  I personally did not have any issues with the ""narrowness"" of the toe box/strap, but people who wear this shoe with pantyhose might find their foot slipping forward a bit.
- The heel height is pretty comfortable. Like the other shoes in the Nike Air series, this shoe is padded and very comfortable to walk on.
- I found the shoe to be true to size with all of my other Cole Haan heels. No issues there.

The one criticism that I have for the shoe is that the holes for the ankle strap aren't in the best place for me. I seem to be between holes, so I may have a cobbler punch an extra hole for me (otherwise the ankle strap keeps slipping down when I walk).",Great slingback for the summer. Very comfortable.

positive,4.0,"Although it's slightly large to fit in a pocket, this makes a great anti-pickpocket wallet that comes in handy when traveling.

You attach one end to your belt (or an available belt loop, etc), and your walled becomes cabled to your body. Although I'm sure that a strong enough tug would pull it apart (although I doubt the steel cable would break!), it's much more secure than a conventional wallet.

Overall, the construction quality seems very good, and while it's not the most fashionable looking wallet you'll ever own, it does help you stay secure.

Definitely recommended for the price.",Great travel wallet

positive,5.0,These worked surprisingly well. I bought these in the winter because my legs were cold but I didn't feel like wearing full long johns under my pants so I got these. They kept my legs very warm and comfortable and I was impressed by the fact that they didn't slide down to my ankles like a lot of leg warmers do.

positive,5.0,"I have had these shoes for 5 years and they have been awesome (just checked my purchase date and I couldn't believe it)!  I regularly walk a few miles at a time on both sidewalks and dirt or gravel trails, and I'm amazed how well these have held up.  Lately, I've been walking 7 miles or more, and my feet are pretty sore after all that, but I attribute that to the cushioning breaking down after all these years. They were very comfortable for the first few years. They definitely don't look very old, although the fabric is starting to get slightly worn/ripped on a few edges (but you have to really look to notice it).  I've always had great quality from Merrell and these are no exception.  If I was still walking just 3 miles, these would be fine, and they would probably be fine for 7 if they were newer.",Amazing shoe

No issues with the soles, they are holding up and provide sufficient grip.

I think they look really slick on my feet, the look alone was a mental boost when playing. It' just a matter of - Look Good, Feel Good, Play Good. They are bright green with purplish/pinkish stripes.

positive,4.0,"So far, I really like this product.  I've been using it morning and night and my skin feels great!  I have extremely sensitive skin, so I am always wary when it comes to trying new products but I've had good success with this one.  There is not an over bearing scent to it, which is great.  There is a slight tint to the cream and it blends beautifully into my skin.  It doesn't lay on top either, it literally blends beautifully and then is absorbed without any greasy or caky after effect.

The applicator is really smooth and contoured to fit the eye very well.  It is designed to give you some circulation while you apply it which is TERRIFIC for puffy eyes.

Over all I am extremely pleased with the product, although I haven't noticed any significant changes under the eye with regard to my dark circles, I have noticed that my skin feels really good and I do like the brightening effect it has on my overall skin appearance.

I will continue using for a few more weeks and post any updates with regard to improvement.",Very nice product

I got this for my step daughter who is a size 18 usually a 1X but I bought the 2x in the shirt and it seems to still fit her a little snug but not as bad as it would have if I went true to size. She absolutely loves the little rhinestones across the front and the length is perfect for her short frame she's only 5'5 and its the perfect length. The fabric isn't heavy at all which is great for the summer heat. It isn't low cut like many other shirts yet is still feminine A++. Overall this is very well made adorable and great quality.

I went outside with this coat in that temp range from the lowest to the high 44 and this coat kept me warm the whole time with no issues.  The only issue I had was not getting a warm enough scarf or hat (so don't forget those).  What I love most about this coat is that its lightweight.  I can stuff it into my smaller backpack when getting on a flight. And I can even use this coat in California on our colder mornings.  This is now my new go-to coat...literally for all cold or cool weather.  I won't be wearing anymore of my bulky coats from this point forward.,Really does keep you warm in all cold weather and lightweight too!

positive,4.0,"After wearing my old pair of Sorel slippers down to threads over 10 years, it was time to replace them, so naturally I looked to Sorel again. These leather slippers appear to be even sturdier than the old felt ones, so I imagine they will last for at least 10 years. My only rather minor gripe is there is a bit of a lip to the back of the slipper - not low enough to ignore, but not high enough to keep the slipper holding firm to the heal as I walk. I can't really wear socks with these yet, but I imagine as the fleece compacts over time (as they always do), that issue will resolve itself.",Oh so cozy

The arm holes felt a little small for my upper arms - I don't know maybe I need to tone up or something. I liked the gold zipper on the back a lot - totally made the dress look nice.

Was very presently surprised and loved how the ring looks and feels . the etching was very good but one major complaint was it is hard to read.
an easy trick is a permanent black marker like sharpie. cover the ring surface with it then  wipe it off. if you like it darker do it again.

did this trick on one of my rings and it looks awesome. after i even cleaned it with a bit of soap and water to make sure nothing comes off and it still stays in the etching",There can only be one ... and now for you

positive,5.0,"This is a pink lotion in a gorgeous glass bottle, and it has the most wonderful fragrance.  Even the pink box the bottle comes in is gorgeous.

This is a pump bottle, and pressing the button on top squirts out a stream of the heavenly lotion.  You can aim it to get the lotion exactly where you want it, since the stream is thin and the lotion comes out with pinpoint accuracy.

Now to describe this light, subtle fragrance.  The jasmine is the first topnote to meet my nostrils.  And everyone loves jasmine.  A white rose is the next note. I would have chosen water hyacinth as the middle note, although this mentions sandlewood (which would be a bassnote) and lemon for the middle note. And yes, the lemon is there, but I had to search for it, which is for me unfortunate as it is the most favorable note in fragrances for my body chemistry.

There is also something of water, clean laundry, sunshine, with rainclouds on the horizon.  The lemon peeks out in the dry down.  The initial happy aroma quickly dies down into a skin scent.  What is left is a silky, watery moisture drenching my thirsty skin, and I keep putting my arm to my nose to inhale the soft, delicate sunny scent.  And I love the artistic, subliminally phallic bottle.  It's not only gorgeous, it's suggestive, especially with the unsubtle word ""BODY"" on it.

This is all what a top of the line body lotion with scent should be.  The pretty box, the glamorous and unique bottle it houses, the delicious moisturization without grease, oil, or heaviness, combined with the elegant high quality, nature-inspired fragrance that lingers in the background on my skin, all speak volumes about the seriously decadent attitude Burberry takes toward its line of perfumes and lotions.  Burberry means quality, and is an English version of the House of Chanel in many ways.",Delicious light scent in a lotion

The Bender hat is soft, comfortable (albeit a little lumpy), and serves its hilarious purpose. The antenna bit IS pretty long, but it isn't a problem. Overall, a really fun thing to pull over your head! Worth the purchase, I can tell you.

The only possible drawback (and its kind of a stretch) is that it looks like you killed Bender and decided to wear his ""skin"" over your head, like some kind of battle trophy. It might be the emptiness in the stunned expression of Bender's bulging eyes. This applies doubly for the Nibbler hat.",Savage Battle Trophy for the Ages

The fabric is Polyester, so it breathes well and is much silkier than cotton. The fit and color are very close to the product image here on Amazon and the size is accurate.

He's on his second pair now (he wore the first ones until they literally fell apart. Which was a long time. Definitely got our money's worth! Anyway, the new pair doesn't smell bad.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

My husband loves these. I do not. Because they smell TERRIBLE. Seriously.

Thankfully, the smell fades over time, but initially, every time he wore them I thought something in the house was on fire. Or that the dog needed a bath. Or SOMETHING. Weird, unpleasant sheep-y smell? Not pleasant at all.

But my husband didn't mind it, and since he's the one wearing them, I can't really complain. But it's worth a mention, because it's a very strong smell.

He wears a 10.5 shoe and we ordered an 11. Fit fine with socks.

We used to buy similar slippers from the exclusive retailer in Maine (you know the one -- monogrammed tote bags and backpacks, etc.), but they wouldn't even last a whole year, and cost a fortune.

These are not cheap, but they last a LONG time, because of the rubber soles. They're worth the money.

They're by far my husband's favorite slippers, so I probably should've given them 5 stars, but honestly, that smell is bad. And it's not his feet that stink. It's the shoes.",Great Slippers -- Half Sizes Order Up -- Beware the Smell

positive,4.0,"The reason I gave this 4 stars is because the title could be misleading for some. They are NOT jeans. They are navy blue sweat pants that are sewn together with gold/yellow stitching to appear like jeans. There is no hint of denim whatsoever. WITH THAT BEING SAID ... They are perfect for me because I'm all about comfort. For the past 20++ years of dressing up to go to work every single day I've reached a point in my life where I just want to be comfortable and these pants are exactly what I need. They look super cute with a Tee or Tank Top and sneakers or Flip Flops. I also own 2 pair of Pajama Jeans but I wanted to try these because of the price. The difference :
Pajama Jeans are more expensive. They are made of a thicker material, heavier and do have a more denim jean appearance including detail on the pockets (rivets) . Also they are a tad bit shorter in length. The length of both of these pants (Comfy and Pajama Jeans) are so great because I don't have to have them hemmed. I'm not sure how the length would be on you if you're over 5'5.  I'm 5'4 about 150lbs and I wear a medium in these comfy jeans and they fit perfect with a little room. I do NOT put them in the dryer. I line dry because I don't want the length to shrink.  I own both Large and Medium in the Pajama Jeans (I wear the large ones around the house). In all honesty The Comfy Jeans Pajama Style pants are my favorite. They are more light weight ( I'm a hot natured person ) They fit better and feel better. I wear them everywhere. I'm done with expensive uncomfy regular jeans that are too long , too short, show crack, stretch out after an hour of wearing them , dig in , ride up etc etc !!! I used to joke about these pajama type pants until I got a pair. LOL I'm never going back.

*** UPDATE ***  After several washes they started to get fuzzy with little beads on them so now I can only wear them around the house : (  I only wash them with jeans so I wasn't expecting that to happen. I'm very careful in washing all my clothes. I line dry as well.  Oh well.  The Pajama Jean brand doesn't do that. They are still going strong after everyday wear and weekly washing. So the real PAJAMA JEANS are the winner !!!",Perfect for me !

I wore a ring over these gloves, it did not harm them at all, if these ever wore out I would re buy another pair. I added a picture from one of the ren fairs(Michigan Ren Fair).

positive,4.0,"Pros: This boot is very nice and well made. The leather is buttery soft and looks nice with both dress up and dress down attire. The foot bed is quite comfortable and I can stand in them all day while teaching with minimal to no discomfort. My feet don't get overheated or sweaty in these boots compared to pleather varieties. I enjoy having dry socks at the end of the day.

Cons: The boot runs small and narrow. I have narrow feet and the boot feels tight on them. I also had trouble zipping the shaft over my 15 inch calf at first. There is an expansion area, but the design would have benefited from a 1-2 inch deeper v to allow the shaft to expand properly around the leg.

The boots have stretched out a little over several days of wear. I am hoping they will continue to mold to my feet. They feel more comfortable each day I wear them, but the seem to require a long breaking in period.

Overall: Depending on how the boot adapts to my feet and calves over time, I would consider purchasing this boot again. I am extremely happy with the comfort. It is difficult for me to find shoes that allow me to stand for long periods.",Need a Breaking-In Period

The lace on the top has held together really well after four or five times of washing which I was really pleased with. My preschooler has very sensitive skin, and it is very soft on the inside.

positive,5.0,I had two pair of these earrings. I sent one back because the posts were sort of like a screw back with metal holders so you had to almost screw them in. When you pulled them off the ball came off its post so I kept the one pair that was more secure and sent the broken ones back. Well I kept going back to look at them on Amazon because I really liked the one pair I had so I went for it again because of the sale price and ordered two more pairs. They have new plastic or rubber backings - like little diaphragms - that you puncture the post through so no more screwing. I love these earrrings. I have kept one in my upper ear for almost six months with no problem. Now I have two more pair. Very happy with the purchase - especially the price. If Amazon still has them snatch them up fast!

The top is just slightly tight in the bust with extreme movement, but with everyday working their is no problem, so I'm glad I got one size smaller than I normally would.  There is TONS of room for my growing belly and everywhere else.

The only thing I would change about this scrub top is the pockets.  They are not the same on both sides.  The right side has the standard small and large square pockets.  On the left is one large angled pocket.  It's not bad, just not what I'm used to.

I am so happy I bought these scrubs (I got the matching scrub pants and equally love them)!  I would recommend them to anyone that needs them.",So Comfortable!

positive,5.0,"Fanmis Womens Watch with a Rose Gold Case and Brown Leather Strap Watch is a stunner. I love rose gold, and the white face with the handsome brown leather strap sets it off wonderfully. The quality is excellent: the watch was running when it arrived. I immediately tried it on. The  watch face has black roman numerals. However the hour hand, minute hand and second hand are blue, which looks great with the faux sapphire cabochon on the side, where you set the watch.
It is a very retro looking watch, which is highly fashionable at the moment. I don't see this fashion going away any time soon, and in the fall this watch will look smashing with all your new outfits! I think Fammis has a real hit here with this lovely ladies watch. What a wonderful gift, as well, for your friends! Gorgeous watch!

I received this watch in return for my honest, unbiased review, but the opinions are wholly my own.",Fammis' Beautiful Retro Watch for Ladies!
positive,4.0,"This dress is beautiful and well made however the fit could be better . My figure is small on top and bigger in the bottom. I normally wear a size 8/10.

positive,5.0,"I LOVE this little dainty, sweet ring!!! I saw it and had to have it. I bought it in a size 4 for my pinky finger to wear on my right hand, but I could have probably gotten away with wearing a size three! I am 44 years old and have extremely slim fingers. The silver is very durable and I have had no issues with the ring bending with the warmth of my hand, for I never take this ring off. The ring is very solid as far as the band is concerned even though it is constructed of two pieces of (sturdy) silver wire loops. I have had no tarnishing issues either. The little pink crystals are very bright, and the center ""diamond"" like crystal really sparkle considering how tiny they are in size. I believe it would make a lovely first ""big girl's"" ring to give to a young girl as a birthday or first communion gift...I have received many compliments on it already, as to how pretty it is and it is very reasonably priced. I am going buy two more as Christmas gifts for my two little nieces ages 6 and 5 so they can match their Auntie & have something special to bond us together.",I LOVE MY Sterling Silver Pink Flower Ring!!!

positive,4.0,"Very cute top! I read the other review which says that it buckles out at the armpit area and thought that I could just take it in myself. Upon arrival, I noticed there were two strings in the back that needed to be crossed and inserted into the sides of the armpit area. Once I did this and tightened it, it no longer buckled.

I am usually a size extra small with a D cup, so this was a bit loose on me. That is why I said it fits ""as expected"". That being said, if you have a small frame, it will be a little loose on you. As well, if you have a small bust, it may be too big.

The lace is adorable and my only complaint for this product is in the middle of the chest. It looks like they cut part of the lace.. You can look at the picture and see this. It's pretty unnoticeable though.

I will be bringing this in just a tad in order to fit my small frame. But other than that, I'm excited to wear this on my vacation next month!",Very cute crop but runs big
positive,5.0,I've had other stretchers that had wooden shoe pieces but some internal parts were plastic and in time they broke. This one has all metal internal parts and the wood is beautifully finished. Also it works very well. I haven't had it long enough to see how it holds up but it seems very sturdy. The handle is easy to turn. Would definitely recommend.,Impressive machine
positive,4.0,"Really nice dress, color was the same as the picture and the cut was to be expected as well. The fabric was thick and a great quality, especially for the price, very pleased with the quality of the dress itself. Great dress for a fall/winter event...in this case a wedding. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because of a few things:
1. Heavy fabric is great,  but it causes the skirt to pull the waistline down constantly (supposed to be empire waist) I had to keep pulling it up all day, could be fixed with a nice belt but I didn't have time to get one for this occasion.
2. The top is cut VERY low. I had to keep the girls from spilling out, two-sided tape or a cute cami underneath would have fixed this but again, didn't have time to shop for those items this time.
3. It made me look pregnant. This dress would be AMAZING as a maternity dress, if your bigger around the waistline like me, it will make that stand out, especially from a side view. It actually will make you look bigger in the midsection than you actually are unfortunately.
4. The sizing is a bit large,  I bought an XL, I'm 5'6 about 210 pounds and I liked it being lose, but could have worn a large comfortably.
Other than that, I wore the dress all day, with wedge shoes and with flats and I was pleased with the length, I got lots of compliments.  Overall, really great dress for under  $50",Great dress...with some notes.

positive,5.0,"My daughter loves her new backpack. She is 9 years old and this fit her well. She likes how the lunch bag can attach to the backpack in the front, if you want it to. I added a picture of how it looks attached to the front. The size of the backpack can fit her books and notebooks just fine.

Pros:
Full Size, not toddler size, so it will last longer.
The lunch bag can attach to the front of the bag, no more smashed sandwiches.

I wish they were wrinkle free but if you put them in the dryer on a medium heat for about 5 minutes it will take most out.  I love the pockets and a place to stash little things.  Word of warning however, these run large in my opinion.  I really think I could have used a medium whereas I wear mainly large in most shirts.

So it you want a lightweight and UV protection shirt in great bright colors then this would be a great pick for you.  These also wear well tucked in if you wish.  Forgot to mention the collars are velcro so you don't have that small hard to manipulate button like most shirts that have button down collars.

I bought it as a gift and that is my opinion.  If you are looking to buy it for yourself to keep a ring it is worth it as well.  I plan on buying one for every nice ring that I give loved ones, I definitely found a winner here, its well worth the price you won't be disappointed.","Very Elegant, Big Nice and Shiny"

positive,5.0,I got these for my other half. I wanted something they could go in the swimming pool or beach water with. We have been planning a vacation for months now and these arrived just in time. I would suggest ordering a half size up as they are water shoes and are meant to be a bit snug. They work great in water and do not weight you down. They let your feet breathe and not sweat as you walk around the pool or beach. Perfect for what we needed. I received a free product to review. I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way.,Poolside

positive,5.0,"I've had these for the better part of 2 months now, and am completely pleased with the purchase. They look good, are very well made, and the non-slip soles really do the job!

They felt a little tight across the toe at first (which was surprising as I ordered the wide size) but after a couple of days breaking in, they were completely comfortable. The best part is that while the insoles offer great arch support, they're also 100% removable, so you can put in your own insoles (Dr. Schole's, etc) if you feel so inclined, so you can get exactly the level of comfort you want/need.

After a few weeks of the damp Seattle weather, I did notice an annoying constant squeak from the heel of first my left, then both shoes.  I was incredibly dismayed, because as much as I loved these shoes, it was incredibly annoying. However, a trip to visit my in-laws in Arizona inadvertently fixed the problem/showed me how to avoid it. Being 80+ degrees and in a dry climate, I chose to wear sandals my entire trip there. When we got back home, I realized the squeak was gone! After a few days in rainy weather, I noticed the squeak gradually returning. Surmising that the reason it went away was because the dry Arizona air got rid of some moisture that worked its way inside the shoe, I took the insoles out and left my shoes next to the heating duct for the night. The next day, the squeak was gone! I've taken to lifting the heel of the insole out of the shoes at night to allow them to breathe and prevent holding moisture in, and haven't had a single issue with squeaking since.

Please note, you probably WON'T encounter this issue unless you're in an area with a lot of cool, damp weather (like Seattle). And even if you do, it's an easy fix if you encounter the squeaking issue I described. With how easy it was to remedy, I certainly didn't feel like it was enough to knock this below 5 stars. Totally satisfied with these.",Totally comfortable!

positive,5.0,Awesomec,Comfortable
positive,5.0,"These boots ARE true to size... I'm a 7 in everything and the occasional 6.5. I was a little suspicious of the other reviews suggesting going up a full size, or a size and half up. That's quite the difference. I already own some Keen hiking shoes that are 6.5, and while they fit, they felt a little tight in the toes if I wore wool socks. I based my sizing off that and got these boots in a 7. Dude, the 7 fits perfect. If you FOR SURE know your TRUE size, get that size.

These boots are comfortable right out of the box! I immediately wore them dog walking down muddy dirt roads and trails for a couple miles and they were great. I like them a lot. They're comfortable, they fit great, and I really like the colors. Good ankle support. They seem like they're quality boots as well. American made, baby.

I have a backpacking trip coming up and will update my review after. For now, I'll keep using these dog walking and hiking the local trails to break them in.

UPDATE----

I just got back from a 28 mile backpacking trip in the Grand Gulch Primitive Area in Utah. These boots KICKED BUTT! I wore appropriate wool hiking socks with them and never had issues with my feet. I had hot spots on the outside of my big toes (both big toes) and that was it. I taped them off and was good to go the rest of the trip. Meanwhile, everyone else in my group with different boots were taping practically their entire feet.

The soles are very grippy, I was the only one in my group that wasn't struggling to get a good foot hold on the steeper parts. We also climbed some sandstone and slickrock, these boots gripped just fine. There was one point in my trip where I had to shimmy through a small hole and along the edge of a canyon wall to reach some ruins and I felt like I could trust these boots with my life, they wouldn't let me slip down the wall. Overall, I am very, very happy with these comfortable, grippy boots and will continue to buy Keens in the future.",These ARE true to size

I ordered the 9 for these & my feet slip around a bit- would require thick socks & they still feel like they'll break in quite a bit.

positive,5.0,"I obtained Obagi Foaming Gel at the same time as Obagi Nu-Dern Toner and  Serum and began to use them all at once and at the same time.  I saw incredible results after one use and this has continued since then.  My face looks years younger, cleaner and better toned.

No, this is not a paid commercial.  I am a no-nonsense New Yorker, beholding to only the truth.

The foaming gel cleanses quickly, thoroughly.  It has a pleasant aroma and you only need to use a little at a time.  The toner is not very strong.  The fact that no dirt comes off is a tribute to the foaming gel.  Other toners I have used are really astringents and feel like they have stripped your face of its natural oils.
The serum goes on easily and quickly.  I place a few drops in the cup of my hand and put it on my face.  Honestly, I don't know what it does, but my face is smoother, with no pores showing.  My makeup goes on more easily and stays on longer.

These products are not cheap, but I feel like I look five years younger, and my friends have noticed a difference.  Despite the cost, I believe I will purchase them when I have finished

positive,4.0,"I like this shoe. I believe I would love this shoe if my arch was deeper. My feet are somewhat flat, so I knew there would be a chance it wouldn't quite work out, but I tried anyway because I need a great dance fitness shoe and it came with pretty good reviews.
What I like about it: It seemed to be true to size, but I think I can see how people say it's a little roomy. I wear a size 9, but I still don't think an 8.5 would have been a smart move, personally. It was comfortable for a while. The only thing that began to be uncomfortable was the arch, b/c I just chose the wrong shoe. It worked very well with my turns and transitions while dancing.
What I didn't like: It slid a little when it was time to stretch and didn't provide the ankle support I was looking for in a high top. It may have worked if I'd pulled the velcro part really tight, but that just wouldn't look right.
Overall, it was ok. Just wish I could find the same type of performance in a shoe that doesn't have a split sole, one that caters to my flat feet.","Great shoe, just not for flat feet"

I was looking for something lightweight because I don't want thick/heavy fabric in the summer. These are light, a good length, and fit as expected. I typically wear either Medium or Large tops depending on the fit, so I ordered each size for comparison. The medium fit nice and snug, and the large was a little looser, but I kept the Large in case it shrinks when washing.

I purposely got a size or so too large for later use, and so they do seem to be true to size based on the fact that they definitely don't fit her yet! The fabric is a very nice, hearty yet lightweight cotton, and the screen printing/design aspect is really well-done. The tee-shirt and shorts combo will be perfect to keep her cool on warm nights, but I would go so far as to say that she could easily wear this outfit out in public and nobody would realize it was pajamas, because it's a such a hearty, quality fabric and design. In fact, I like the design so much we will probably do that! I have yet to run this set through the washer and dryer, but I don't expect any issues based on the quality of the fabric. I can't wait for her to grow into this set; she's going to look so adorable!!!! (Please note that I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

However, I am not confident that this will be as comfortable of a fit for someone who wears a true 4x.

size chart on the coat reads:

XXS: 4/5  (I found this would be big on a 4 year old. Fits a ""normal sized"" 5 year old with some room to grow a bit.
XS: 6/7
S: 8
M: 10/12
L: 14/16
XL: 18/20

I wear a 7.5 and have wide feet so I bought an 8 and they are perfect with or without socks.  With the fleecy insides it feels like they are surrounding your feet and legs with cushioning.  I used a heavy duty silicone water repellant on them (only one coating because I bought them one day and used them the next) and they stayed dry in over 12 inches of snow (this was the most expensive brand of water repellent they had).  With socks and pants tucked in they are snug enough with the fleece that snow does not get down inside of the boot.  They stayed totally dry on a recent trip to the mountains with trudging through snow drifts well over the boot top and my feet were warm and dry the entire time.

positive,5.0,"As a business person that regularly wears ties, I can assure you this is not a fine silk tie. If that's what you're expecting than you shouldn't purchase this product.

On the other hand, in a novelty occasion (seasonal for example) this tie is of exceptional quality! I would compare its quality to typical ties found in department stores that price around $15-35. The material does not look or feel cheap, and the red color is vivid and catches the eye (like most red ties are designed to do). The small christmas trees are subtle, yet well detailed on the tie. This does not scream ""cheesy"", but rather presents a festive look around the holidays.

The width and length of the tie are fairly standard and compare well with most of the ties I normally purchase (There is a ""skinny"" version available, but this is more traditional for my body type - 6'0"" - 175lbs).

This sleeper is like having an old friend you can just be casual with! It is lightweight, as I wanted, and very soft brushed cotton. The cute comment on the front is soft lettering, not stiff al all, and there is a touch of gold outline on the lettering- this is just darling all around! It does have a real button-up front, but it's more a style, I was easily able to pop it over my head to put it on.

Im planning on using them while on the boat and I think they will be absolutely perfect for:  driving the truck to the ramp, walking on a wet dock or boat and walking along the beach.

Since they are all mesh they should dry very rapidly.

positive,5.0,"I own several sets of clipon sunshades. I like this pair the best. I am especially impressed with the build quality and the design of the clips themselves - the springy bits that attach the shades to the glasses themselves. They inspire confidence, both in the firmness of their grip and the gentleness of the protective padding that actually contacts the lens.

They are also light. I have another pair with carefully designed clips, but they are heavy and leave a rather noticeable and painful crease on the bridge of one's nose after several hours of use. These clipons, by contrast are light and I hardly notice I am wearing them.

Also, when you flip the shades up away from the lenses, they click firmly into place at solid right angle.

I would highly recommend these.","conspicuously well-designed, sturdy, comfortable to wear"

positive,5.0,"These shoes are perfect for ""running around"" in summer, fall too  - the leather and sole are super-soft and comfortable.  Because the leather is so soft the need no break-in time; they are almost like gloves for your feet.  Because the sole is springy-soft, they are comfortable to wear even if you have foot problems.  The purple color is especially fun, many people have commented on how cute they are.  I believe they are a bit on the wider size - just a little bit - for ecco slip-on shoes ... they fit me fine even though I often choose wide-width shoes.  However, this might be because the uppers are so flexible, they will accommodate a little  wider foot.  The size length-wise seems to be just about right.

positive,5.0,"I am a repeated customer and have repeatedly bought this product. It is very well make. The cut is good and the pouch is well... ""flattering"". The material is very sound and smooth to touch. I love this. This is a top quality product that is priced very well. You get 4 of these for what you would normally have to pay for just 1 trunk of this quality. I highly recommend this product.",The cut is good and the pouch is well
positive,5.0,These are super cute and they have just the prettiest pink soles that pop against the rubber upper. The upper part is a sort of whitish gray color that reminds me of an overcast sky. Add the pink flowers and it's just like spring time in shoe form. But my absolute favorite thing about them is the fabulous box that they come in it's the prettiest yellow flowered girly suprise bonus that I will be keeping random stuff inside of for probably forever ever.,Brightens up my rainy days

positive,5.0,"I love the look of the opal's fire with the amethyst. It's very sparkling and eye-catching.

The band is thick, nicely so and sturdy, so I don't think I'll need to worry about the ring bending out of shape with wear.

The opal on mine is slightly off center vertically, but only by a fraction of a millimeter, so it's unnoticeable unless you're staring at the ring for more than a few seconds. I don't consider it a drawback, really. It's a $15 ring, I wasn't expecting complete perfection.

Overall, I'm quite happy with this ring.","Not absolutely perfect, but quite nice for the price"
positive,5.0,I absoulelt loved this sandal the only problem I had was the color it is a cherry wood .I thought it was brown or light brown I ended up giving it away because I could not match it with anything.

positive,4.0,"Overall I like this purse and it's quite attractive.  On the plus side, it's a nice size, the color I ordered (pink) is true to the color on the screen, the lining is a light color making it easier to locate whatever, and the handle is wide so it doesn't slip off the shoulder.  Also the outside pocket fits my iPhone 6s which is a must for me.  On the negative side, the hardware is unnecessarily too heavy and I don't like interior center pockets.  Overall the positives outweigh the negatives making this purse well worth the reasonable price.",Positives more than negatives

positive,5.0,"LOVE them!  Super cute on, color as expected.  They do run a teensy bit large; I usually wear a size 7.5 but, based on the reviews, I went with a 7.  I'm glad I did, but they fit exactly and there is no room at all.  My toes don't hang off the edge, but they are close!  I would definitely recommend these wedges.  I've only worn them once and they do become a bit uncomfortable after a while.  I've spent quite a bit of time trying to find the perfect wedge and I think I found it!",Great Wedge!
positive,5.0,"This suit exceeded my expectations, because some of the negative reviews worried me. First of all, the pink is a beautiful hot pink leaning slightly toward magenta. The fit is good, maybe a bit loose; I could've possibly gone one size down. For reference (and because reading people's measurements/sizing helped me), I am 5'9"" and 165 lbs with a rather full butt & hip area but only a 36B bust size. Because of this, with swimsuits, I would normally wear a M on top and a M or L on bottom. Pant size is usually around 8, give or take, and I usually wear a S or M on top. This suit fits well on both top and bottom, and the style is very flattering and slimming. I highly recommend it and I'm even considering buying another one in a different color!",Flattering and sexy monokini

It runs about 2 sizes smaller than normal, and is really as small fitting Medium! The lace on the shirt was a slightly more off-white than the blouse.

positive,5.0,"Some time ago, I bought an amethyst pendant from Amazon to go with a pair of earrings I received as a gift. The pendant's stone was a lot darker than my earrings which are probably more of a Rose de France color. I wore them together and was disappointed that they didn't match better. Then I saw that these earrings from Amazon seemed to have the same style of setting as the pendant, but from the online picture, the stones seemed much darker than the pendant stone.  The price was very good so I took a chance and ordered them. The earrings are a perfect color match to the pendant.  I am very pleased!",Perfect match!

positive,5.0,"It's so hard to find one piece suits for my long torso girls. I do purchase them 2 sizes larger to get a perfect fit. This suit covers them in the front, stays out of their bums, has no strings to fiddle with, and holds it's shape and appearance through continuous wear all summer. My children spend so much time in the pool that they tend to eat, sleep, wear the suits under their clothes, and jump on the trampoline before jumping back in the pool. For the last 2 years I have purchased each of them 2 suits and at the end of the summer the suits are still nice. This cut is also available in several different colors and patterns so they are always excited to get something completely new and different. One con; the suits have enough fabric to cover, but not really enough support to handle developing busts in older girls. I'm sad that this summer I will have to search for something different for my oldest daughter.",My long torso girls love these 2 sizes larger.

positive,4.0,"Have been on the hunt for a an octagonal two tone watch with either tick marks or roman numerals, and a champaign dial.  This is pretty close, and I am happy with the quality.  I like the idea of never needing to replace the battery.  The bracelet is generously sized; most will need to remove a few links. (You don't need a special tool, just a paper clip and needle nosed pliers: push the pins down in the direction of the arrows against a layer of cloth or tissue.  The pins will pop right out.)

I took off one star for the goofy half-second tick marks on the face of the watch, though.  What earthly use is a half-second tick mark on an analog watch with an indexed second-hand that mechanically CAN'T stop between full seconds?  It's just visual clutter, and makes the dial look like it is ringed with stubble.  It's a really unfortunate effect since the watch otherwise looks elegant.  However, there aren't so many two tone watches with dodecagons (and I failed to find an octagon)  around the dial.  They look very classy and people comment on the shape. I like the look of the rest of the watch well enough to keep it and am training my eyes to ignore the 120 tick marks around the edge of the dial.  Overall, a nice watch.",Nice watch
