These earrings are way too small to be visible. I was disappointed and sent them back.
Comes with only one clear strap. Total waste of money as its so uncomfortable its not even worth buying clear straps for.
"Great concept, but very wide opening at the ankle.  It made my ankles look like bird legs in wellies rain boots.  I had high hopes for these but will continue the search."
Hat is too small for my 8 year old head. The belt ring already fell off after one wear. Does not come with baton nor the handcuff. Have a feeling I'm going to have to get something new for next Halloween. Pretty expensive custom for one time use.
Cute but Way too big
I love the shoes and they fit great but I'm not sure I can keep them. One came with the laces tied like it should be on the end but the right shoe isn't. I'm trying to not it like the left one but it's not working. Bummed to say the least
"It was so scratchy feeling, there was no way I could have worn it for long so it went back!"
Terrible quality. Smells discusting
"You think the shoe is going to be comfortable, but there is not enough lift in the toe area for the height of the heel.  the toe area needs a bit of a platform. this shoe is not comfortable at all I am very disappointed.  if I could give it 0 stars I would"
"meh, wouldnt buy again."
They were really cute but they would not stay in place.  I had to keep pulling them up and found myself readjusting all night.
"Man, I wanted to really love these shoes. I admired them for months before finally deciding to treat myself to a pair for my birthday. I made a mistake of not really delving into the reviews until after I had placed the order and almost thought about canceling it before they shipped. I did make assumptions about the materials based on the photo (like lots of other reviewers) thinking this was some kind of cute maybe faux leather (at least, surely for that price?) but when I read it was screen printed canvas, I too was disappointed. I decided to give them a try anyway, since after all, there are tons of positive reviews and maybe I would still love them?  They arrived right on time, in a cute (but strange) milk carton type box thing that is sealed with two plastic grommets at the top. The grommets fly everywhere when you open it, so be careful! My dog of course thought they were treats and tried to gobble them up. The shoes themselves, are cute-ish. I am a huge fan of the Mary Jane/baby doll style because I have super wide feet (thanks Scandinavian genetics). I figured this was a slam dunk!  I *did* measure my feet, as instructed prior to ordering and these should have fit...I wear normally a size 8 to 8.5 due to the wideness. I bought an 8 and they were waaaay too big, not only in length but way too roomy which in itself takes an act of God with my feet. I tromped around for a bit, but they just looked weird and floppy. The toes sort of caved in even with socks which kind of killed the cute baby doll look for me. The uppers are indeed made of a stiff canvas. It's not a particularly nice or thick canvas either. It's thin and rigid and I had nightmare flashbacks of those awful Sunday school shoes my mom used to make me wear that would rip my heels all to hell. It does look like they would be easy to clean however. For those who say that they aren't a true black, the ones I got are, so I think they may have corrected their coloring for these.
The sole seems to be good quality though but it's all basically glued together. This is 100% not a shoe worth $70, despite the adorable designs they come in-- I think the company is grossly over estimating the cute collect-ability value vs. the quality of the shoe. As others have stated, this shoe should be closer to $30, no more."
I am keeping it but just barely. It doesn't side smooth and the straps don't stay up very well. Since that it an ongoing issue with me and my body I'm dealing with it but that's about it.
Overpriced.  Dont seem much better than other similar socks to be honest
"Like most clothes you buy today, the size is a bit small"
Great belt. Great fit and look for work. (casual). (Revised) Wore a few times and the belt metal part bent with normal use. Not sure how it happened. I had to fix with pliers.
"Its a shame or strange  this happens in this brand..... for some reason the just the brand stripe feel to tight, really don't now how to explain"
I am 5'5 and 150 I bought a large. It seemed too big also the fabric thin and straps looked like they would break the first time I wore it. Sending back.
These are the most uncomfortable shoes I've ever purchased. My feet were begging me to take them off.
"This ""dress"" is ridiculous. First, it's not a dress, you can't wear it in public, unless you wear it at the beach, over your swimwear. You can't wear it in your house, when you have family around, because is thin, you can see the underwear very clearly. It's that kind of material that it tends to smell when you sweat in the summer. I can't imagine sleeping with it neither, yuck.
They took their time to put notes at the description that colors may differ from the pics, but they didn't explain what material this thing is made of, and they should change the name from ""dress"" to ""beach dress"".
As far as the sizing, I wear Medium and ordered Large, but is too loose for me.
Don't buy, I just threw $10 away."
"I liked them, but my daughter didn't. They were difficult to put on and fit more like a 5 than a 5.5."
"Bought for a star wars REY costume. Worked great for 2 days.
Pilled up after 2 days, so I won't be wearing them out of the house."
Was torn and no way this fits any woman's chest!
Returned.  Didn't stand and wasn't sturdy.
"Even though I only got this as part of a Halloween costume... it is highly disappointing.  It is surprisingly cheap, even for $15.  As mentioned in other reviews, it's flimsy... the leather straps are horribly made.  The one I got is attached off center and crooked.  The shoulder strap needs another buckle thing to hold the excess in place.

Hopefully no one buys this to use as an actual bag... because it really is horribly made.  Lots of threads breaking loose and in places it's not even correctly sewed.  I can only imagine it was hand made by some slave labor child worker in India as no machine could screw up stitching this badly. If you are looking for an actual bag to use, don't buy this one, look at some of the other bags and read the reviews (something I did not do until now)  Since I bought this as a costume prop, then I don't mind so bad.  If I bought it for regular use, I would absolutely return it."
Love the style but they shoe was way to big in the front.
very cheap quality. not worth it
"I ordered 2 rings, I received 2 different rings. One was smooth all the way around, comfortable and perfect. The other one had a very sharp edge that actually cut me when I put it on.
I contacted the seller and they said they would be happy to give me a refund once I pay to ship it back, basically paying the same amount the ring cost. So either way I am out, so I might as well keep the useless ring.
Not worth it."
Good for the beach. Only pair of Skechers I have not loved. Will use them around the pool or at the beach.
"For $9.95, I really wasn't expecting very much, but unfortunately this fanny pack is much lower quality than it appears in the picture. It reminds me of those cheap, clear plastic backpacks made for kids. Worse, it smells weird -- sort of like sardines dunked in chemicals. I left it by an open window for a couple days and the odor hasn't faded. The pack is also bigger and bulkier than expected.

I'm sure this would make a great gift for a kid and it would be a perfect accessory for an 80's costume, but it's not what I was hoping for. Returning."
"Shirt is very thin, I do not think it will survive multiple washes. Also it smells kind of funky. Very nice that necklace was sent with the top, but the necklace is cheap as well."
Ive had 3 Luminox watches and they all have quit running within 3 years. They don't last and yes that is with new batteries.
"These simply do not work. The laces will not fit in the end lock piece no matter what you do. I used very sharp hairdresser scissors so ends would not fray and it still did not fit in there. The end piece does not lock together, even when empty. I ended up just tying them but that is not what I wanted. I had tie shoestrings. I am so sorry I bought 4 of these. I thought I could switch out colors, not possible anyway. Hubby had to superglue the ends as they fray like crazy. Bad purchase, not what I was expecting"
Tarnished and can not clean it! :(
gave it to landscaper-he like it I didn't
"I have ordered and worn 2(x)ist men's briefs for years The quality and construction has declined.. This latest item has reduced the material in the construction, so it barely fits. Not pleased, as I ordered and laundered 9 pair."
Nice-looking gloves but I can't use them as a driving glove because the palm surface is too slick.
"Fits somewhat small for size.  It will still fit, just tight.  Material feels a little bit itchy when wearing it."
"Not that easy to put on, Certainly doesn't look like the picture."
Bought it for traveling. Don't need it or airline traveling after all. It's a bit flimsy. I should of done more research before I bought it.
"I wear a size 9 and I ordered the medium which was sized at  7.5-9.  It's too small for me - my toes touch the front.  Even if I didn't have that issue, I still wouldn't like them - they are very boxy looking and there isn't a right or left foot slipper."
Overall the coat is nice enough. Except for the large hole in the bottom of one pocket. That's no what I expect when I purchase an item.
Top is way to small!
its like two size too small.
not great material at all. Wouldnt recommend
Went according to measurements but they couldn't be used because they were too small. It was too much of a hassle to bother to return them for the price.
"Seems high quality. The belt is surprisingly stiff. Actually that is beneficial because it prevents the waistband from rolling over when one sits down.

However, after just over a year of daily use (April '12 to May '13) the buckle came off. To enable the ""reversible"" feature, the buckle is attached to the belt via a single, spring-loaded screw. It is a small screw and it broke from simple stress. One cannot simply replace the screw since the end of the screw is still in the base and blocks any new screw one might install.

I would readily buy another Dickies belt, so long as it didn't use this flimsy mechanism to enable ""reversible."""
"Do not recommend this dress. It is SO sheer and does not fit. I have a very slight build (5' 9"" 115 lbs.) and was not happy with the fit of the dress. Moreover, there was extra fabric on one of the top pieces so when I wrapped it the fabric just hung there like an extra appendage. I was so happy when I found this dress online and got for a wedding. However, the colors weren't as vibrant as pictured and it was just a disappointment"
"I am a big fun of Clarks and I have many ones of it with different models. I have one from ?England is perfect i wear it 20 years. My feet size 13M, for this sandal I bought 14M which is somewhat small. The quality going down gradually."
I did not order these. Not my brand!
"Received my order, but one is broken. I would really love another pair."
"Got these in a size 8 for my 46 lb. daughter and after one wash they are extremely tight on her.  She is of average build, not overweight in the slightest."
"I saw this shoe and thought it was really cute. However, when I received them they ran rather small. I am an 8 1/2, but my sister who wears a 7 1/2 was able to fit them. I am quite disappointed as now I have to return them, shop and have shoes shipped within a week for an event I ordered this too small shoe for! Frustrated to say the least."
"Way to small since I have no idea what it look likes.  I ordered it on January 24, 2015 and have yet to receive it...today is March 18, 2015.  The tracking number is a joke......If i ever get to actually hold it and check out the material and put it on my head, I will let you know how well it fit.  At this point one star is being generous.  Good luck with any one else that has ordered this hat.  I hope it is lined with money when i get it so at least i will know it was worth waiting for."
"Boots are very heavy, and make your feet very sweaty.  I ended up cutting them down like ankle boots, and stll don't wear them."
I didn't expect color to be so gawdy.
Poorly made and much smaller than it says on the description
"I'm not going to say I don't have skinny calves - I'm not an athlete with huge calve muscles, and I'm not 200 pounds overweight. I work out, and I have very shapely normal sized legs that are comparable to those you'd see on celebrities in fashion magazines. I have worked hard to have nice legs.

I have been searching for MONTHS for a single pair of boots that don't look like galoshes on me, and with the reviews and measurements of these boots I thought for sure these would fit me.

Alas, I got them, and they are HUGE in the calf section, and baggy even with a thick pair of jeans on. So - these boots, just like EVERY SINGLE OTHER PAIR that have been made this season, are great if you are an athlete with large calves or overweight.

The assistant at Nordstrom told me ""most women usually complain that the boots are too tight around the calves, this year we've seen all our boots with extended and wide calves"". Well congratulations to Obese America for finally getting everything made to fit you instead of going to the gym to actually get healthy. Now I apparently need to gain about 20 pounds in my calves if I want to buy a new pair of boots this year.

This makes me sick."
I ordered my regular size. 32FF. It is a very flimsy bra. Not good support. Material very thin and would easily rip if worn more than a few times. Straps very thin for the size cups as well. Returning this one.
its cute but way too small. even the large probably would have been too small
could be so cute - weird cut and uncomfortable.
"This vest fits great and the length is perfect to wear with leggings or skinny jeans. It can actually be worn with anything, but leggings and skinny jeans are the reason I bought it.  The material doesn't feel super luxurious to me; it's thin-ish but not super thin.  For the price it should have been a better quality, but it's what I needed and really couldn't find it anywhere else, so I bought it.  I've talked myself out of buyer's remorse but really should have sent it back, solely due to quality v. price.  It's a nice light weight wool vest and I'm keeping it.

UPDATE 11/26/14:  Today is only the 3rd time I'm wearing this rather expensive vest.  It is pilling where my upper arm and side chest meet, which is making me kick myself for not sending this overly expensive, mediocre quality vest back.  Live and learn.  I do not recommend this vest."
"These are good for someone on a budget but I recommend going for AvidLove thongs. These things come from China (not a fan of supporting overseas), they don't last long, the first set I bought lasted maybe 6 months before started getting holes on the sides. The AvidLove thongs are great, zero fabric on the sides, I don't need to use curb corn starch or anything while wearing the AvidLove like I needed to with these and the product is roughly $20 more expensive (well worth the price). By the way, I have about a 38 waist, so I ordered size large (goes up to 39 waste), with the AvidLove and they fit beautifully."
"Disclaimer: did not buy. Might buy if had any idea what size choices mean. Size chart no assist: gives numerical size guide for general use. Order choices are small, medium, etc. No detail."
Straps too tight
"I really want to like these because they are cute in person, however, the size 10 was too big for my foot, and I am a true size 10. I probably could have made it work,  but the top reason I am returning these is because the material, which is like a suede type material (I don't know what the actual material is you would have to look it up in product description) anyway, the material literally attracts everything! I put them on when I got them in the Mail today and just walked around my kitchen/living room area to see how they felt, I took them off and picked them up and WOW!!! They had collected the dog hair and food crumbs that were on my floor! And i don't mean the bottom on the show collected that stuff, the actual shoe above the sole, was a completely dust/hair catcher! I wish I took a picture of it, but unfortunately I already used my pet hair/lint sticky roller to remove all that crap so that I can return them. Thats a problem for me, if I am wearing those I don't want them to constantly be looking dirty because they collect whatever you are walking through. They are cute though! Also, I guess you get what you pay for, because they are also pretty flimsy."
Very hard to open & close.
"Really small squared set of sunglasses, for the exagertaed description given."
"I thought that this shoe would be my answer in lieu of wearing heels during the fall...it's not.  It is extremely hard, doesn't bend, uncomfortable instep...I'm returning it!"
"Crotch ripped out on first use.  Material seems to be good, but poor stitching."
"I don't have narrow feet and these sandals were way too wide and slipped all over the place when I tried them on, other than the fact they don't fit they are super cute if I just want to look at them on the shelf! Very disappointed."
"First off, I would like to thank those who answered my question concerning this band-- actually, the Casio replacement band. It's truly a shame that a very good watch like the Waveceptor is, in my opinion at least, rendered pretty much useless by this band which is absolutely horrible. And the Casio replacement band is the only band that will fit. Oh, well."
"Shirt is very large, definietly go a size down. As for the 2/5, the shirt does have a nice fabric, but it just isn't made well. The picture on amazon is almost misleading, with the perfectly overlying pattern and pocket, it makes it feel like a luxury shirt(together with the price tag), but in all honesty, it's not there. It's hard to button it off without breaking any strings :/"
this is not true to size i wear a size 10 and ordered a size 10 they don't fit too well. If u are going to order i recommend going a size up. Overall they are decent.
Love this brand. Having a hard time because the different styles of shoes all run different sizes. Have bought and returned 2 pair so far
"I love the look of this belt. I bought a black one and a tan one. It has one major defect though. When putting the end of the belt through the buckle to put ion on, the inside of the buckle scratches the leather. Both of my belts have serious scratches in the leather, which makes the original color of the leather show through. This is very very disappointing after paying so much for two leather belts."
"I didn't purchase from Amazon, but I did purchase this exact backpack elsewhere. My daughter loved it, and has been bragging to everyone about it.
This thing lasted less than 1 day of school before one of the two straps that hold the lunch box to the backpack ripped at the seam.
Additionally, the zipper on the lunch kit is already getting tight and the insulation in the lunch box is mediocre at best.
I will never be purchasing anything from Global Design Concepts again."
"Great shirt but though the tag says 3x, it is more like a large."
"Went to return them because... you know, one of them has a shattered lens but despite them being Prime and BROKEN I can't return them? Poorly done, guys.

***

I knew these were going to be cheap, but they're so cheap that I'm scared just opening and folding the temples will snap them in half. Also, one of the lenses was shattered in the corner. I guess these are worth buying for a one-time costume but that's about it."
"Use a garbage bag and a vaccum cleaner, works better for cheaper."
"Nice shoes but when I opened the box, I was shocked to see a pair of used/returned shoes with stains are in 3 places, bottom of shoes are not even wiped clean. I was wondering why someone returned it, it turned out a pair of defect shoes."
"Very cute and fit well, but split at the crotch after one wear (actually during). Very thin material and seams are not secure. At least not on the pair I received. Difficult to sew, since the fabric is thin and stretchy. They are very nice to look at, and if you don't mind sewing them every once in a while, your child will probably like them."
I have had it for less than a month and the back is already separating. It is a cheap iPhone case with faux leather glued onto the back of it. I am very disappointed because it is a fantastic idea if it was backed by equal quality. Unbelievable...
A little tight!!!!
This dress was way too small on the top and crooked
these fit like boxers.....
I did not even open the package yet and knew the cup was too small.  The band is way to big.  This is good for a chubby pre puberty child.  I saw another reviewer with my same bra size say it fit her well.  I am a 32/G us in many bras so I ordered it..  This cup looked like it would not fit a 34d.  Maybe a 34c or a 36b?  I will be returning this tomorrow.  Yucky fabric.  Did not feel like it had that much cotton in it.
"Cheap and not well made, plus after paying shipping I had to pay more postage to get on delivery"
"One star. There are four reasons for this.  First, the area by my small two on the left shoe has worn a hole through the fabric. Second, the same things is happening on the right shoe. Third, the sole is becoming unglued. Fourth, these shoes are only two months old! The pictures show that they are new looking except for the wear and tear described.

The disappointing thing is that I take good care of my shoes and I paid for these specifically because Asics reputation is solid.  But this pair of shoes is a major disappointment...  there is no way I can recommend the Gel Cumulus under these conditions."
"I love Birkenstock shoes because of the comfort and have worn them since the 80's.  This pair had to be returned because they sent me the wrong size. I have several other Sidney style and I love them.  I wear them all day and every day of the spring, summer, and fall. When the snow flies then I have to wear something different. I also wear the Arizona, Florida, and Orlando. I own probably 16 pair and they are all 36 M (called regular width) and they sent me 36 N (narrow)."
It fits weirdly.  The neckhole is too big.  It's too small around the middle.
I'm dissatisfied because I ordered the navy color and it is not a solid color navy; it is mottled which is not what I wanted.
"i was so disappointed. i love puma shoes and i was so excited to get a flat from them. i thought they were going to be the most comfortable shoe ever, but i was wrong. they're super tight and narrow and crush down on your toes."
Arms were very short after washing it and i did not put it in the dryer!
Bust area too small.
"I bought 3 sets of these shoes which all slip off at the back although I chose the right size.  The platform cracks, the fabric peels off and before you know it, your shoes need to be dumped!"
"I purchased this item so that I could wear some of my necklaces in a different way. When it arrived, I was underwhelmed. The clip is small and has a dull finish. The hinge is ok, but the closure seems a little flimsy. I think I'd have better luck using a small hoop earring to secure my necklaces instead of this item. It's going back to Amazon."
Burst easy
"I expected these to be thick and warm and they sadly weren't. The material was about as think as my other leggings with a thin soft fleece lining. I'm just under 5""4' and 135lbs and they were baggy in some places and much too long for me. I am returning them."
"These shoes run large, and are not as comfortable as described. I wouldn't dare wear these for work. They are large/loose in height and length, but still narrow in the front just behind the toe box. I've bought much better, much more comfortable footwear for less money than these shoes cost.

I like the color and texture of the material, but don't know how they will look & feel after washing. They look OK, but they feel cheap on my feet, and I won't buy another pair. I wish I had returned them, but thought that if I bought better insoles they would be comfortable, but they really aren't, and I have to wear extra thick socks with these although I still need to stretch them behind the toe boxes. I regret that I threw out the box and cannot return them. They are a waste of my money."
Looked cheap ...I returned it
It has been a year since purchase and the sole has detached from the shoe.  I have purchased Dr. Martens before and this has never happened.  Previously the shoes have lasted much longer.
"I can tell these sandals have good support in the sole but the strap was unbearable to try and break in so I returned them.  I wore them around my house numerous times to see how long it would take and even after short period like 10-15 minutes, there would be large red marks from the strap on the inside of the sandal.
I wish the straps where easier to break in because I really need a sandal that has good support for my pronating feet."
They were too narrow - more so than a typical B width boot.  I also did not like the tongue is taller than the rest of the boot and seems overly long in comparison.
I didn't read the description well.
Cute design but a little girl sat on my dress at Disney and it broke at the zipper line couldn't be fixed and I had to be safety pinned back together. Cheaply made
These are not identical to the FOL Breathable in the store. Not the same fabric.
"Runs big!!!  I ordered the 5-5.5 which are sizes I can wear and sometimes depending on the style a 6.  These fit more like a 6-6.5.  Very nice shoe and looks great on but it was loose around the ankle and since it was big, there was about an extra inch  in the front and back.  If they had a 4-4.5 I would exchange them but since they don't come in a smaller size I have to return them."
"I am a size 8 to 10 and ordered a 12/14 so I would be comfortable. I could barely close the back, the top looked like scales and three weeks later I am still  picking up glitter all over the house. Just a weird fit, made me look shapeless."
the front is thi big.
"Ordered the wrong size and color, but overall I wasn't very happy with the texture, a little too scratchy. Through this I'm not even really sure if light/flesh colored leggings are my thing."
"I did order the next size up but it was still a bit to snug. I contacted Lees, I was told I needed to send it back myself .
If they used UPS they offer a return service, I probably would have my new shirts, as it is, the Post Office are closed on Saturday in my area so I still have shirts that don't fit. I will think twice before I order from this company again."
"This skirt fits horrible unless you have a big, big, big behind. I returned mine for obvious reason. Team flat."
really big.
Hand feel is nice but quality should be higher for the price paid. I've had two break on me within a month.
These kept slipping under my heel... annoying.
Outfit isn't bad but the poor beard quality makes this worthless.
Top mirror portion came off.
"I love Crocs, but not this one.  The design has a flaw  close to the side buttons.  A good pair of flip flop should  feel if you were not wearing anything.  This one, I love the style, but I constantly feel something is bothering me.  I am returning them.  Amazon is great with their services.  The 2 stars is for the services."
"This is a terrible wallet. It's the thinnest leather I've ever seen a wallet made of. Seems like the maker is definitely trying to make this product as cheaply and with as little material as possible. As far as the blocking aspect Kama I am skeptical that a wallet so thin and so flimsy could protect anybody's cards from anything! I bought this wallet for my son for Christmas, and I'm sending it back. I didn't even bother giving it to him."
These were not the bows I was looking for to small
very shinny material that looks cheap
"Didn't fit, been wearing the same size bra for nearly 15 yrs and this is why i don't like to purchase online, way to small"
Fabric very poor
"We have returned shots because we did not take the tour
Thanks"
"I bought these because I have worn Merrell's for years.  The first problem they are small and tight.  Next problem was heel seems
to be lower that my other jungle mocks.  Because of the type shoe I tried them on the carpet and heel height inside of shoe is lower.
I put them in the box to maybe return them.  My fault I forgot about them.  I was reminded by an advertisement for Merrell shoes and the window to return them has passed.  It was a mistake I made but the point is the shoe is not like any other Merrell shoes I have. Your foot seems to set flat inside the shoe and not the heel  height for a normal Merrell Shoe.  (I only wear Merrell shoes and have
several pair now. So I know how they fit.)  If your looking for a beach shoe there are many out there without the Merrell name at a
lower price."
"There is not much stretch in these panties, and being high-content cotton, my pants and skirts don't ""glide"" over them."
"These socks are too tight. They should've been knee high so they may act as compression socks instead.
Because they are only calf high, my legs became so swollen above the rim of the sock where ever it ended up."
"It is not as cool as it looks in the picture and this jacket is HUGE! My boyfriend is a medium/large. I had my doubts of what size to buy, but even if it was too big I was thinking of just giving it to my brother who is much larger. This jacket could fit a small family inside it. The material looks very cheap. Even if it did fit, I still would have returned it."
"I bought these since they looked cute, but this photo is quite deceptive.  There is only that ""leather"" paneling on one side of each leg, and it doesn't go up in such a steep diagonal...not nearly as flattering.  I'm usually a small, so ordered a medium just in case, but they won't even go over my butt!  But the legs are baggy...so I assume these are for women with absolutely no butt whatsoever.  Immediate return."
They ripped the first time my son wore them. Canvas tore. 5 inch rip right along the sole.
Listen to everyone when they say they are too small .. I should have listened 
"I ordered these in black and they seemed nice enough, but  I could barely force my foot in. It seems to be a full size short and a width narrow -- I ordered a 7.5 WW and could have used an 8.5, I think. Since returns aren't free I will not find out."
They break really easy don't waste your money
The material is cheap and scratches in weird spots.
"They are the smallest 8 I have every purchased.  Maybe more like a 7 and wide calf is not wide, it is about 3/4 inch larger than a typical width.  I have to send them back.  However, if the calf was a tad bit wider, I would simply exchange them for a larger size.  The material is good, they appear to be well made and the leather is a perfect texture for semi-dress boot."
"I have had these slippers before and liked them.  However, the elastic gore across the top of the foot is too tight on this pair.  They don't feel as wide as the last ones I had (I ordered a 9W).  Since I used my AMEX points to buy them (they only cost $13), it would cost me more to return them, so I will keep them."
"These undershirts are not soft at all and are such a poor fit on my 21 month old.  She is small for her age so maybe because they are a bit big they fit poorly, but the quality of the cotton is not good at all.  The Carter's brand camisoles are so much better, yes they are more expensive, but worth it if you are looking for something for a young toddler that is comfortable and will last."
"I'm slim and this was way too big for me. I have three other Levi's t-shirts (all purchased from Sears) and two Levi's button up shirts and they all fit perfectly. This shirt was 3 inches wider than my other Levi's t-shirts. Took all the other colors of the same shirt off my Wishlist. Don't recommend if you are looking for a modern fit. However, if you are looking for a more loose fitting fit, then by all means, this will probably be a great shirt for you. Just don't use your other Levi's t-shirts as your reference point (unless it's the same cut as this one).

Peace."
"I tried to brake this shoes for over 4 months, but they kept robbing my little toe to the point I got big calluses. I wanted to love them and kept wearing them, but it got worse and worse..."
"I was planning to wear this dress as a costume so I didn't really mind the quality of the fabric. Would never ever wear this if it were a dress for an event.  The fabric is fairly cheap looking. But the most disappointing aspect of this dress is that the sizing is way, way off."
not a good fabric at all
I hate the way that these bracelets are connected.
"Too bulky and heavy to be practical for traveling. I had to return & exchange this for a different umbrella. Product description did not match product received. Not a bad umbrella, just not what I was looking for."
I wanted to love these shoes but the toe box was just too small even though I ordered my usual size. I have another red pair that fit just fine.
"Never got to wear earrings, the post broke off one of them when i tried to put them on.  Disappointing."
The length of medium size is much longer than other brands.
"What is the inseam. I am of avg.height 5ft 5 "" Jeans are either too short or too long."
I actually couldn't even get my foot in it. I take size 6 US and 36 EUR and have never had a problem before.
"Returned them they fit so small, you need to get one full size bigger or maybe more"
I previously purchased this dress in black so I know what it is supposed to be like! In black this dress seems to be made of mostly cotton with some stretch material. This new purchase in red seems to be made of polyester nylon (really cheap). There is stitching in the torso area unlike the smooth finish in the photo. Don't buy this dress it's misleading and false advertisement. The old bait and switch. How bout you give me my money back crooks. I haven't even tried the trite dress on.
"I like the style of this shoe, but it seems like they were made of some cheap leatherlike plastic, therefore they squeak. Disappointed."
"I do not have a big head, but this constantly popped off.  I wasted my money."
These slip down in your shoes when both socks and shoes should fit. Buy cotton.
Nice looking shoe and I have always worn Merrill. This shoe has a small toe box and even increasing the size of the shoe didn't improve the fit. If you like a tight toe box you might like it. If not try another shoe.
"Considering the price I paid for it, I suppose I shouldn't complain. However, it broke into a million pieces after dancing for a few hours at a wedding. Would not suggest buying"
"Oh my gracious these were huge!  My daughter weighs about 128 and wears size 4-6.  These were enormous on her!  She has a generous booty and usually needs a small in most pants.  These were huge.  What was worse....they look and sound like a plastic table cloth. They do not have cotton in them and you can really tell.  The swooshy sound when she walked was hysterical.  That would be totally distracting in a kitchen. On the positive side....she is 5'5"" and the length was perfect.  Could not get past the material, size, and noise.  I had to return them."
"Sweatshirt material. Wind will cut right through this jacket.

I am 6'2"" and about 200lbs and got the largest size they have. Barely fit with my wide chest. Enjoyed it while it lasted.

Inside of jacket sheds onto any shirts worn beneath it (don't wear white if you got the black jacket). I washed it and let it dry and now the nice clean appeal of it is ruined and it is worse than my cheapest sweater after years of wear and tear.

I like the brand of clothing (despite most of it not being meant for a guy my size) but I will be highly more skeptical in the future.

All the cons being said, it was very nice (despite the popped collar and the studs on the shoulders attempting to appear punk-ish)"
Get the more expensive ones. These you can see through see materials it makes you look like you have huge nipples. Not attractive! I guess these would work ok if you wore a thin bra with them but that was pointless for me because I bought these to wear with a backless maxi dress. The other brand is much better.
"The right foot was comfortable.  The insole on the lest foot was not.  The sides of the insole were too vertical, which hurt my foot. Since I don't need special insoles, I'm not going to replace them in brand new shoes.  They are also strangely fuzzy.  As such, they pick up lint/dog and cat hair.  No thanks.  They went back."
"This skirt could be okay but the fabric is very low quality so it looks ""costume-y"". Its also rather lazily made. I did not keep this skirt as I found it unflattering."
"I should have heeded the reviewer who said that the ""fit of the shoe was off"" and to ""try before you buy.""  The shoe looks nice, but they do not have the ""cushiony"" feel like my other sneakers or the other pair that I bought (a different brand).  I tried these shoes on walking around the house, etc.  I walked up stairs and although it seemed that I could feel the stair under my soul, I decided to keep them.  That was a big mistake.  I went shopping in them.  The left shoe was a really big problem, and the right foot was a problem.  First my big toe seem to be hitting the top part of the shoe.  The more I walked, the more my foot seemed to be moving toward the front of the shoe.  I am not sure I am describing this correctly.  But after 2 hours of shopping, the front portion of my feet were hurting terribly.  I tried pushing my heel back in the shoe, but that did not work.  Eventually I tried balling my toes up.  Needless to say, I was glad when I got home and could take them off.  I would, if I could, send them back, but I had walked outside in them.  So I'll keep them, and try using them for very short periods of time.  This shoe is so bad, that it almost turned me against Easy Spirits, but then I looked at my shoes and a lot of them are Easy Spirits.."
I didn't like these scrubs the size was small. They didn't fit normal.  Top fit tight and pants not at all
"The recommendation was for a 10, which was too big my an inch in the heel. I returned and ordered the 9 and its tight!! What ever happened to half sizes? I'm hoping they break in along with my aching arthritic knees getting used to them. Excellent quality aside from that. Don't emphasize the fact that I have ""duck feet""..haha."
This never worked piece of crap. This product does not do what it was suppose to do. Cheap and crappy.
Very thin and awkward fit for such a pricey pair of leggings. Fit as expected but felt like the quality should be better in terms of thickness and bump accommodation. I recommend the Spanx maternity leggings or JCrew signature leggings as alternatives.
I had to return this.  It felt like it was very good quality but it was too large for my liking.  The unique shape did not work for me.
The rubber on the tip of the toe is started to come off both shoes after 4 weeks of wearing them.  This is a bummer because I won't be able to glue it back up and make it look good.
"The proportions of this were really weird. I have a petite torso, but this was giving me serious camel toe, and the leg cut was more 80's Baywatch, coming wayy higher than pictured. And on me, the bust was not as modest as pictured, I got quite a lot of cleavage. Yet somehow, the straps were loose. I went off the size guide, so it should have fit better."
"Further affirms the reality that trying on jeans first is a must.  These jeans are elastic, stretchy.  I did not read the description very well."
hi i took out the watch one day and i found it broken can i get a replacement
"I bought these shoes because of the color cute, but when I got them they were a 1/5 size bigger so definetely not true to size, had to end up selling them"
"Im a L, so I order it XL. It didn't fit so well. It is see thru, the lace limits movement, and the details on the top part of the lace kind of drop down making it look not so good. But you get what you pay for..."
It's looks very cheap unisex watch . I'm not going to wear air and as a gift l don't know what to say ....
returned arrive crushed
"They don't fit well, the elastic band is too thin... much smaller than it looks in the picture. The fabric is also too sheer. Even though they are black, you can see right through them."
I thought I like it but it was broken soon as I took it out the pack
"The shoe is beautiful to look at and the inside sole when touch is soft and comfortable. However, on both shoes the area around the buckles makes the shoes unwearable. Serves me right for not having read some of the reviews. I tried for two days to ""break the shoe in"".  That isn't the problem, as I even bought the shoe a 1/2 size larger than my normal shoe size. The front buckles make your toes go numb. I don't if the placement is poor or if the area underneath needed more padding. Heavy socks, band-aids on the toes did not help. Sadly I will be giving these shoes after 2 wearing to either charity [but I really hate to impose that pain on anyone else] or placing them in the trash bin. Total waste of money."
"Way too tight, stiff and scratchy and hard to pull up. Wore it once and it was very uncomfortable. Too small as well. Should have sent it back."
Product quality is great... but this shirt has the wrong dimensions. I can't wear it. I have bought other designs that were also L with no issues at all. Too bad.
"Small on the waist compared to the straight fit of the same W size, and too large on the rest. I had to return it. The straight fit, straight leg however is perfect."
I returned these Boots because I inadvertently ordered them by mistake.
"These are cute slippers but they did not last long. My kid wears this inside the house but he's active, it only took a few weeks and these started to wear off and tear at the toes section. Didn't even last us two months. I threw it away and got something with a thicker sole."
"Disappointed it's so much bigger than I thought, and almost as big as my smallest rolling suitcase. This wouldn't fit under an airplane seat if it's packed full. It's also extremely difficult to look inside, the opening is weirdly big but tight. It doesn't open wide in order to look around for things easily. Of course, you can open the folded edges to expand the opening but they are difficult to close again. It also doesn't stand upright on the wheels allowing it to tip over. I sent it back for all these reasons."
Cute shoes but after first wear the bottom edge is pulled away from the shoe at the end of the toe area. I'm disappointed at this cost that the show would come apart right away. It makes me wonder if they are authentic or not. Do Chuck Taylors normally do this? (insert sad trombone sound)
"The numerous credit card pockets are a nice feature and the wallet looks nice. However, the card slots are too small to properly get credit or other cards into and out of this wallet for actual use. This wallet was described as having a lot of capacity for cards, etc., though trying to fill it with less than half of the cards I keep in my old Eagle Creek tri-fold wallet, this wallet can't even be closed. Unless you only plan to carry a little bit of cash and a couple of cards and your license, this wallet is near useless. I immediately returned this item for the reasons noted. I think this is the first time I've had to return anything to Amazon, and I couldn't be happier with the process for returning. They make it very easy and painless to accomplish returns. Just be certain to hang onto all of your original packaging until you're absolutely sure you don't plan on returning your purchase.."
"This costume enables cultural appropriation and is not suitable. A person's heritage is not to be bought or sold. In fact, this kind of mockery is quite racist."
"I only gave it 2 stars because they are not made with quality. They are hand made I believe unless the machines they use were off... The one I received was going to be a gift for a Harry Potter fan obviously. But when I got it I looked at it and it looked... Bad. All the pieces were there but each piece of leather wasn't the same length so when you wore it, some strands would be longer/shorter causing it to bunch up and look funny. So before giving it to her I had to actually undo the clamps on the end and make the leather the same length and clamp it up. All in all not a long process if you know what your doing."
"With the socks made in China, the sizes are not clear, so I got the wrong size. would not buy again."
The orange color was more extreme than the picture.  Could only be worn on Halloween.
"Runs small, stinks.  Literally, smells bad.  Not sure if it will shrink even washed in cold water.  Was LATE in arrival."
"I bought these about a year a ago in Myrtle beach on vacation. I figured the would break in over time like most shoes. They did not. I live in Michigan so we only have summers for a few months but the many times I tried to wear them, I ended up getting major blisters because of the actual rubber piece between my toes. I wear thing sandals all summer long with no problems but these are cheaply made in my opinion with sharpe rubber that just irritates your skin causing blisters. I have 3 other pair of sidewalk surfers and the yoga thong sandal both of which are very comfortable. This product is similar to the cheap thongs you'd buy at Walmart... Choose another sandal."
"This ring is very thin and might work for someone with short and slender fingers. It's also dark, which is to be expected of course since it IS ""antique look"",  but for someone like me with long and slender fingers it would only work with a whole bunch of other stackables; it looks like just a dark string of textured metal on my hand."
Broke after wearing one time
Good American apparel easy jean knock off but not the same quality so they ripped after about 2 months .They fade after one wash and have a smell you can't get out.  Not ordering again. I'd rather spend the full 80 on the AA jeans. They last longer.
bad article
"I bought these because they were recommended, on another website, for people with plantar fasciitis.  They do have decent (not great) arch support, but clogs are not good for this because you have to scrunch your toes to keep them on when you walk.  Also, the little flap that sticks up at the heel ends up under your heel, causing pain.  The flap should either go away or be made higher.  I always wear a size 38 (size 8 U.S.), but I heard they run small and got a 39.  They were tight.  On the positive side, the fabric is very nice and warm, and the sole is nice for hanging out in the house.  I am having a lot of trouble finding well designed house slippers."
I really wanted to love these as the price is right but they are extremely heavy and clunky feeling. Was looking for a light weight indoor type of flip flop and sadly these are not that shoe so going back..
Don't proceed and buy. This shoe fits to size but the zipper in the back hurts as it pinches the back of your leg.  Your foot also slides down to the bottom so your toes are hanging over the edge looks so weird.
Shirt is for asian men not American men. It should state in future. I loved the style it just don't fit a true 3x man
"Width is perfect, but length of shoe is too long for a size 10.  Feels more like a size 11."
"I returned them, not supportive enough for my feet. Heel felt
Too low."
"I seriously have a battle with this thing every time I try to put it on.  I hop around the room, swear, and struggle, until I finally manage to pull up down.  And I'm not overweight at all!  After its on, if you happen to sweat anywhere on your chest, somehow this thing makes it worse.  It not only doesn't absorb, but seems to repel sweat onto anything it touches."
"Not only are these briefs oddly oversized -- they are kind of like granny bloomers  --  but the elastic around the thighs is practically non-existent.
The reason for wearing tighty whities in the first place -- support -- is a complete after thought.  You get what you pay for.  Don't pay for this!"
Broke after one wash.
Its a pretty cheap material and one side didn't even have the velcro that connects the cape to it. It seemed cool but save your money
"My feet, 6 medium (via usual metal measuring tool). My left, larger; still a 6. Arches, average. Foot shape, between ""tapering toes"" & ""square"" (see pix). At 5'2 & 119, neither are my feet chubby; 58 years, no foot issues. 1/22/16, ordered a 6 med; was long enough, no toe-touching; width, snug. Removed my thin sock, the left was still so snug it squeezed a foot bone which ""moved/clicked"" as I walked. Time won't fix this much ""snug""; my feet deserve wider from the start anyways. INNER sole is completely flat; NO arch despite the looks of the outer rubber sole & reviews raving about ""support"" of which I read 12+ pages before deciding to buy. The ""comfort"" reviews along with the looks of the outer sole led me to presume that the inner might be support-shaped; no, it's flat; hope my pix show that. Inner liner is NOT real sheepskin fleece; it's labeled: ""60% sheepskin; 40% polyester""; zoom to view. ""Stone"" = light & dark taupe. I photo'd it atop my ""Graystone Metallic"" 08 Tahoe (google the color) in sun to compare. Free Shipping; free return; yay Amazon!"
has rainbow shine on them look stupid
I liked it but yes to small i cant wear it as a dress but as a shirt :( with some cotton leggings will di so order 2 times bigger unless you are little and petite
"Half the stones were missing, very disappointed"
I loved these shoes- they are so cute and the price was right but when they came they were way too small! I am always a size seven but I could barely get my foot in these. They also had a very strong smell. A 7.5 wasn't available so now I'm just out of luck which stinks!
not sure if I'm keeping it
Ordered RED got pink
THe boots were nice but way too small. THe material on the inside was cut too far from the toe. They lose a lot of room with the design flaw.
Described as navy blue. I didn't see navy. Color is lighter and brighter. Nice shoe. But not the color I was looking for.
The skirt I purchased and the one I received are completely different. Mine did not come with a bow attached at all. The hem on the skirt is uneven. Definitely not flattering. Highly disappointed in this because I was really hoping to wear it for Valentine's Day.
"Nice jacket - works well over a hooded sweatshirt, but alone the fit is fairly large.  I could also do without the Velcro closures over the zipper, as they tend to get in the way when trying to zip up.  All in all, it's a keeper, but not as versatile as I'd prefer.
Update: Zipper broke after only a few weeks of light use.  Returned for refund.  Lowered to one star."
"I just received the necklace today. It is absolutely beautiful and sooo sparkly! It is prettier than in the picture. I am very pleased with this necklace set. ************  I am changing my 5 star rating to a 1 because I only got to wear the necklace for about 5 minutes to my son's wedding and it broke apart into 3 pieces and fell to the ground. It's a good thing I had another set of jewelry in the car, ( I couldn't decide which one I wanted to wear and brought both). It is very pretty, but it is junk."
"DO NOt buy this shirt in white.  All the stitching is done in a baby blue color thread, including the top stitching. And it is double stitched in blue around the outside of the pocket too, and sticks out like a sore thumb, looks like a reject! In the picture it looks like white stitching, and in the description it does not alert you to that fact.  Ordered two of these because I thought the first one was a mistake, but the second one was sewn the same way with the blue thread. I had to return them both. I don't know what color thread they use in the other colored shirts, but this is a seriously bad idea!"
The ring I received has 1 CZ looks very different .... not happy
"This purse looked exactly as shown and the leather was soft.  However as soon as I opened the outside snap, the snap ripped out.  I had read reviews in which others had the same experience, but there were so many good reviews that I took my chances.  I gambled and lost.  I sent the purse back and got my refund within 24 hours."
"No back support, was not comfortable. I would opt for the warner's wire free bra instead. Dissappointed"
Yeah I guess I can pass it on to my tween daughter. If you have any hips this isn't for you. Very cheaply made.
Do not buy for the price they  are cheating u the opal looks like the top is broke off and some of the stones had fallen out read the reviews they got a lot of bad ones. You have to pay return postage. It is junk looks like it came out of a bubblegum machine.
"The purpose of packing cubes is three-fold: keep you organized, save space in your luggage, and help you pack more stuff.

These ebags packing cubes serve the first purpose well, but the second two they only nominally help with. They are fairly sturdy material with quality zippers and nice mesh panels so you can see what's inside and let clothes breath. Unfortunately, each packing cube has a big old bulky thick plastic logo sown on the front, which contributes significantly to the weight, dimensions, and space occupied by the cubes.

As a result of these logos, you're actively losing space in your bag. It might not seem like a lot, but every little bit adds up, especially in vertical packing space. Each time you open your suitcase and wonder why you can't fit more, you'll be reminded of the reason: ebags wants you to know who designed this mediocre product."
not fun
Too tight on top and less tight below....should be the opposite.
These are a little thin. And leave behind TONS of colored lint. I don't wear them as a result
"I wear vionic and decided to try this brand instead. Sadly, these feel like a cheap imitation. Support is certainly not even close to vionic. As I need the orthopedic support to prevent back pain, I returned these. If that is not a must, they may work wonderfully for you."
"pants wore out fast, after 4 months the pants had holes in them from wear."
After just a few uses pants started to get wet. Do not buy it. And they do not accept a return.
This bra feels good for about the first 2 hours you wear it. Then the band that goes across your rib cage gets bunched up and twisted and it diggs into your skin. I am always having to go into the bathroom and pull it down or readjust during the day. Also the cup is shaped like a cone under your shirt ( SO NOT NATURAL LOOKING AT ALL) Also the cone shaped cup material ruchees from the nipple up to the arm strap after you have been waering it awhile. This product is not worth your money. Mine went to the goodwill.
"The size is right (I bought a bit bigger than usual) and the quality is fine, but the fabric is pretty hard and tough. After the first washing, it was still like a sheet of metal, impossible to iron properly. I will see what subsequent washing will do, but so far, I am disappointed."
"To small sizing different, I wear all that size. Not very happy, they are very cute."
the fabic is just ugly make sureyou have a black slip under because it is like some white see thur paper just ugly never again
Product balls up
"I don't agree that it works. It doesn't stay in place,
It just dangles loosely even after adjusting. Overpriced in my view. Just a cloth strap & metal clips for usd 9.99.
I recommend Simple Wishes Hands Free Breastpump Bra, not this."
"There is quite a bit of ""cardboard"" inside that separates the compartments and at the bottom of the bag. It makes the bag heavy to begin with BEFORE you even throw all of your junk into it."
I can't testify as to the durability of these boots as I have to return them. I wear a size 10.5 in athletic shoes and most boots I wear are around 8.-9.5.  I ordered these in both a 10 and a 10.5 and it's as if the length of the boot didn't change at all.  The width of the heel changed which is bad for me because I have narrow heels.  But as of now my big toe touches the edge in BOTH sizes. No point in ordering a size 11 as my heel would flop around in the back. Otherwise they seemed like they would have been good boots.
"Ugly shoes, make me look like grandpa & grandma shoe style. Good chew toy for my dogs."
"I have 2 more Le Zip Tote in other color, this Far and Away is the worst. The febric looks like a plastic bag, not as good as the picture."
Ripped in two washes.
I didn't realize they were wide width... Too big for my son he has narrow feet
"This is a sparkly-awesome ring for the price.  The stones are good-sized and have great clarity.  My only complaint is that the poor cut of the stones results in a central window where, when looking down on the stones, the wearer's skin is seen.  Sadly returned it."
I certainly would not buy this again and regret that I did.  The collar is stubby and rubs on the neck and the quality of manufacture is very poor.  Before I had even washed it the sash was fraying and is not separated.  The sleeves also seem too short.  Do not recommend.
"These actually fit, and they're not thin crappy see through tee shirts.  However, a couple months later splitting apart at the seams around the arms."
way bigger than I originally thought...wish I could send back since I won't wear it
"Wanted to like this bag soooo much...but it was an albatross around my metaphorical neck on my recent trip.  AND the zipper for the computer compartment broke BEFORE I GOT ON THE FIRST PLANE!  Yeah....no kidding. Was going up an escalator with it and the zipper gave way and my laptop fell out on the escalator!  And this was when I was in the airport near my home about to board the plane for the first leg of my trip!  I researched and researched and researched some more to find the perfect carry-on for my cycling trip to Provence. My BAD - it's not this bag!  At least, not in my opinion. Here's why: 1. If you fill it up and put your computer in the sleeve, it is lopsided and tips over  when you try to stand it up and park it after extending the handle. It has balance issues due to the design.  2. It DID NOT fit under the seat -- way too big even though it matched the specifications for the airline I was flying - AIR FRANCE. 3. IT DID NOT FIT securely on top of my main suitcase so I could use a specially-designed bungee handle thing to strap it on. It kept falling off once I was actually running through airports.  I wanted it because it has the side zipper pockets and I imagined myself using my computer on the airplane to do some last minute reviews of the bike routes that were carefully planned for the trip, BUT - frankly, once this bag was stored in the overhead compartment, I didn't want to deal with it unless I had to. I'm just lucky my laptop wasn't totally wrecked when it tumbled down the escalator due to the zipper failure. Find another bag."
Not as much support as I thought it would be
I ordered these for Zumba and they were not comfortable.
i got them  they were too  small  i  wrot  the company & they said thats all they  had
"I was really excited about this sleeper, but am very disappointed. It is not designed for easy diapering. There are no leg snaps."
One earring was broken when it arrived.  Not pleased w/ quality.
"I love Solar Shields, and I have worn them for years. There are the genuine, brand name Solar Shields and then there are knock offs. These are knock offs-not the real thing . I guess I should have looked for the little copyright symbol.  I returned them. These did not compare in quality to the real thing ."
I wear 48 waistline ordered 52 too small?
They didn't look like the described picture and they irritate my nieces ears. I was not impressed. Made in China junk!
"These boots are cute and fit well, but this review is for whomever sent them. These arrived a week and a half later than expected in a ripped open box that was covered with grease. I'm glad that these boots are sturdy otherwise they'd be ruined."
Too short. Way too short.
"DO NOR BUY if you are slim it is way too large, when i take my jeans off the go with them. However, they are so comfortable very nice for regular bodies but not thin, i might use them as a sleep pants after all -;)"
This came from China. Was not an authentic Harley Davidson product. Screen print was so blurred and off center.
they did not screw on straight.  And if you left them loser to be straight then they fell off. And  very difficult to clean!
"Ended up keeping these though I should have sent them back. The more I wear them the larger they get. The inseam was NOT what was listed, they were at least an inch longer."
"These gloves are made for women with tiny hands and narrow fingers. The gloves barely fit over my hand, and my hand is average size. Only buy these fir small women, cause they will be only ones who can fit them.  I ended up giving them to a friend."
"I thought I was buying lingerie but it wasn't...it was a dress... or was it a dress?? I don't know?! Im confused. What is a ""oneer?"" Anyhow I thought it would be sexy to wear to bed for my boyfriend but I don't think he gets turned on looking at gas station hooker outfit"
"Received on 1/22. On 3/6 the Nike logo started peeling off, JUST outside the return window. Don't buy these. I suspect they may be counterfeit."
Pants were Too large! Returned it
"Advertised as 100% cotton, but the fabric is labeled 90%cotton/10%polyester.

Very annoying."
"It's a rediculous pattern used for this model. Being 5'6"" / 140 pds, I took size XL. I would say, the XL is somewhat in between M and L. It's wide, but very short. It goes about 4"" down from my butt looking more like a blouse to wear with leggings. The sleeves have something weird and uncomfortable to use.
I took light blue that almost matches the picture. The fabric is made of cotton thin enough to use during hot summer.
Since it's not under prime, I will keep it , but won't order again. Still don't know how to use it. Not satisfied with the purchase for the price paid."
Very linty shirt . Also my t was messed up .
Love the cut but runs very very small.  Gave it to a 14 year old friend who is flat chested and it was great on her
"these shoes seem to run in oriental metrics, when you order for U.S. size people it is narrow even in Sperry made product. My experience with Dockers,Isotoner and other brands is the difference in fit when you order the exact same product. I have several pair of Isotoners I ordered from amazon, some Dockers but this is my first Sperry shoes."
Fraying of at the seams and lots of loose string. I didn't wear this and returned it right away along with a couple other colors I got this outfit in for the same reason.
"As a medium with, this shoe can only be worn by a narrow foot.  It was so narrow, I couldn't put my foot in even 1/3 of the way the entrance is SO narrow."
This will not fit a normal size person. A 2x is a US  size medium. Don't buy this if you are larger than a 38 chest
"love the shoes but would have ordered them in ""wide"" if I could have bc the shiney area with the band was TIGHT and not stretchable!"
The price was good but within a few weeks the second hand fell off? Some times saving a little is not worth it. Other than that I liked the solar self sufficient power. Only use these types or auto movement. Watch batteries are bad for the environment.
"I got this robe for Christmas and I loved it, I wore it all the time, and then I washed it.
I washed it in cold water by itself and when I pulled it out of the washer it was no longer White snowflakes, but pink ones. I was so upset. I cannot believe something so well made and perfectly fit would bleed like this. I am really disappointed."
"False advertisement. This wallet will NOT stop RFID scans.

Other than that, looks like a well-made wallet."
"I've been playing Santa for 25 years ... I have authentic high-quality Santa boots and a very high-end costume, except for the belt.  I never got around to replacing that cheap belt.  So this year I thought I'd make the shift. This belt has rave reviews on Amazon and runs about half the price of the leather Santa belts on Amazon, so I thought I'd gamble.  I'm kinda sorry I did.  The only thing that is quality about this belt is the buckle.  It is VERY nice.  But the black Naugahyde is only about 15 - 20% thicker than the cheap belt I had, and frankly, looks about the same.  The rivets in the holes are the exact same cheap metal as on my cheap costume belt.  The buckle is great. The belt?  Meh.  So yes, the buckle is VERY nice, but this belt is not worth the price asked.  I wished I spent the extra money to get a nice leather Santa belt.

By the way, if this is all your budget allows, know that the belt runs pretty large.  If you even think you might need the smaller one, GET THE SMALLER ONE."
I bought these underwear for my son specifically because he wanted Robin Superhero underwear.  The picture shows Batman and Robin so I decided to purchase.  It did NOT come with any Robin underwear.  Overall he likes them but very misleading!!!
They were just wayyyyyyyy too big for MY taste!
Definitely a one and done costume. Don't expect to be able to reuse it. The quality is poor and the sizing is odd. We purchased 2 for a bachelor's party and the shoulder straps on one popped before we even left the house. The hat wouldn't fit on a toddler.
the strap ripped with only two days of use. not a good quality backpack.
Doesn't keep time accurately.
"This rating does not haveanything to do with Amazon.

This is the 2nd pair of NB that I've purchased online and I'm not satisfied with the product.  This pair of NB soles are separating from the shoe.  Be warned, some of the shoes online aren't the real deal - these happen to show made in China on the label and I believe that NB are made in the USA.  I'll be more careful who I buy from next time."
"The onesies have nice colors and fit well, but the thread count of the fabric is very low. Meaning it is very thin and almost see through. I expected something better from gerber."
"Ordered for my daughter, WAYYYYYY tooo small.  from China so returning.....  ?  Probably not.  waste."
"Terrible, cute design but sizes were so off. Ordered a size and a half up and was completely to small. Asked the seller for a refund, don't waste your money!"
This is the worst costume I have ever ordered. I am so disappointed. It is a size Small and it is huge. It is baggy and does not look anything like the picture. I feel totally ripped off. I will never order from tis company again.
"Very thin, broke in the shower."
"These were on Amazon as Prime eligible. Although they didn't come in the 2 day  period I'd expect, they still showed as being set to arrive today.
After my payment info went to the company to complete the order, and after waiting past the stated delivery time to the extended expected delivery day, I found the order had been cancelled. Its supposedly available from other sellers (or at least other company names) ... minus ""Prime eligible"" status, and plus a $3.99 delivery charge. And plus another wait period.

I guess if I believe all that would go well I should ask the Easter bunny for the earrings. Except that the Easter bunny has no interest in payment info.
These earrings are still showing as Prime available from the initial seller, in a slightly lighter color. Guess I could try buying those- or save time and just get a root canal now.

In summary- buyer beware."
I loved the dress color and fabric but it runs small and doesn't come with matching straps only clear
"Loved the look and feel of these sun glasses--much like my Maui Jim's.  However broke right in half 5 days after I got them.  At first I thought it was my fault because they were in my handbag without the case, so I threw them away.  But after I thought about it--I have put every pair of glasses I have ever owned in my bag and none of them broke in half.  ""Unbreakable: should not be in this products name.  Should have returned them for a refund.  Too bad --they are nice looking."
I'm having a proplem with fallen aches and was hoping these would be comfortable.  No suck luck!!!  Please friends check your feet offen and get soom for intersoles.  We all come to needing help with our feet and don't end up helping them like we should
Cheap and too small. Hat wouldn't fit on a 4 yr olds head
"This shoe has size 8.5 labeled on it. But it is no less then a 9.5. Maybe even a 10. I wear 8.5 to 9. So I ordered the 8.5. It was 3 or 4 sizes too large.

The Upper Exterior was man made material. Leather is lined on the inside. The description makes you think the shoe is leather on the exterior as well as the interior. I feel like I was deceived to think I was getting a leather shoe on the outside, and inside.

I have other Stacy Adams shoes in size nine I wear just fine.

Shipping it back costed me $18.50. If I try a new size and it's not right I will have spent $40 shipping them back. I'm not sure if I will ever try to buy shoes online again after this. :o("
"The locket is very cute, however, the latchet will not stay closed. can't put chakra stone in  it. The chain is quite lovely. Would really like to wear it without losing the stones, I am very unhappy about this. How can this be resolved? I really like this locket. I should not have to purchase another to correct this problem. Was going to buy more for Christmas gifts, but am afraid I will get more that are broken."
"The sizes run bigger than expected, not true to size.  Too bad I opened the package; I had to toss them all out.  Waste of money."
Super cute and for the price it was worth it. A few days in some of the rhinestones fell out and then the dangles started breaking off.
the shipping was so long it took around 3 to 4 weeks to come and when it came it came in mail damaged it was broken the necklace I couldn't wear it was broken I have the ear rings now I keep them but the necklace it broke and it easy broke a few times the way it feel I really had wanted this :(
Was wrong item both orders
Arms are too tight and can't be worn in the summer because the fabric is too thick. Didn't fit well so returned
Pants doesn't match but the top and shirt is cute
Weird cut
Not what I had hoped for.  The straps are tight and I still get baggy knees
"price was okay, but shipping costs were ridiculous"
"If I ever were to wear a ""Slim Fit,"" form-fitting pair of jeans, this may be at the top of the list.
Although I was able to suck in my gut and barely button the jeans, there is no way that it is a 44-waist."
I tried this Maidenform slip and another like it with less control. Both were way too small. I wear a size 12 and 36D. Very uncomfortable and gave me more lumps and bumps than I started out with. I'm returning it. Bummed.
It did not work as I expected it too work
"Awful! Ugly, terrible fit, not like the pic. I DO NOT RECCOMMEND THIS."
"Total waste of time. My measurements are 32/22/35, and I'm five seven. It was too long on my body for starters. Couldn't close the bottom hooks and the top ones pushed my chest up awkwardly. The top I could do at about the first or second. The middle needed the tightest, maybe more. I couldn't select one clean row to hook. It looks strange, was too thick to wear under clothing, and was uncomfortable due to the fact that it isn't made for ANY curves at all... Returned it and got the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/YIANNA-Women-s-Latex-Sport-Girdle-Waist-Training-Corset-Waist-Shaper-Black-XS/dp/B00UG293KU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">YIANNA Women's Latex Sport Girdle Waist Training Corset Waist Shaper Black, XS</a>&nbsp;<-- item linked. That one actually works."
"I have no idea why I made the mistake of purchasing these ""organizer bags."" They were supposed to help make traveling more efficient, but they did the opposite. I could have used the plastic bags I get from my local grocery and they would have done a better job. Poor quality, defective and a waste of money."
Flimsy poor quality hat.  Very small hat that bunches up in front.  I gave it to my neighbor. He is not crazy about it either.
Not very well made and the fabric is scratchy. Learning experience for me . Going back....
this was very small and smelled nasty !!!
"For $3.00, what did I expect: quality? This looks wayyyyy better in the picture than in real life and it looks and feels like something that you would get out of one of those .25 cent machines at the grocery store. Or a cheap prize at the carnival. It will probably turn my neck green and fall apart when I first wear it. Maybe if I put it on a better chain or wear it only with turtlenecks? But the pendant itself will still look like it was soldered by a 13 year old (and perhaps it was)."
"A lot of fraying, treads needed to be trimmed and the top portion sits too low cut for work"
Long right. Too heavy for the chain
Dont know yet.... only tried them on.  shopping on sucks when shopping for shoes. hard to find that one.  too costly trying. second one i bought in vain
"Band rolls up and I'm always pulling it down. Might be ok for smaller breasted person, but I am large. This was not the right bra for me."
"These pants are so cheaply made & material is a joke.  No boot cut.  I don't behave large thighs parlor ankles, but pheasants make me feel like I do.  I thought for S49, these would have to be amazing. Up have pants for $12.99. 10 times better material, style, craftsmanship.  The brand isn't sold on Amazon, unfortunately.  However thAt make pants very similar to this at cheap stores for less than $15, but you'll find way better ones at stores.  Not hi end big retail, the mid to lower end, but way better quality & for $85% less.  I recently have gained pads, so Up had to go up a size in my awesome other pants that are really bootleg, way better material, not thick or thin, perfect, have stretch, wide waistband, have control in the right spots, & Make you look like a size 4 if you're a 8 or a 19 T 5'5 or 5'6.  Thess pants would have done nothing for me even at a size 4.  Furthermore, the fabric is so cheap (Yes, I am  vendor, so I know material).  Pockets why?  If boot cut then do boot cut & designer could get better quality & craftsmanship for FREE.  This us how you barter, so easy.  I would send these back I'd the were -$20.  I would keep for no more than $12.99, Maybe.

Unfortunately, these pull on style pants are now popular.  Unfortunately have been weAring fur 10 years.  Didn't hit the USA until a precursors ago.  Also, Amazon dies not have any of these pants for real.  I just bought some other brand, cheaper, better design, but they are a really good quality, cotton seat pants material!  say biot-cut not, too short.

Unfortunately ladies. you're going yo have to actually go to a few stores, when you find them, stock. Up.

What a rip off?  These are hi end pants. A grocery store that sells clothes, shoes, gardening tools, Motorola, You know the store ladies.  Sell these kind if pants, if you like them so much and for $32 less.  You'll probAbly find even more styles with better quality for even less too.
What a waste of my time.  Amazon is really going down with their clothing.  Prices too hi for cheap clothing.  I have money too.  I would pay $ have $250 circa oUr of jeans, because I look fantastic vin them & the quality is fantastic.  If so pay even $35 for 1 clothing item. & it looks like it cist $20- It's going back!  This is Amazon & what it is for.  I am a Prime Member too & I have not been getting my merchandise on times, I was lies to 8 times now for telling me my Credit cards that don't have a limit are declined.  NY card was never even charged, then they told me excuse afyervexcuse, still are.  I was offered a $5 gift certificate fit a $600 order.  Kiss my B-tt
Not too smart Amazon circa customer's spent over $450K USD in 5 years.  I have also been receiving clothing items a lot that you can totally tell have been worn..  Not tried on, but worn.  This has happened on my past 6 orders.
I see this quite a bit with 3rd Party Seller's esp. in shoes.  Amazon refunded me though, or Seller let me keep for Free.  That was 4 years ago though.  Something Free is not a gift when item is damaged, shoes are 2 sizes to small, or stretched out two sizes larger by the previous 5 buyers. even Amazon.

Amazon, has been sending me clothes late, clothing sold by Amazon-Amazon, Used, & Slightly damaged.  Also, Pricey, but cheap quality.  Very disappointed in Amazon.  You see what happens to a company that thinks they're too big to fail.  They will too & hard."
"The sole of this shoe provided no arch support. The label ""Made in the USA"" is questionable.  If these ""New Balance"" shoes are actually made in America we would like to know where exactly they are being manufactured.  We suspect this is another product from Vietnam and is real junk.  Our experience is that most products from Vietnam have very poor quality and workmanship.  These shoes were given to Goodwill just a month after I started wearing them."
"Loved the hat, but the size is more like a boy's NOT a men's size. Two stars for bad advertising."
2nd time I have tried buying this shirt and its just too big no matter what size I order. Its like the shirts were cut the same but they put different labels on it. Also has a very bad smell to it. returning again.
"If you look at the photo, you would assume this bra had some support.  What little support there is goes away after you wash it once.  The stuffing inside got all clumpy too."
"UPDATE 12/26/15: Gone through my second pair of these shoes in about a year. The sole begins to detach from the shoe, making them more water absorbent than a towel. Cant say Id recommend these for the price you're paying.

Good shoes, they do as needed. Comfortable and keep your feet dry, but the durability is questionable. After using them for roughly 7 months, the outer sole of the shoe began to disconnect, allowing water to openly flow into the shoe from the bottom, defeating the purpose of this shoe. They work wonders for the time they last, but I cant say Im happy with their lifespan."
"Yes, I'm serious.

These boots run slightly wide, are lightweight, and very comfortable. They are versatile and go with everything. I put them with casual outfits and somewhat dressy ones.

But they didn't last two months before one of the heels, which appears to have been hollow, shattered into a dozen bits. I know at the price you can't expect the highest quality ever, but WOW. So, ultimately, these boots are not made for walking and I cannot recommend them."
"fits extremely small, not what was expected. for very small tiny woman."
Dirty and small do not buy
"I liked the look of the watch and the silicone band alot, However after about 5 days the watch had condensation under the face and then a few days later it stopped working."
This product looks nothing like the picture shown to you. I guess you get what you pay for. I recommend looking for the cheapest REAL leather jacket. It is better quality and it will last you longer.
sloppy looking and it did not lay well on my body.
The strap broke after 10 months of owning and the shoes were not worn often. The strap pulled away from the bottom while wearing. Poor quality.
Com on son. i cant even fit my booty cheeks in here. it doesnt even lift. it just looks like you got a sideways baby on you butt.
"I paid over $6 for this, which is more than an inexpensive real brush from the beauty isle in the store.  The prongs are very thin and break off easily.  We have had it for about 30 days now and with normal kid use about half of the prongs have broken off.  I replaced it with a real hairbrush for $5 and it works great.  Don't waste your money on the princess logo.  Buy a sticker if you want it to be a princess brush."
"These shoes are fluorescent orange-- like a highlighter.  Nothing red about them.  I could tell the quality and fit would have been great, but the color is really off if you are expecting a red sneaker."
Had to return this after trying it as a coverup.  The fabric is really heavy and not light enough for the beach. I would have burned up in this.
"Cute but they are really wide for being a toddler shoe/boot. The heel came unglued on the one boot within wearing them the first week. Cute boot, poorly made - especially for a toddler/kids boot."
"Very cute but the pants/leggings ripped at the crotch within hours.  The vest seems entirely too big for an 18mo old.  It's adorable, don't get me wrong, but best for a tall skinny child and not for my little ham."
"Cute design but showed every bump, lump and imperfection! ordered the dress in black also and that one hide more of the flaws."
Very uncomfortable to carry with any real weight inside.
"If I could rate a product no starts I would this product.  I was shocked when I pulled it out of the bag.  It looked like it was made for a little girl, not an adult.  I real waste of my time."
"Just like others, I too question the authenticity of these sandles.  I have purchased multiple pairs of the same sandles (different colors) the last 3 years and they are not the same in quality and overall look.  They are much shorter, the foam looks cheaper, and the Teva symbol on the heel is different.  The quality is far inferior to my past Teva purchases. Worn once, and will return if that's an option."
"The picture makes these glasses look much cuter than what they actually are.  They are very cheap looking and the color is not nearly as vibrant as the picture. We ordered the purple.  I would not recommend that color. When I wear them, I look like a little girl playing dress up.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Since I break sunglasses frequently, they won't last long anyway."
"Can shoe companies ever consistently produce sizes?  This company is one of the worst at providing shoes out can count on to fit.  Making it very frustrating to shop online.  I bought three shoes form Jambu I N the same size and a somewhat similar style and not one fit the same.  This one was gigantic.  Although I liked the look of the other shoes, I thought this one looked cheap.  I consider myself somewhat of an expert on vegan shoes and is one looked like plastic. Sad because I hoped it would be my favorite.i had heard good things about these shoes and with my troubled feet and active lifestyle I need all the help I can get."
Product was not true to size and seemed different than similar items purchased in the past. My daughter was unable to wear them and I had to go out and buy some from old navy.
"I guess you are not supposed to let this touch the water. I bought this to wear with my swimsuit for the pool parties in Vegas and within the first time I wore it, and I didn't even submerge in the water, the gold part turned kind of a grayish green. Poor quality!"
"As soon as I opened the box, I noticed pinkish glue or something around the toes.  I would think shoes that cost over $100.00 shouldn't have that issue.  Also, they were difficult to put on and once I did, they put my feet to sleep.  If you buy these, I would recommend getting one size larger.  When I first put them on, I thought ""hey, these feel good"", but then I noticed a tingly feeling in my feet and then, they feel asleep.  I don't know if it matters to you, but they are made in China.  I would not recommend these shoes."
this is very small for a charm bracelet rather than a necklace. I have not even worn it. Never again would I order this
Huge was ok but the ends were not as big. Did not work with my glasses. Returned them.
"The neck less part was too long! I didn't like that, so Return..."
"This is so ugly, the material is super cheap and the logs is super think. It looks cute in pics but it's not!"
Expected a fitted waist and better quality for the price but had to give it away because it was just like a regular tank top. I bought same size for other brand and it worked wonders.
"I really wanted to like this jacket, but it arrived poorly shipped in a plastic bag, the top of the bag was open and the adhesive was attached to the jacket itself leaving residue and plastic attached to the jacket, luckily I was able to get it off, just disappointed..besides that the fit of this jacket is very awkard, the sleeves are very short and it's snug up top so if you move your arms the whole jacket moves due to the shortness of the sleeves and it's loose on the bottom, just a weird looking jacket, for refrence I'm 5""5 150 pounds the large fits fine but I could of ordered a medium, im going to keep it just to not deal with the hassel of returning it, i would not buy this item again or suggest it to a friend."
"Looks so cute in the picture but that's not what you get, awkward placement of the over lap on the arms, it's where a T shirt would start, and the pink is more of a baby (bright) pink"
I like the design of the watch. The one thing I would change is that there would be no Pulsar Logo were the 12:00 clock mark would be. Alas I will have to return it because I am unable to set the analog part of the watch. The minute and the hour hands don't move correctly. So I am unable to set the time in analog mode.
I've had this a week and is coming apart.
moves around
Yea... Its a nice fabric but itsjust to puffy and isn't very complimenting... Its like a old 90s rap video jacket in size tbh
"The pants seem snug in the legs. I have other pants from this company and they fit better. More leg room. I still can not find the quality and fit of the Botony 500 pants I use to purchase from Blair. My weight fluctuates do to a medical condition and I need more and less room with pants. Sometimes these types will feel to loose, other times to tight. The pleated are wearable the flat front are much to tight. Buy a size or two larger if you have larger athletic thighs."
"Too small. Im 5'7 and got a medium and couldn't snap the bottoms. Im about 135-140 lbs.

I received this product at a discounted rate for an unbiased rate."
"Definitely not heavy duty. It has been used less than a dozen times and two of the joints are already breaking. If it had been within the return period, it would definitively be going back."
"Wasn't even close to containing my top. This runs way small, and you can't return it because shipping costs are too much (supposedly). Instead of getting a refund, I was given a 30% discount and told to give the bathing suit to  a friend. I told them they need to change how they list the sizes and call this juniors, because it is not women's. TOOOOOO small. Even the large is for very petite people."
Hated it. Way too big. I'm being generous by giving it 2 stars
One word.... Glitter.
"Much much too small. I'd had a swimsuit like this in the past and absolutely loved it for hiding my love handles/ stomach area while still looking super cute. Even if this was the right size, the bottoms didn't cover enough to disguise my stomach area- I'd like it if they came up a little bit higher before switching over to just the net material."
"Do not purchase these boots, the sole transfers a uncomfortable lump feeling to the pad of your foot. These boots are very nice in every other way but the uncomfortable lump feeling is a deal breaker, going to try another model."
the shirt it a little big so order your true size.
"Huge, and cheap material."
"Bad design, since it does not have a rear adjustable strap, yet has specific humps for toes. So, you can't adjust the position of your foot forward/backward. That means that unless your foot is EXACTLY the right size, these won't fit!"
It stayed on for about 10 minutes then popped off.
"I had these shoes bookmarked for two months before splurging, so I was disappointed to find that they didn't meet my expectations on several fronts.

1. proportion - there's something wrong with the scale of these shoes from a design standpoint. They're just bigger and clunkier than any photo reveals. This is magnified once they're on the feet. I have a closet full of chunky shoes, but these just make me feel like a clown. Not funny.

2. fit - I have wide feet, but there was too much space on the sides for a secure fit; consequently, my ankles buckle constantly.

3. weight - for a ""foot friendly"" shoe, these are far too heavy to be of any significant benefit.

4. hard to put on, take off - admittedly, I'm impatient when it comes to donning shoes. I want to be able to slip them on, buckle and go. But these require me to sit and wiggle my feet into what is actually a pretty narrow passage way more reminiscent of a boot than a sandal.

In sum, these shoes are an example of something that looks better on the rack than on the feet. I can't recommend them; I can't even manage to resell them, sigh."
"I have purchased Easy Spirit shoes, boots and sandals for many years. This boot feels like molded hard plastic. There is no toe box. The color is nice but that is all. This item is not for me."
Not the material I was hoping for!
Beautiful design and color. But I never wore it because the material and construction were so cheap.
"Not adjustable and NOT for women with large breasts.  Band is very wide, so if you're kind of short in your abdominal area, its just too long.  Returned product."
Very restrictive and does not fit.
"Color does not match the outfit for which they were ordered. Shoes looked very cheap, were not made well, and even though I ordered a bigger size, they were still a bit small.  One heel is off center and hangs off the side of the shoe, and for this reason I have to give them this rating.  However, customer services for this company has been very kind and helpful in allowing me to choose a handbag to replace the shoes.  For this reason, I rate my experience with the company as """"."
i received 1 shoe a 10 and the other an 8
"I wanted these to replace another pair of ugg looking boots I previously had. I ordered these since these are a good looking version of uggs boots. Oddly, I had tried these in the store the day prior to receiving these and I regret not purchasing that pair now. The pair I received seem wore on the suede. The reason why I think this is a pair of display boots is because the suede seem wore but looks though someone attempted to clean the suede with some type of liquid. For those that are familiar with wetting/rubbing suede the color will turn darker and suede fabric will fray. Also the edges of the seam seem banged up.
Without a doubt, these are going back."
"I ordered the Black on Black pair of ZEM shoes in an xxs, which is the equivalent to a size 6 in womens. My feet fit inside the shoes fine, but after just ten minutes of walking around the unfinished seams inside the shoe began to dig painfully into the sides and bottoms of my feet. I really, really wanted to give them a chance. Who doesn't want ninja shoes? Unfortunately the concept is much better than the execution. The stitching inside presses painfully into all of the wrong parts of my tiny, slim feet in a way I'd have never imagined. After taking them off I had severe red lines on the soles of my feet for over an hour.

Oh, and they sent me a pair with silver stripes. Ew. That is not what I ordered. I'm submitting a return request pronto."
If I could give a negative # review I would.  These are just way too small and I don't think they would even fit in my Chihuahuas' head .  I did not even try to put it on.  NO RETURN policy either and I won't even push Amazon for it.  This is just a write off.
"I wear a Miss 12 skirt.  I would tell from the picture that it runs small, So I ordered a 14.  The 14 fit like a 10.  So I sent it back and ordered a 1X.  I should have ordered a 2 or 3X.  This skirt is way too small for someone that even had the slightest bit of hit.  I cannot recommend this skirt to anyone."
I did not like this dress. It was to small for me soI had to gI've it to my sister. it is not made of a stretchy material so you have to make sure that you buy the right size. it is not a one size fits all dress.
I seriously didn't notice any difference in my butt at all and I definitely have a butt that could use improvement.
"I just love this ring & I would have given a 5 star but, after having it for only a week or so the one little diamond stones fell out :("
DO NOT GET THE RED ONE.  It is like the Liberty Bell dressed up as Feddy Kruger for Halloween.  Just awful.  Maybe some of the other colors are better.
"For some reason, they slouch down inside my shoes every time I wear them, as though my calves are embarrassed of them and are trying to hide his face."
hand made but too large on crown so needed to fold under-will not shrink down-took FOREVER to come in mail-prollycuz hand knitted in china after you ordr
Very cheap looking even for the price. Returned it.
looks cheaply made...felt that way too..i returned them
Not fitting to the leg
"The gathered detailing at the bust looks strangely lopsided like the center of the bunch is shifted too far to one side, and the waist seam falls in an awkward place on my 5'1"" mom. It's like whoever measured the torso couldn't decide whether it should be an empire or an A-line. The material feels like the stiff, slightly sandpaper-y stuff that Halloween costumes are made out of, and given the quality of the stitching, I'm afraid of washing it even once since it might fall apart. I bought it for a wedding, but it really does remind me too much of a cheap Halloween costume."
"Earrings re very, very small. Not for an adult."
"Deceptive. The case is not stainless steel, but film covered plastic. I have been sold on Casio, but the item description for this watch is misleading (actually, downright dishonest). I'm returning my order. I don't appreciate being deceived."
I love the print . However cut is too small at the waist for me.
I bought it in October and it is already in horrible shape. I would give it zero stars if I could. Its scratched and the metal is peeling off of it. I work in an office so there is no rough use of it. Im so annoyed it is I such bad shape I cant wear it anymore.
"Terrible.  I wear a woman's size Large glove and these are too big.  The fingers are a strange boxy shape and the gloves are a flat design, so the fit is terrible.  Don't waste your money!"
"Love the look and color of the shoe, but they were so big across the top that they wouldn't stay on my feet. Too bad. Vaneli's used to be a perfect fit for me, but not so much anymore."
Pretty necklace but the smell is overpowering. I washed it several times trying to decrease some of the smell but it didn't help. I love the smell of leather but this is not it...
Quality was not good I feel I'm stuck with them
not great small and uncomfortable
They are not high waist as advertised
picture is very deceiving...total trash. very dismayed
"Purchase these for my 13 month old daughter. Very cute shoe, but returned because the sole of the boot is made out of some sort of foam material (much like a firm flip flop sandal). The bottom also had a odd felt like material on most of it. A bit slippery for a novice walker and for laminate flooring. Now I understand why the price was so low. Would not recommend if you are looking for a sturdy bottomed winter boot. I would expect more form the OshKosh brand."
"The support of these shoes is great.  However, they do squeak a little when you walk which is kinda annoying.  But my REAL issue is that the rose gold part seems to be flaking off and I've not had these shoes for two months!  Super disappointed.  Definitely will not look nice enough to wear as ""dress shoes"" soon.  Thought at the price I'd get better quality than this."
Cheap made. The wire comes out all of them the second time worn. Not a quality bra for real women
"These look cumfy but they were not, also too narrow, if you have a wide foot these won't work for you"
"Liked the color they fit but inside the left the material on top had a gold in it. The company would honor their product Hasbro had purchased in Sept and did not discover the problem till Jan as I was laid up. Amazon honor things they are great. I have great deal of confidence in Amazon, and will make any purchases with them."
didn't like this shirt. thin materials and showed all the curves and bumps underneath that I was trying to mask with the tunic! :)
"the boot is too tall and comes to my mid knee area, causing rubbing behind the knee when I walk.  Scrunches at the ankle."
First off I ordered a size 3xl and it fits like a small large or even a medium. The fabric is very see through. Overall not very happy with it
"Way too small, and I have thin feet. Toes pinch, the heel digs in. If you buy, definitely size up. They are very cute, but sizing seems pretty off."
The dress is very pretty. Come mid thigh. If you is bottom heavy. IT'S REALLY NOT FOR US. the dress rise every time you walk. It fit very tight. Not much breathing room..not true to size have to go up a size or 2. 5 stars far as the dress and material 1 star far as fit
I was expecting a color wine scrub but the one I received was rather purple. I am not very pleased by the color
Shrank a ton when washed a couple times so they ended up in the goodwill bag
"This is a bad imitation of the item shown in the picture, made of the poorest quality and worst fabric I have ever seen. Just trying it on it falls apart. It is almost impossible that it fits as per Western standards because it makes breasts look completely flat even if ordering 2 or 3 sizes up your current US size. Customer service zero. Contacted them, they offered replacement or refund but nothing happened. Don't waste your money."
Shoe not  true to size. Went on vacation hopefully I can send them back. She wears a 3.5. If I had know would have gotten size bigger. Oh well
"Too heavy, I feel like you need to wear a push-up bra with these because they are little heavy."
"really low quality material for this shirt I was expecting something way better for the price and the Nike brand although I'm doubting if it's actually legit. The Nike logo isn't reflective neither the ""Dri-Fit"" something I found weird because if you look closely to the other shirts they say NikeFit. My chest is quite visble with this tshirt something that I'm not a fan though and I used and sweated it and it doesn't dry as my other Nike or whatever other sport brand tshirt. Sadly I'm not in the US otherwise I'd ask for a refund.

This review isn't biased. Nobody is paying to talk about the crappy product I bought is just a customer's opinion about a con over a ""Nike"" shirt. Sad

Here are some pictures of the product."
Arrived with slight discolouration and a strong metallic smell. The stone looks like something from a child's toy. Haven't worn them yet but they look like they'll break after a few uses. Not recommended
"Wore them for a roller derby bout so I had on knee pads. After the bout the spot where my knee pads were, the color was gone. The sweat and friction of my knee pads rubbed off the color."
"just ordinary quality.
Used it once and the zipper is stuck."
The color was more of an orange color.  I liked the size but not the color.  Sent it back.
"I purchased the Clark's Springer sandals two years ago and wore them just a few times. I took them out last October to wear them again and when I lifted them out of the box, I found a black, oily feeling grit all over my hands. The soles of both shoes were disintegrating in my hands. I set them aside to see what would happen and just checked again today. The leather tops are in new condition, but the soles have completely crumbled into a huge tar-like mess. With quality like this I won't be taking any more chances on buying Clark's shoes. I hope to find out what the soles were made of, obviously some petroleum product, and avoid them like the plague.

I have other shoes by Clark's which have stood up well, and since I'm very easy on shoes, I hope to wear them for many years.  I hope this model proves to be a fluke, but with the cost of shoes today, I hesitate to take the chance of buying them unless I can examine them in person before I make the purchase."
Run very narrow . My daughter doesn't have a wide foot  and this shoe is too narrow on the top and the sides. The sole is also not memory foam like other Stride Rite shoes and not as soft to walk on
Totally mis-marked.  Beware. Not the usual Vans sizes. Maybe fake Vans
Stone fell out within the first month.
"Selling and Listing Seiko watches as New Calendar year watches when in fact OVER TEN YEARS OLD MODELS
I had concerns about the watch and called Seiko @ 201-529-5730 (Twice two different reps.) with this watch vin number and model number and was told ""this was made June 2004""!!!! And the model was discontinued in October 2005 buy both members of Seiko !!!! I filed a complete with Amazon less than five minutes ago. This is outrageous, misleading and makes me so upset as a buy of Amazon with over 225 orders placed this year alone. One of the few times I feel as if I was taken for a ride."
"I did not keep this hat. It is definitely packable and rather cute. It came rolled up like a sausage but with some time, the roll markings and wrinkles came out of the straw part of it. That lightweight sash, though, was wrinkled and cheap looking. There are too many nice looking hats available to settle on this one."
"I like the look, but they have to be mislabeled. They are at least a whole size too small. Very short. I bought size 6-1/2 and I could not even put them onto my feet. I bought 4 other similar styles of Vionics (6-1/2) and they fit awesome. Disappointing."
"Beautiful watch but it doesn't keep time - I've had to replace battery half a dozen times already...,"
"I ordered the same as the brown set but they fit completely different.  I still love the style, the brand.  Great seller.  Excellent service"
Green looks much lighter than pictured. Dress looks very cheap and flimsy.
I just received today and it does not look like the picture at all.  It looks like 2 halves glued together - one side is blue and the other green.  Glad I didn't pay much !!  Cheap
As soon as I put my makeup in the bag I picked it up by the handles to set it down and one of the handles popped right off.
came with a dead battery
I had to return these because the fit was much larger than the other Kanu shorts. Too bad as I thought the pattern was cute.
"Thin, cheap material.  Plus very, very small.....does not run true to size...."
Dont buy this! Flimsy.
"Very small, pay attention to oriental sizes"
Love the jacket but the hood is WAY TOO SMALL! I don't think it would even fit on an infants head. What is up with that?
"The dress was really pretty and decent quality for the price but it was HUGE. I am 5'2"" and about 100 lbs. I ordered the extra small but it looked like a moo-moo on me."
Junk. The chain broke the first wear. I want  my money back and I plan to return.
The image the on the items shows that the earrings drop past the earlobe while in reality they are meant for a 9 year old little girl. Not a grown woman.
"I took a chance on getting this and sadly it didn't work out.  the sleeves under the shoulder ruffle were too long and just looked awkward.  the sizing I got, large, was too large and looked more like a tent on me.  I'd look at sizing down when you purchase and make sure you are going to be ok with the ruffle across PLUS the little sleeves"
its so small am despondent
shoes that I received does not match the photo
No give and they were too small despite buying the right size. One wash and they look like they are for a doll size. Had to eventually throw them away because she would just throw them on the floor after trying to put them on.
"its skin tight, it adjust to your body. So if you have a little belly, or even a big belly. it will pop out."
Design was changed. Toe box is narrow. I walked around with them on indoors to test them out and I got a severe blood blister (below bunion bone where the mesh and sole meet). I'm thinking this pair may have been defective or the design was changed.  I returned and went back to Brooks! Disappointed Saucony! Seller was great to work with and is notifing Saycony to investigate the shoes. I give the Seller 5 stars for understanding and concerned! Thank you!
I love Melissa shoes and have two different pairs (flip flops and wedges). I wanted a pair of flats and loved these. However when they came they were huge. I usually wear a size 8 in Melissa shoes but these were so big that it was like I was wearing a size 10. They are cute but I returned them and choose a different flat.
"I really liked the design of these new Doc Martin Boots, but I was sadly mistaken when I received the boots and discovered their low quality.  The leather was a kind of distressed leather, not a strong new leather that would break-in and age well over time.

It is clear to me now that new Doc Martins, although hiply designed for casual wear, are not the same quality as their name formerly stood for."
It was broken when we took it out of the package.
"Somehow these bracelets make me itchy. I don't like them, not cute at all."
I ordered a size 8 and received a size 10 and it is a little snug around the waist. The color is pretty but the material is more nylon and had a few pulls. Not a quality product. Don't waste your money.
"These jeans are cut way to low to be classified as ""classic fit""."
I sent it back and bought a thicker one
Wore mine twice doing non-athletic things and it snapped while I was out in public. The fit was nice while it lasted I guess.
"I really hated it. I think I won't even use it. The stone is so dark that it looks black. I was really decieved, i expected a lot and have purchased earrings to go with it. I use just the earrings."
Returned  size 10 too small + narrow cut.
It's an ok shoe except I can't keep it on my foot.  My foot slides out.  Could be my foot so I gave it a star I normally wouldn't have.
"I didn't like these at all. The rubber toe looks cheesy and they were huge. I am a true 6.5 but ordered the 7 because whole sizes only and some reviews said they were small. Not mine, clown shoes."
a very low-quality material that looks terrible in person...I bought it to wear to a wedding and laughed at how ugly it was when I received it...went to Nordstroms the same day and bought a silk bow-tie there and received a ton of compliments on how great it looked...meanwhile this joke sits unused...
"worked but very cheaply made,  there are 3 screws that come with it and 2 fell out and ii was able to just push them back in as if they were too small for the holes"
"I ordered these slippers because they were so pretty. But once I started wearing them for a while the slipper would not stay stright on my foot.  This is the only shoe or slipper that has every done this to me.
I would not recommend them."
i decided to try these because they were cheap i saw reviews saying they ran small so i ordered a bigger size but they were still kind of small and within a few months every pair started falling apart
Had to purchase another 1 locally for my daughter to use because it took way longer to get to me... but it had the perfect fit fie her small hands
"29 inch spinner has a seam that is seperated about 2 inches at the top. Very poor quality control. Then you have to use American Tourister for warranty repairs. The suitcase has not been used and of course cannot be in this condition. Be smart, buy something else!"
"If there's a bust equivalent of a muffin top, this is how it looked. It was about two cup sizes too small. I've been professionally sized and fitted recently, so I'm positive of my band/cup size. This was not it, not even close, which was disappointing because otherwise this bra is gorgeous. Lovely fabric, strong clasp, comfy straps and band. All very high quality. Unfortunately this is the largest cup available so I had to return it. I would have bought several for everyday wear had it fit true to size."
I ordered a wide and the shoe is still too narrow.
"Cute cap, Most of the negative reviews are correct in that it's not full on the skull. It's flatter than usual which gives the feel and look that the cap is small.  I'll wear it in the summer when there is absolutely no wind, but would never order another one of these caps again.  It's not garbage worthy, but my other caps look so much better on me."
"Fit was nice but the straps on 2 out of 4 of the tank tops broke within a month of use. Given the price, I wasn't expecting a lot but I was hoping they'd last more than a few weeks. Will not be purchasing these tanks again."
"Their socks wear out extremely fast and their ""warranty"" won't replace them and their customer service is horrid."
"The picture is much better looking than the actual product. I bought it for my husband, but was very disappointed in it when it came. It seems very...childish, I guess. It looks like something I would have liked when I was little, not realizing how bad the quality is. I will definitely not be giving this ring to him for Christmas."
Very thin material similar to rayon. I don't like it .
"I gave this only two stars because I can't fit my ass in the bottoms without it smooshing my butt checks and making it look weird. The top is cute, but I wear a small b cup, and it's a very true b with no potential for ""pushup"" like it said. I may still use the top with another bottom tho. I ordered the small"
"I like the skirt very much, but it does run small.  I can fit into it bc it stretches, but the material is thin (more of a spring/summer material) so it doesnt look great.  I would go up 2 sizes if you are large across the hips, stomach or butt.  length is great though and washes very nicely."
This shoe is terrible!! Looks like a clown shoe on. Very Wide and sloppy! Had to return!!!
"I have a wide foot, these shoes are not good for that."
These jeans feel like they are one size smaller than the one I ordered. I won't buy again.
poor quality very thin cant retun washed but never wore
"Firstly, it arrived broken (missing a finger). Second, the bottom was uneven so when you placed it down on a flat surface it rocked back and forth. So much that it actually caused my jewelry to fall all over the floor if I touched it slightly. Not worth it at all, very cheaply made."
"Not return to buy anymore , neither would recommend"
Not supportive for women in C or D cups
Cheap cheap cheap material. Returned it.
smelled of poorly tanned leather. cell phone doesn't fit .
"they are durable and of good quality but heavier and stiffer than any other new balance I've ever owned and I love new balance... if you are looking for longevity out of them and don't plan to do much running then they might be what you are looking for, but I often go running and wear low/cut socks and due to the weight and design I have gotten blisters on both my feet and Achilles. New Balance makes a ton of great products, just that this one wasn't for me."
"These are very, very small. They are clearly made with child size women in mind. I will be giving this to my 11 year old for xmas."
"The Seiko box was damaged as if someone dropped it multiple times. When I opened the box, the watch looked like it was used. Scratches behind the watcc, on the band itself, and the second hand doesn't even work. I really hope I get a replacement or a refund because this was absolutely disappointing and it was supposed to be a birthday gift."
RETURNED TO VENDOR.  Veil came with comb broken off.  Very poorly made.
I don't know what kind of glasses people use but this cases are Way too small for any of my Ray-Ban sun glasses. It's not even 2x3 inches.
Don't like it at all. It don't fit. Disappointed!
"Bad quality, does not state child medium, gloves have no underneath as pictured exposing hand... needless to say I'm very unhappy...."
Lets just say Im glad I didn't order it in white... the hood is like a triangle and super thin.  Disappointed
"Listen to the other reviews, this thing is HUGE and HEAVY. I got this for my boyfriend for an upcoming trip and I'm returning it. It's too big to be practical. But I have to say the leather is nice and it's very well made, I'm sure it would protect watches amazingly. So, if you don't mind the bulk go for it. But definitely not practical for my boyfriend."
"This was a disappointing purchase. The ring fits fine, but it doesn't really look like it does in the Amazon image. The blue features are hardly visible and not as bright as they appear in the image. For $2.99 (plus about twice that for S&H) it's tough to get upset, but there is no way I would ever pay the list price of $49.99 for this ring and so it's wasn't really the deal it appeared to be. It supposed to be titanium but has no heft. Not worth returning but I doubt I'll be wearing this."
These are cute...but the price makes me give them a 3 star...they look like $5 drug store shoes. I am keeping them though becuase they are cute and I just won't think about how much I paid for them!
"I really like the look and the fit of these sandals. I go them for general wear and nature walks. The problem I have with them is that the part on the toe are where the strap goes through the little slot thing and connects it to the toe support, gives me a bad blister. It would be better if they had a small piece of material covering this hinge area. I can wear them for a little while but then that area starts to hurt. Shame."
Ordered to gift to a newborn and these hats are the same size as my husbands men's beanies and it fits his head easily.  NO WAY these will ever fit a baby.
this ring is absolutely not durable whatsoever. idk what these other people are thinking saying it's so unique and wonderful..this looks like it came out of a 25 cent machine or a sewer. the paint chips off and it is not shiny like the picture. titanium my ass.
"Very cute sandals and fit well. BUT my daughter only wore them 3 or 4 times before they broke. Tried to duct tape them to get her through kindergarten but it wouldnt hold. Cheap quality, will not purchase shoes from this supplier again. Returning to get my money back for sure."
See through and cheap material. Will be returning it.
"This is the most uncomfortable bra I have ever put on
And being 60 yrs old, I have worn a few ."
"it was way too small for me, the color was nice but slightly darker than in the picture."
"This dress does not look like expected. Its weird because on pictures it looks good enough but in reality it doesn't, the print looks cheap. I haven't even used it yet :/ but i am outside the u.s. So returning it is not worth it. Don't get me wrong if u want a very very casual looking dress it is not bad. It is well made except for the neckline that is a tiny bit weird fitting."
"very poor quality fabric, cheaply made and doesnt fit or look good on. the bowtie is tiny, it should be for a small child, not for bigger sizes. im returning this item"
"These are not soft. If you're used to scratchy cheap t-shirts, this will be up your alley. Unfortunately, and I may be a little ballsy to say it, but this junk shouldn't be anywhere near your junk."
"While I ordered the size indicated by the measurement chart, this fit strangely -- too large in the bust but too small in the midriff. Even my husband couldn't get it to close. I returned it."
Nice looking shoe with an office friendly heel height.  The problem is that they run 1 to 1-1\2 sizes too small.
"These shoes arrived in a different box, in baggies, and had been worn! They don't even earn one star! "
"I bought this dress for my friend. She was not happy with it. This dress is weird and not worth the money. The size does not fit as normal, it was much too small. The fabric is stiff and cheap like a Halloween costume. She was very disappointed and I had to return it."
"Cheaply made, not much weight to it at all. Maybe I am used to my other bras with more fabric to them"
"very very tight.  The size 7 was ridiculously tight on my 7 year old son, but luckily my 4 year old girl will wear them.  The 4-7 I bought for my daughter are also ridiculously tight, but they took tags off, so Ill give those to an infant I suspect."
"Too large, but much shorter than pictured - I'm 5'7""."
Had to return these are they were not snug fitting.
"I was pretty excited to get this item to wear on a cruise but was extremely disappointed in what I received. The romper looks white maybe ivory at best but what I got looked like it had belonged to a life long smoker and was borderline yellow in color. I added pictures next to white fabric to show the difference but it doesn't do it justice. My husband asked if it was something my mother had given me from when she was young.... Some of the pictures show a lining which this one did not have and it felt super cheap. I tried it on and was even more disappointed in the fit. Considering I'm a whopping 5ft tall and I have a very short torso, the shorts skimmed the bottom of my butt. If you were any taller this would not be wearable. I got the xl because I am a 34dd and I have 44 in wide hips and Asian sizes are usually 2 sizes smaller. It was loose enough in the hips/butt/thigh area but I swam in the waist, the chest area was fine. I bought this knowing it wasn't going to be the best of quality and I probably could have made it work if the color wasn't so awful."
"These boots are beautiful. I purchased the cream color and they're very stylish. The boots are lined with Thinsulate and soft fabric and they're very comfortable to walk in. I purchased my normal size 8 and there's plenty of room for thick socks. The cool thing is the hidden zipper on the side; the laces are just for show. I have wider calves and these fit me well.

The problem with this particular pair of boots is they arrived PREVIOUSLY WORN! The loops for the laces of one boot have ripped off (see pics). They're flimsy ribbon, again, not meant to lace up the boot, only for show. The white tread on the bottom was gray. The tags had been pulled off and left in the box. The cardboard to hold the boots in shape had been pulled out and left in the box. The box was falling apart.

The thought of someone else's feet in the boots grossed me out! They are obviously a return and should've been labeled as ""Used/Damaged"" on the Amazon website instead of ""New"".

5 stars for the boot itself.
1 star for Seller's deception in labeling these as ""New"" when they're damaged and used."
"too large, very narrow. Not like the KEDS I used to buy."
"I didn't love the fit. It's not that it's too small. Rather, there is too much room in the abdomen and butt while the waist borders on tight. Just not a comfortable or flattering fit."
I thought these would be great but they were a little smaller than expected and so they still gave me a muffin top. They did not sit on my hips.
"These are not the Fit Flops I have bought for the last 8 years.  They are so narrow, my feet hang off both sides.  Very uncomfortable! What happened to the Fit Flops I Iove.  Won't be buying any more if this is how they are now making them.  I bought 4 different pairs and only one said Skinny, they were all skinny and too narrow for my feet.  All 4 pairs are being returned, very disappointed in these new style fit flops."
"Levi's have not been paying attention to quality control. I have always worn the 517s and loved the fit. When made in America, the fit was perfect.  Also lasted forever! My new  517s were made in south America. The fit sucks. Around the hips and crotch, the fit is weird. Baggy and looking strange. There are companies producing jeans here in America for around the same price as the Levi's. ( Google, madeinusa.org)  Levi's should be ashamed to ask for $42.00 for a pair of jeans made so poorly."
"I bought two of these because one had a better shipping schedule. The second pair are great. The first pair that took the longest to arrive broke beyond repair the very first time I wore them. I took a picture, but don't see an upload option on mobile. The clasp on the right shoe tore completely away as I was walking.
It's a shame. The other pair are great. Glad I still have those."
"It broke as soon as I picked it up from it's box.. Gave 3 away as Christmas gifts, they broke as well."
Color was trendy but not appropriate for my husband's age bracket.  Jeans were far longer than comparable pair of Nauticas that he loves.
"Instead of purple as the picture shows the socks were Navy blue. A hole was in one pair of socks:( I will never buy these again!

 Super Soft Warm Microfiber Fuzzy Knee High Polka... Booooooooooo!"
"It was too large , it's completely different size not worth it"
"These are horrible and worth more like $5 than the $20 I paid. Far too long, misshapen, and absurdly see through thin. Very low quality, worse than dollar store pajamas."
"I purchased these with the hopes that if I spent a little more money (on leather/brand name/practical work shoes) I could get more than 3 months out of a pair of shoes. It's been three months now and they have begun to wear out on the inside and separate on the outside. I should have just stuck with cheaper shoes that I don't mind replacing every 3 months. I am a full time server so any shoe that comes near me will get worn out, but I expected better from new balance than this. I WILL say that for the first two months, despite the psychological discomfort caused by their hideousness, they were the most comfortable work shoes I've had in years."
"No fly.  What? Fail.  These are supposed to be men's underwear.  Guess not. Having to undo britches like a little boy to take a whiz is ridiculous.  I bought these mostly to try out the material, so picked the less expensive version, but even the Walmart Fruit of the Looms have flies in them."
"I would love to give these a better review as they are good shoes, But after 2 months they are falling apart. There is a whole in the bottom on the inside and one of the rubber pieces on the bottom is starting to come off. I don't do anything strenuous in these shoes I got to work and sit at a desk all day come home and take them off. I expect shoes to last longer if I pay 50 dollars for them."
"I am 5' 2"" and 103 lbs, and the small was too small for me ( too short and too tight).  Really?!  Also, the NIB pair I received had two small holes in the right leg.  I bought from Amazon with free return shipping, so I sent them back for a (hopefully) undamaged pair size M.  I also didn't like that they were much thicker than other brands of long underwear I have purchased.  Although more expensive, I will stick with REI Smartwool next time."
Returned. Fit wasn't for me
This top was a huge disappointment.  It wasn't worth the time that it took to get to me or the money.  Its flimsy and doesnt fit right.  The top is worth $9.99-12.99 tops!  I returned it.
"Very cute and made to description, but cheap quality and poorly made. Broke after 1 day of wear, which made my daughter very sad for her bday"
"Can't wear it, is not a XXL,  waste of time and money."
gave them away - hard on the feet
"The sequins are cute and the fabric is nice but the fit is terrible and construction is iffy. The bottom hem stitching is crooked. The waist is really gappy and awkward fitting. I ordered a size 4 for my slender 6 year old that typically fits a 5 perfectly and sometimes a 6 if I want a little bit of growing room. I needed these to fit snugly right now for a costume and they are giant on her. My friends averaged size 4 year old would be swimming in them!!
I don't have time to order anything else so I'll have to have them altered to salvage them."
"These earrings were garbage, they don't actually look as shiny and as neat as the picture. I have a necklace that looks like the pictures of the earrings, and the earrings that arrive for nothing compared to what I actually thought I was purchasing. The little decorations were falling off of each of the feathers, and the cheap brassy dirty metal did not match the beautiful shiny necklace I had purchased. Don't waste your money!"
"Pink tin foil! No thanks! Could be cute for a little girl to use as ""dress up"" clothes for play. Very disappointed the description nor pictures mentioned the metallic pink tin foil all over the skirt :("
"Mine came with a chink in it, super fake feel. You get what your paying for in fairness"
runs very small. Dresse is beautiful
"Wish I could give negative stars. I purchased the shirt with mickey, but received a totally different shirt. Wtf"
Not the best quality. Sent back and got a different more quality brand
"they lasted 7 months and the sole started to separate. another month or two and its going to fall off probably. I put them through extreme conditions, but I think they should have lasted a little longer for the price they are. UPDATE: on my second pair (I got them because size 16 light boots are hard to find) I am going to lower my rating to one star. because in about a month the left boot started hurting my toe. by feeling with my hand down in the boot, I could feel a crinkle in the roof of the boot above my toes, and it was a hard wrinkle from the inner leather toe lining, it put an unbearable pressure/pain on my middle toe. I was able to cut it with a knife which collapsed the wrinkle. These boots go through wet stuff and they don't last. I will never buy another pair."
"These shoes were pretty disappointing for Dr. Scholl's brand.  They do look nice and seem like they would hold up well.  There were a couple of big problems, though.  They are really narrow.  I saw some of the reviews that said they're narrow and suggested that you size up, so I followed that suggestion.  However, they were still much too narrow.  I was even uncomfortable just sitting there without putting any weight on my feet, and I never have had to buy wide width shoes.  The other issue with them is that they really don't have much support.  I was hoping that Dr. Schools would make really supportive shoes since part of how they sell themselves is caring about foot health, but the shoes just had a very minimal arch support.

If you generally have to buy narrow sized shoes and are looking for something cute and casual with a nice, cushioned insole that doesn't necessarily provide much support, this may be a good option for you.  If you have average-wide feet and need support, you'll have better luck with something different."
"Setting is OK, but the CZs look like plastic.  The CZs are very very low grade."
Smaller than size said but nice clothing
"They are made well but are so big the whole claw like part hangs below my ear, looks bad"
I ended up returning this. I didn't like the material and it looked very cheap. I ended up returning it. I suppose it would have made a good beach bag.
Wrong size wrong color
"The product's image is incorrect, the item I got (Arctic color) doesn't have worn areas and overall seems in different color. Attaching the pictures so that everyone knows what they are actually buying.
I am super disappointed, really loved how it looked on the photo. This is not the cheapest product, so money wasted in vain.

P.S. So this is how you become the richest man on Earth."
Cheap looking shoe.
"Looks great and feels substantial but the edges are too sharp! If there was just some way to smooth the polished center links it could be perfect. But really the main complaint is, like other's have already written, one of the end links will not fit the watch case. It will slide in place tightly but the holes for the spring bar pin do not line up with the bracelet. After a very aggravating 30 minutes of trying to make it fit I gave up. Returning for refund."
"awkward size. like, too long to look cute. i gathered up the hem and made a knot on the side circa 1986 and it looks sorta cute w/ skinny jeans."
I did not like these earrings really
Bag  the leather is real then and I came damaged not worth the money
Much smaller than I thought it would be. Doesn't expand.
"I sent them back.  They feel cheap to me, and not very comfortable.  The traction lugs are so soft, I think they will wear or tear off in no time.  I like both my Vibrams and my Merrils better, both of which are minimalist running shoes as well.  People obviously seem to like these, but I don't see what the fuss is about.  Definitely not for everyone, and definitely not the highest quality shoe in terms of materials or design."
I don't really like the fit of the bottoms. They were off in the hip area for me. The material looked really washed out to me. I couldn't fit these and I got a small. I ended up giving it to my sister. So if you have wider hips then this would be the fit for you.
2 of the zippers broke within the 1st week.  Would not recommend this to anyone I meet.  Was hoping for better
i'm returning this shirt simply because of the way it fit.  it was super awkward looking.  i like my clothes kind of baggy but this tank took it to another level.  Not a fan of it.  The fabric was comfy though but that's about it.
"Really cute, my daughter loves it. But the shirt itself is VERY poor quality. Washed it once and it looks terrible."
"Good fit, but very baggy at the ankles! Wore them once, now they are snagged all over because I washed them! Do not buy these. Very expensive for an extremely poor product."
"These felt cheap, although they weren't inexpensive. I think ballet flats, in general, are hard to fit most feet. I have narrow feet and these didn't fit at all. I'll stick with my Tieks."
"There was a sewing defect in the back that made it so that it can't be untwisted.  I saw one at Sports Authority that did the same thing, so I think it wasn't just a one-off."
"Top part was too small,length was too long. I bought a different brand in medium that had a bit of spandex it fit much better. Sent this back."
Badly made. Does not fit like picture projects.
"Gorgeous but I'm far too top heavy for this. If you are bigger than a F cup- bypass. I only hate it because my girls won't fit in this, and I got a the biggest size, due to the reviews. I ended up giving it to my friend, SOMEONE had to get some use out of such a beautiful piece. I will only buy items like this that come in my Bra size or I can try on."
Okay glasses. They look okay on I think because my face is not round enough for size though my face is round. These  glasses also do not block the sun at all. They only work if the sun is not too bright.
IS ANYTHING MADE IN THE U.S. ANYMORE GET THE CHART CORRECT.
This runs VERY small. I ordered the 20/22 and it was no where near an average 20/22. I gave it to my friend who wears an 8/10 and it fits her perfectly.
It can't be worn as pants and is short for on my 5'7 frame.
This bra runs small and it does provide a bit of support. My confidence level isn't high regarding this staying in place for hours. Very pricy for what it is. My search for a good strapless bra continues.
"I bought these for my husband and they were too tight.  He always wears an XL and never deviates from that size.  These pants are an exception.  We both laughed when he tried them on because they fit like tights.  I sent them back for a refund and decided to go with a totally different brand.  Plus, they don't have pockets and that was a ""deal breaker"" for him.  I had multiple communications with the seller when I tried to return them.  I never did get a return authorization and I eventually got frustrated and gave up and gave the sweatpants to my father-in-law.  Live and learn......."
"I wear a 7 1/4 hat for military and this is rather small.  I was disappointed.
It also does not match the exact color as the standard issue one."
"I have worn these scrubs for years. On my most recent purchase, the quality felt worse.  The material is much slicker and doesn't look/feel as nice.  The petite length is also 3 inches or so longer than they used to be. I washed them hoping it was just them being brand new, but they came out the same.  I would have returned them if I hadn't washed them."
"The dimensions of this thing are way off. No quality control.

Updated Review:  I wore this thing once and the first time I tried zipping it up, the zipper broke.  The first time I tried tightening the hood, the string broke.  This jacket looks good. Too bad it is a piece of JUNK.  DO NOT BUY."
"Mortified! Pink everywhere! This suit in the bright pink color got pink all over my white cover up, and the white lounge chair cover at the hotel spa pool! Really? A bathing suit that's not colorfast after swimming? This is my 3rd La Blanca suit- 1st was in black and white and 2nd in teal- both of those were great! But not the pink color! How embarrassing to have walked around half the day in a white coverup streaked with pink and a pink outline of my suit left on the lounge chair. Buyer beware!"
"My foot size is 9 EE, but these boots do not come in wide sizes, so I ordered 9.5 D.  The boot was more like a 8.5 so I would suggest you order one size above what you need.  Otherwise, the construction looked good.  Can't comment on the wearing since I couldn't fit my foot in them!"
"Usually Amazon's reviewers are spot on, but I had trouble with these shoes.  I wanted a basic black slip on shoe, but I feel like these are unbalanced and I feel I wobble when I walk.  The back slips off my heel (yes, I have the right size), and they feel very unstable.  I've already donated them because I'm afraid I'm going to fall."
"I didn't even try it on. Wig looked good in package, but is all thick and matted on the bottom. I wanted to put it in braids for a costume, but I can't even do that! Then when I tried to contact the seller and a message popped up and there was a problem with the message, try back in 15 min. Go figure. I guess I'm just going to have to put in a dispute with my credit card Co. and get my money back that way."
Ordered a size large than I normally wear and the fit was too small and the shoes were returned.
Too fragile. Split between thumb and forefingers first wear. Fit is small.
"This ring was slightly loose on me, thin but attractive until the ring seam popped and the ring flew off out my car window. Needless to say I will never buy a ring from this maker again. Waste of money!"
"Had these sandals over two seasons of light use.  Then took an overseas trip, taking them as my only pair of sandals for light trail use.  The sole on one of the shoes came unglued, making it impossible to walk.  Avoid Teva!!!"
"I'm a big guy, so I ordered 46 x 32.  Holy crap, once I got them and put them on, it was like wearing two skirts sewn together.
They were huge.  The loose fit is obviously more for thin guys to have loose.
I threw them away and went and found Wrangler work khaki's in my size."
Socks started to pill.  Really disappointed given how much they cost.  Would not buy again even though they are great at odor control.
"I didn't like the material of this dress. It's ""costumish"". It reminds me of Halloween. I will be returning this."
These were HUGE looking when on your face and very poorly made.
Nothing like the picture.  The stone is almost black.  Definitely not like advertised.
"Wore these Clark sandals for 20+ years. LOVED THEM.
Sadly someone decided to change to change something that is working.
IF IT AIN'T BROKE - DON'T FIX IT!

Now they make the shoe with REALLY  uncomfortable groves in the pad
that pinch the bottom of your feet while you walk.

What were you THINKING?
You lost me as a customer.
ACK!
Now I have to go find another brand that cares about customer comfort.
So sad.
CLARK - Please return to your previous SUCCESSFUL design."
"The size is right, but the right shoe hurt my toe.. I won't be wearing them... Right shoe is defective"
"I didn't expect it to fit as the measurements for the largest size were juuuuust about mine, and it didn't. Sent it back with a refund. However, the overall quality of it wasn't too great. The white fabric was very see through and the fabric wasn't extremely comfortable. Can't exactly remember what it was but it almost felt like canvas. The skirt didn't fit, but if it had it would've been way too short for my liking. If you're a small person who doesn't care about all this, it'll be perfect for you. But for a more curvy girl like me it's not good."
It's a one time use
wide is definitely not a wide!
Im not liking it because i cant get it to talk or tell the right time and the battery always dies.  Not happy.
I sent this back because it was too small and it was very itchy.
These are horrible sports bras. So not hold you up in any way.
"Day 3 of use and already have a hole near the top drawstring...like the old adage goes  ""you get what you pay for"""
This shirt is so cute however it is super small and not meant for women with breast over an a cup. Part of the ruffle goes right across the middle of my breasts it looks ridiculous and it's very uncomfortable. I ordered it in the largest size after ordering the first one and it was still too small. It came from really far so it's not worth returning. Though I wish I could get a refund for this.
"Poor quality, it was suppose to be silver plated, but the silver layer fell off and peeled."
I am always a medium in bathingsuits but I swear they make there mediums SMALL. my butt doesn't even fit in the bottoms right and my boobs are too big for the top.
"not worth what I paid for it, looks and feels cheap."
"I was so excited to get this for Halloween, but the battery pack (of 4 AAs) lasted maybe 20 minutes.  quite disappointing"
Nothing like it was described
"As others have noted, the sizing on these shoes is way off. I have been wearing 10M for a long time and every other shoe in 10M, including other Rockports,  fit correctly.
There is no way these shoes are a 10M. They are entirely too tight as to barely being able to get them on my feet.
I am returning them for a refund.
They are very light shoes and appear to be well made, but can not recommend due to the size problem."
Wore it one time and before I even made it to my event the white ruffle part had come apart in several spots! Thank God we had safety pins. But overall I was not satisfied with the quality as I felt it was made cheap!
they were returned.
The sandal is cheaply made. Little to no support. Virtually no sole and buckels rub on the ankles causing blisters. Awful.
"The material is very thin and it looks very cheap, I didn't expect that from Gerber is they are suppose to be one of the better quality brands."
Don't buy.  Very cheap and band falls apart.
"This is extremely bulky down the front.  It was wonderfully warm, but it added 10 lbs to my figure."
Careful when choosing the size. It will shrink alot after washing. Loved the shirt before the wash not gotta lose a some weight fo it to fit again.
Size is way off. I guess dance shoes are sized differently.
"No support.......Wears like a 'Wrestling Shoes' - which I wore for years.

Now, I am a Power-Lifter -- A Big/Bulky man -- these shoes come...NOT as advertised.

GOOD...??  I am requesting a FULL REFUND ---  Please Assist!

JEFF STROHMAN  //  jstrohman@ec.rr.com"
"I was really looking forward to these. It is becoming increasingly difficult to find quality maternity panties that go OVER the belly. Unfortunately, these are nothing more than the tops of very inexpensive panty hose. The ""support band"" pictured under the belly is a variation in the material weave, but in no way is adequate to provide any actual support. There is not even a cotton panel in the crotch. These are more comfortable than the ""below belly"" panties, but are not worth spending more than $5."
"I choose the size according to the attached size charts, but when I received my purchase, the pocket showed a differente chart size."
"This is a very cute purse and I received many compliments on it. Unfortunately, the hasp that attaches the handle to the purse broke today. I had only carried it a month or so. I tend to keep purses for several years, but this one didn't  make the cut. I knew that it wasn't leather and didn't expect it to last 10 years, but I did expect it would last the summer."
"Returned, Wrong size"
These are narrow width although that is not indicated in the product description. They were okay in that regard but would have been better as regular width. I bought them for around the house (I have plantar fasciitis and need arch support) but they're too much like flipflops. One of them in particular made an awful farting noise with every step I took because of suction created between my foot and the shoe. Back they went!
Returned -- we were looking for something a little more substantial in terms of quality. Great price though and good looking.
"While the description stated ""leather"", I was really disappointed to find that none of this shoe is leather except for the dark pink ""spice"" panel.  All other parts are a faux leather that looks cheap.  Since the soles are also the faux leather fabric, they get dirty too fast and will not last walking on hard surfaces like the regular Robeez with the thicker suede bottoms.  Since you are basically buying fabric booties, they should not be priced like shoes!"
"Fits fine. Not as high-waisted as I expected, but it fits okay."
"i don't hate it, but i was disappointed it didn't come with a chain or better a leather band."
"I like the slippers, they fit well and they are cute.  The problem is that they are far from durable.  The soft bottom makes then fit for only very limited use.  Overall I think they would be worthy of 4 stars if they were $7, but they are certainly not worth $14."
"The buckle broke the second time my daughter wore them.  Although she loves the look, they are cheaply made."
"The watch was purchased from Warehouse Deals. It looks fine. However, it will not stay wound even when I am wearing it. I do not know if a new one will do the same.
I am returning the Warehouse Deals one and have ordered a new one. The watch is beautiful {it will have to be sized because the band is huge, but I expected that} I am hoping the new one will stay wound while I am wearing it! I have ordered a watch winder for overnight."
This watch was either scratched or had been worn by another person.  One side of the band was showing black thru the rose gold.  I have returned it for a refund.  I ordered another Citizen watch & the band had a protective covering on it so it couldn't be scratched.
"All this scrub top seems to do is make me look overly busty.  That is clearly an inappropriate look for a doctor, so I will never wear this top.  I would love to return it but my kiddos removed the labels.  What a waste of money.  Don't buy if you have a cup size any larger than B!"
Runs very small.  Gave it away.
Cool shirt but after two washes stitching is coming out. Disappointed
This is not a one size item I am large/ x-large and this does not fit at all the arms are too small and its really tight... I am so disappointed... what a waste.
nay
"The cut and look of this suit is cute, but the top was just awkward on me. It flattened me and offered no support. It was a return."
"I wish these fit. I'm definitely an XL, and these were listed as an L, so I knew they might be too small. They might be juniors size, but even for junior size they're not an XL, though they might pass for a junior L.  Do not get them if you are a woman and you want them to be baggy and loose and cool looking like in the photo. Because I'm a woman and I'm an XL, and for these to fit I would need a triple XL. No joke. Also the  material is like dollar store material, I don't think it's going to wear out anytime soon because it'll probably last through a nuclear blast, as it is 1000% polyester, rayon, or some sort of weird blend, yet somehow it is still a little see-through. Other than that they are super cute and I wish they did fit, because I would still keep them, weird material not withstanding."
they are already stretched out and they are not even worn every day. I am still in search of a sock that does't lose its stretch after only a few time of wear.
This did not work and was a waist of money. Hung up every time the second hand got to between 11 and 12
"Bought this as sort of gag gift (or maybe not - bachelorette party, her choice, right?) but I opted to just toss it in the trash. It looked NOTHING like the picture. Waste of money, waste of time. Do not buy this."
Smelled weird and I didn't like the color at all.. way more yellow then the picture
False advertisement! The g-string is not as pictured. The teddy runs really small. I ordered the next size up after reading the reviews thinking it would fit but to my disappointment it didnt.
"I had to get t.his delivered by a third party, cute but far to small and I do wear a 7 in all other shoes"
"For my taste, the fabric has a poor quality, is very rough and hot. I would have liked a good cotton cloth"
"Planning to return.  I ordered my normal size,but  the fit was awful."
"They fit great, but only got one use out of them. Wore them to a wedding. These pantyhose are very thin and not durable. They snagged and ended up in the trash at the end of the night. Not worth $16 in my opinion."
"Material is nice, like an antique crocheted lace tablecloth.  However, construction is poor, rolled hems are too wide, twisted and unfinished.  It's on the small side, I wear 20W.  I will use it this summer, but what I was so excited to receive is merely a ""meh""."
"These shoes appear more like a man's shoe with a heel added to the back. I have a hard time wearing them because of the color inconsistency.  Not as comfortable as I would have like becaue they are a little stiff, however once they are on they do stay on. I would not rebuy them."
"Very disappointed, i buy this three weeks ago and it's already broken (see pictures) I was very happy with the product but i do not expect this."
"No i got it broke im sending it back like these mfing """""" ppl jus don't care bout customers im pisted;(;(;("
Buy a size or two larger than you need.  The back edge of this kills your heel if it touch it in any way while walking.  I should have bought two sizes bigger to avoid that....these do not run true to size.  I would have returned them but had already worn them a whole 12 hours shift.  I would rather die than spend another 12 hour shift in them again!  They are cute but are UNCOMFORTABLE!
"I should of sized down, these shoes run large. On top of that the button isn't sewed on. It's placed in a hole in a shoe with a fastener type of medal, like the old time paper metal clips you would open and close. Yea my button fell out after ONE day of wear and when I tried to put it back in all it did was stab my foot and cause my foot to bleed."
"I have never been able to wear women's shoes. After reading a lot of feed back I decided to buy the next size up. These were very comfortable on the foot bed. That's the only thing comfortable about them. They don't fit the shape of my feet, they come to a point so to speak, not rounded as a foot is. They were so small I could only get them on after forcing them on. Extremely tight. Didn't come up high enough on the foot to stay on and my feet are squeezed out of then. There is little to no arch support. One seemed defective, making me think these are blems. The rivet was in the wrong place on one, and that one had a much smaller toe tunnel.

I'd give these a lower rating, but the foot bed was nice.

They are made for very narrow feet. Even ordering a size up, they didn't work and were much too long, but no larger in any other way.

Columbia unusually has high quality these slipped past quality control.

I'm still looking for a sandal similar to these for wider feet.  It tried on some Merrell Hollyleaf, they fit, but only because  They are neoprene. They are far more comfortable than these Keas. I have not decided what to do."
"Best pants I've ever owned. I caught them on sale, which made the deal even better. These specific pants (rinsed playa) are super comfortable, I also bought rigid grey, and although they were great, they weren't as comfortable.

-----

UPDATE: So 1.5 years later, the pants seem to have shrunk a little bit (they are both tighter and shorter). They also faded faster than other Levi's I have. These are of worse quality than the ones I bought in store, they're less comfortable and not as versatile. I'm starting to think maybe they're not authentic since my other Levi's are older and still look and feel better than these. These are also over-priced, being that I can find Levi's in store for 20 or 25 dollars. Now I don't like wearing these."
"I ordered this shoe and one other Nine West. I love their shoes and have had good luck for the most part.  Can't do these pointy toe crushers though. This is a beautiful shoe but I have a very average foot and I couldn't begin to think my toes would survive 5 minutes without screaming their protest.  I am disappointed in myself because I don't have it in me to torture my toes for the sake of a lovely shoe. Those of you who are not faint of heart will look fantastic in it, they are gorgeous."
Ugh that's all
Nice frame treble glass . scratch easily and I hated retiurning and get a new one with same result again and again
They run small and they are not slip resistant like they say they are you wil slide. Bought them for my work because I work in a kitchen they had me sliding around. I'll just wear them around the house or to run errands. They can fast packaged well and look like the picture.
"I really has to examine the shoe because it looked as if it has been worn, until I looked at the bottom.  I was not overly impressed."
This dress was very cheap and shine looking in person; I would not recommend someone buying this dress unless it was for a costume party.
"runs small. I do have wide shoulders but usually wear xs, dress fits but very tight and uncomfortable."
"I really don't know how they fit, I cant get the stink washed out of them. they smell like some one drenched them in diesel. and it does not come out, I hung them out in the rain to air out, I have washed them 4 times used everthing I can think of including baking soda and vinegar, nothing will take out the smell!1!!!!"
My SO did not like these they are not as described. He said it felt like his foot would fall out of them if he walked normally. I purchased a size 16 but it just wasn't a great fit. I do love Sanuk's women's flip flops for me though! We are returning these ASAP.
Very cute but soon as I opened package stone fell off. Will have to glue back together.
Much smaller than expected. My grandson (6 yrs old) loved it because of the turtles but way too small for books etc. for school. We only kept it because he liked it so much. He uses it to pack small toys for sleep overs.
"These are pretty, but not very functional.  The fingerless gloves that I have that actually go around each finger are much more user friendly.  These bag and hang, and are not useful when I'm on the computer.  They help keep my palms warm when I'm driving the cold car in the mornings, but I like to wear my fingerless gloves all day at work too, and these just aren't usable for this, so I don't use them, preferring to use other kinds."
Had to return it. Band broke after wearing it 3 times.
Not a bad shoe if fit was good. Size 2X wide was way to tight in toes. Suffered 3 days then bought a different brand.
"So far so good!  Very comfortable and half the price of other sandals I have purchased.  I will see how they hold up and post an update later on...
Review Update:  I purchased these sandals the beginning of August and initially loved them.  Very comfortable and held up well to almost daily use.  After about 8 weeks of use all of a sudden one area on the side of the shoe where the side of your heal is just came out of the rubber insole.  The glue just gave it up.  I read some reviews of this happening and hoped it wouldn't be the case, but it was...  Very disappointing because of how comfortable they are.  Wont be purchasing again...

***Update 12/2/16*** After contacting both the seller and Amazon regarding the side of the shoe coming unglued from the sole, neither was able to do anything because it was past the 30 day return limit.  I decided to contact the manufacturer's customer service by email and explain to them what happened.  I received a reply within 48 apologizing for what happened and offering to replace the sandals at no cost to me.  They asked for a couple of pictures and gave me a few options on replacement sandals.  I chose a different style and color and they were shipped out today.  The whole process took about a week.  Northside has wonderful customer service!!! I'm just waiting for my new, all expense paid sandals to arrive."
"Cheap quality, thin, do not wash well....poorly stitched..overall poor  and disappointing..not worth the money!!"
"Not realistic looking at all, and the foam head didn't look right at all. Definitely wouldn't recommend."
little too thin fabric
SOOOO misrepresented. These are sized for a very small Asian woman or a junior. Very irritating having to return things. Glad we have Prime.
"Seriously, this purchase is the final chance I am giving to a company which, once upon a time, made superb footwear.

I purchased three pairs of 1460s (which were then made in England) in my late teens and early twenties, all of which I beat the hell out of. One pair lasted me two years as a laborer for a plumbing outfit I... labored for. Not bad considering they aren't a true work boot. One pair lasted me five, FIVE, years in the food service industry. That's five years of walking miles and miles a day for fifty to sixty hours a week. Astonishing. The last pair, which were my casual go-to in the beginning of their life, finally gave up the ghost two years back after long ago being relegated to the miscellaneous handy man/painting/I-don't-care-what-happens-to-these spot. They were at least eight years old. Wow.

After Dr. Martens ceased large scale production in England, I have purchased three pairs, these Harlows being number three. The first pair took almost a month to break in, but once they were, they were really comfortable. Until the sole split down the middle after only having them for four months. Hmmm... Well, I chalked it up to a fluke, and order another pair shortly thereafter. This pair was sub-Walmart GARBAGE. The ""leather"" started cracking after five or six weeks of wear, and...whatever, they were trash. I held off for a few years and then I spied these while browsing. Price was okay, they looked like what I wanted, and here we are, about a month in. First impressions were good - the leather seemed a good deal thicker than the last two East Asian pairs I got, so I took no chances and Lexoled the bejesus out of them. After many doses of a good conditioner, they got ultra supple, and really formed to my foot, and, after the addition of an actual insole, they were like walking on air . They reminded me of the old pairs I had fifteen years ago. And they have a kinda pseudo-flannel lining which adds an extra bit of warmth, which is nice to have in Wisconsin. The stitching is sound, the soles seem solid yet flexible, the eyelets don't pop off while you're walking - they are a complete one-eighty from the last two pairs. If all goes well, I may look into buying another pair down the road. If not, sadly, then I'm done with a company which I once loved; a company that used to make a quality product.

My only twp gripes are a) the laces are a joke, so you best buy a decent pair to replace the ones that will break almost immediately, and b) for $130 list, I expect an insole. Not a super-dee-duper space age technology orthopedic wundersole, but something. ANYTHING. C'mon.

All in all, I'm very happy with them and I hope to remain so.

Edit: 12.20.14

Guys, you blew it.

After not even two months of casual, almost exclusively indoor wear, the stitching is coming undone at the heel and where the vamp meets the upper (which boggles my mind because it is triple-stitched - how is that even possible?). And I babied these things, man. They were kept clean, conditioned and waterproofed. I even used shoes trees in them several times a week. The only reason for two stars is that they are very comfortable, but that's not gonna matter once the stitching deteriorates, is it?

Well, I'll still wear them until the end, whenever that may be, but never again will I purchase another Dr. Martens product. I should've spent the extra thirty bucks and got that pair of Chippewas I was eyeing.

See ya, Doc."
CHEAP! they lost it in the mail. Had to request several times to reship. Wouldn't reship item to me unless I wrote a good review. Took months to get it and only wore like 2 times and then it turned green and nasty
"These are my second pair - the first pair had the floral inside, the new order did not.  The very first day I wore them I looked down and at the toe of the right shoe the leather-like material had torn.  So they didn't last very long."
"Extremely small. I can tell wrist band is not going to last, I have just had it for a week. I ordered this brand because I owned one previously which still works, but wrist band lasted 3 years & paint was coming off. Still there working but need probable to change the bands."
"Pros:
Watch face looks decent. Light up feature is cool.

Cons:
Band is flimsy. The chrome on the bezel looks and feels cheap. There is no weight to the watch so it feels weird coming from other timepieces. Oh, and the ticking drove me insane. I'd have music on and still hear it from across the room. Forced myself to wear it just incase I'd get used to the ticking. After a week I couldn't stand it anymore, and got rid of it.

I've purchased other watches in this price range, and this is the worst by far."
"I am very disappointed with the product, buy 2 and both arrived with the damaged glass.
And the clock in bad position.
The product is of very low quality, I do not recommend your buy it."
Much smaller than the size indicated. Weird fit.
Soft cotton but kind of floppy. The brim doesnt stay up and we constantly have to fold it up.
"Based on reviews I expected that this in a size 10 would fit my size 10.5 B(M) feet. (being tall unfortunately comes with big feet) Not so. I couldn't even get my foot in, let alone wear it. It was a perfect size 10... (or maybe a 9.75?) which is not what I expected. Returned for a very disappointed refund."
"Not sure if the type of t-shirt was changed after reading the other reviews on how soft this was.  The shirt was not soft at all.  Very rough and scratchy.  I am returning it.  The sizing seemed OK, running slightly large.  Would not recommend."
The top two thirds fits but it's so narrow at the bottom that it looks ridiculous to walk in.
These shoes are very very narrow especially around the part right below your toes I put them on and had to take them right back off I would not suggest these or buy these again
Do not hike in these! They were too big - I tried to hike in them using thick shocks. I tripped all over the place. They are not good shoes.
"Didn't survive the the fitting, not worth the money"
Shirt is too small. Only can use as an underlayer.
The slippers are BIG and fluffy.  Some people might actually like that.  I like a sleeker slipper.
"I bought these for the office and casual wear. they are decent quality, though the stitching is poor compared to loafers from before the outsourcing. they loog good, and fit well, but the man- made foot bed is very thin and creates sore feet very fast, the uppers are made from decent leather and the soles are good as well. If you buy these realizing you will need a pair of inserts in them, then you are fine."
"Love everything about these boots except that they are made for a yeti.  I'm a normal-sized person (5'8"" tall, wear a size 4-6 pants, size 8.5 shoe) and I have approximately 2"" of room in the leg of these boots.  I mistakenly kept them thinking that ""it's not so bad"" and ""maybe with jeans they're ok,"" but the truth is, it looks like I'm a little girl playing dress-up in mom's boots."
The fit is awful. The way the hat is made isn't even shaped like it would fit around anyone's head without bulging out in the front.
Horrible. Runs small and didn't even get to wear before they were destroyed by one wash (I wash everything before wearing). Do not recommend.
"Jacket is nice, but I did not receive a new one.  There were no tags on it, little wood shavings stuck to it, some of the fabric on the inside of the coat by the pockets was pilled, and there were wadded pieces of paper in the pockets."
I bought a pair of these in April.  I loved them. Then in November the soles split right across the entire middle.  Now I don't live them.  Hey Dr.? Make a better more durable sole and I'll buy them again.  Otherwise they aren't worth more then 20 bucks for summer use if you want to look cool.
"These tights are horrible, there is no elastic band on the top, so the tights will not stay on unless the bodysuit is holding them and the bodysuit is not tight enough to hold them in place. The feet on the tights are huge, horrible product."
too small had to return it.
I loved the shoe shape but I thought I had been sent a size 7 when it was actually a size 9.  I loved the other miz mooz shoes I got-- great style
"I am a true 10, ordered the 41, way too small-ordered up thinking they would be more comfortable, they were not.  I thought for the money, they would be like ""walking on clouds.""  Not so.  Little support.  Rough around the edges, literally.  Both pairs are being sent back.  I did give it 2 stars because of styling.  The red leather has a nice look, and that is about it.  I just didn't feel the need to go through the pain to ""break them in."""
"This is a beautiful necklace, which is the only reason I gave it two stars. The piece came broken in half. What a disappointment."
"I thought these looked good at first, or at least, on Amazon's website that is - prior to having purchased them. However, when they arrived, I had a much different opinion of them. They were so skinny - starting from the mid-sole to the end of the toe box, that they could've easily been mistaken for cowboy boots. If that's the fashion that you're looking for, then you'll probably like them; that is, if you can bear having to stand in them for 10 minutes or so, or if you are able to walk down a city block without stumbling or looking like you're inebriated as hell. I most certainly couldn't so I returned them. Sadly, I have purchased dozens of shoes from Amazon and these are the very first ones that I've ever returned."
"Very disappointed, the sole has a pattern which feels as if you are walking on thorns, I'm wearing it for last 7hrs in the hope that I might get use to them or the sole adjusts but all in vain, and now I'm having pain in my calf muscles, looks wise they are very Kool and classy but comfort level is worst and my bad I'm at the airport right now can't even return them, or I might ship them from my country but very disappointed with what I purchased for this price"
"Aggressive. Bulky. Looks good, from some distance. At closer look face looks like molded plastic with fake complications, tho chrono is real. Band is very stiff and case exit angle is uncomfortable.
This watch has many sharp edges. Some - by design, some - just should not be there.
Sleeve on crown extended good mm below bottom surface. Fist time I see such geometry on any watch! I guess it has to be proportional to the heft of the watch, but because movement sits very deep, crown end-up protruding below bottom plain. It cuts into flesh like torture spike. In two days I got bloody sore under crown. And bottom perimeter is not much better. all bottom edges sharp like a blade.

Supposedly rated to 200m. But these pushers feels too loose for that. Well, maybe they are. I will not test it."
I ordered desert sand but got khaki instead. Disappointed. Its a tad on the small side as well and so it rides up. It also has that horrible Dickie's red tag on the back. The desert sand color was not suppose to have that tag. I'll be returning it.
Very uncomfortable.  The insoles feel like I'm walking on boards.  If I keep them I need to get cushion insoles.  I like the design but when I got them I put them on to break them in and had to take them off after 30 minutes.
"I am giving this product 2 stars because although it looks as described, there is an overpowering chemical smell, like a plastic solvent, emanating from the material. I have a definite concern about how healthy this is to wear against the skin, which absorbs what it touches."
poor quality... don't buy
I guess you get what you pay for.  Large was rather small
"poor quality, very disappointed"
"Decent, but fabric isn't very comfortable and the fit is unusual.  I would not buy again."
"A bit large, thought this was going to be elegant, but it looks bad, like if it was a black curtain."
SUPER stiff and uncomfortable.
It lasted 7 days and the zipper broke.  7 days.
I bought this for a Christmas present for my niece. While I was wrapping it I noticed there was a hole in it. Sending it back.
These boxers are ok at best. The elastic band around the waist is as the boxers themselves so unless you around Lounging around in your pajamas they will slip off or bunch up. Not good to use for your workday. Only for afterwork post shower in sweats.
I wear a size 8 and I ordered a size 8 and they were to big
bottom rolls up when wearing so it makes it uncomfortable
The nail on the left said of the lens broke right away. Cheap. Dislike. I do not recommend this product.
Laundered these before use and what a mess. They came out of dryer waded and pleated. Had to iron every single one of them and the wrinkles still didn't come out. They aren't fit even to use as rags. I've bought better from Walmart. Do NOT recommend these at all!!!!!
"These are rather narrow, and they don't have much shock absorption in the sole. I returned them."
Too long and baggy.
"Very bad quality, it smelled awfully of chemicals and left color on my hands."
The gold started coming off after a few days.
"Metal grommets popped off the second i unwraped it, rectangle of reinforment near the handle attachment is now coming off, the leather badly glued to it is also coming off. sadly this is a really cute purse made VERY badly.
returning."
Couldn't even get my foot in them. I ordered a half size larger than normal and couldn't get them on. Returned for refund.
Terribly unsupportive. Like wearing a pair of old navy flip flops- and that's speculation because I wouldn't dare put my foot into a cheap flip flop.
Lovely but began to fall apart within two weeks both in the seams and the sole.
"Very cute, slip on, cushy sole. Love them.

Have to update my review. The small rubber like ""Skechers"" emblem on the outside of the heel has worn through to the inside of both shoes. It is hard and poking through, can't get it to flatten out. It has created a hole in each shoe and a big blister on my left heel that is very painful. Couldn't get them off fast enough and have had them for only 6 months. BUMMER!

Seems a little gorilla/duct tape on the inside keeps them comfy enough."
"Sole had potential but the plasticy hard ""leather"" around the toe produces blisters within a couple of minutes!"
"I don't see how this can hold 25 cards, even when broken-in.  about 5 seem to fit in each side without getting bent corners, frayed edges, etc."
"Im new to the Rachet belts.  At first it was great, very comfortable in the fact that you can adjust it to exactly how you want it to fit. But only after a few uses, the Rachet release got stuck. I was stuck in the belt and I had to cut myself out of it. It only lasted a month and it wasn't even used that much. I want my money back."
Weird fit and too long.
I found these shoes ran small I return then
"The first version was. Better !
Too stiff and I don't feel the massage function"
"I was really looking forward to getting these boots. When I tried them on they were about a size too big, not a huge issue I'd just return them for a smaller size. As I was taking a closer look I noticed that both boots had a problem with the stitching on the tongues. As the problem was with both boots and not the same area on both boots, (one had the left side and the other was on the right side of the tongue) I decided to ask for a refund as I had lost confidence in the quality of the product. I re-ordered from another source."
From the photos these looked like a pair of boots I wanted to own. Much to my chagrin when they arrived I was very disappointed. They are very poorly made. The boot is very thin and flimsy and has a hideous bulbous toe. I wore them once for about 5 minutes in my apartment. Then returned them immediately. If you are looking for a cheap ugly boot these are for you.
I was hopeful for a comfy bra at last but this did not deliver. I'm rather small-framed and would normally take a size 34 bra. The elastic was very uncomfortable around the midriff. I ended up taking it off the first day I wore it midday. I will not wear it again.
HURT MY SONS FEET TO SMALL FOR THE SIZE IT SAYS IT WAS
Too small too short did not fit the expectations neither the description. I don't know when am I going to understand not to buy Chinese products they just don't do it!
The quality of the leather is of poor quality.  The stitching on the bottom of the boots seem to coming loose.  Not the best quality
Runs very small. Crushingly tight fit. Disappointing
"If you wear a C-cup or up, this is not the shirt for you. Pushes your boobs down, down, down I didn't know they could go that far down. Couldn't take a full breath the entire day I was wearing it. It also started to fray as the day went on. I believe it really means it when it says one size fits some. Fit everywhere except the bust."
"I bought 2 pairs of different colors but same size.  One pair is much smaller than the other.  Neither pair is comfortable.  I have bought so many different brands of shoes online and not once did I have to return.  My feet are quite easy to please.  This particular style has a very odd fit, not comfortable at all:("
"Initial day I wore the shoes, they fit well.  After the 2nd day my ankle became sore and I was unable to continue to wear them.  I noticed after 3 days of not wearing them, my ankle was better.  Wore them again to make certain the shoes were the issue, and it turned out they were. My ankle became sore again.  I had to return them."
"I don't like the way the sweatshirt fits. It's short, doesn't hit the hips. It's also very boxy. If you are into this type of fit, ordering your normal size should be fine."
"So disappointed. I don't like writing negative reviews, and rarely do but this one, I have no qualms about. An adult small would fit a toddler, seriously it would!  The sizing is way off. The shirt itself was not well made at all. This was for a teenager.  The last thing I expected was a see-through cotton shirt.  Very cheaply made. Have to agree with many of the other reviews, the price you pay for this shirt is not worth it.  Paid $23.98 including shipping and handling for what I believed was a small adult sized shirt.  Would not recommend this one."
"IT'S LONG,  HARD TO UNBUTTON,"
Nice heavy material but fit was not flattering at all. Returned it.
"Foam shoe, terrible padding and sole-too thin and uneven, tight as ....can't wear socks, if so, must be thin as..."
I ordered a size down because the reviews said it runs big. Well that was too small I returned for the next size and that is still tight.
"This bra was built for young girls or Asian figures with high breasts. Also, I am a size ""B"" cup, always have been, but the cups on these are more C to D. The biggest problem was for a ""48B"", even with fully extended straps, the bottom of the bra was higher than the bottom of my breasts. To get the cups down the back was 3-4 inches raised, no way could I wear this. I have never had this problem with a bra purchased in a woman's size, so I guess this is just not styled for a plus sized woman's chest. It is pretty and well made, but the fit was simply not compatible, I had to return it."
I guess i ordered the wrong size im a size 14 and i think i was suppose to order a 12 but very stretchy
"I don't like the quality or the metal pin. It works if you throw it in your pocket, but as a nurse, we need a clip on."
"Fits well. Its padded...I didn't want that. The pads are not stable, they move around. Not for high impact support. I guess I will keep looking for a better sports bra."
"This pair isn't comfortable compared to my other Vionic sandals.  I love the way they look, but as soon as I slipped them on I knew I wouldn't be able to wear them.  I wish Vionic would use a consistent foot bed so one would be able to buy any pair knowing they would be the same as the other shoes we love.  Sad to say I have to send them back.  I also purchased the Vionic Shore Slide which have a cushiony foot bed.  I wish I could find out what other Vionic sandals have the same foot bet as the Shore Slide!"
"I ordered a pair of Laurel Burch socks about a year ago and LOVED them!! Still do!  They have endured the wear and tear marvelously!  I always got compliments on my socks of all things!  So in usual form, I loaded up on about 3 more pairs.  This one...my favorite because of the large dog picture...I wore only twice and ended up with a hole in the toe.  A big hole.  So now I am wary to buy any more.  I was very disappointed, and wish Miss Laurel would send me another pair to keep her conscience clear."
Shoes were nice quality and good deal but slipped off my feet. Would not stay on even if I laced them tighter.  Had to return them.
They are way higher and larger than on the model.
"As other reviewers have said, the bed of the shoe will turn the bottom of your foot black-  and you don't need to get them wet for it to happen.  It washes off, but still not a real selling point for me.  I'd suggest a pass on these."
I'm underwhelmed.  The cushioning in these shoes is a disappointment.  I'm on my feet all day and really needed something with comfy soles.  Honestly?  I like my $20 Kmart shoes better.  These shoes run wide.  (which gave me more room to add insoles.)
Very cute and the color (blue) was beautiful but there is ZERO support and that makes the suit look dumpy.
This is for women with small breasts; I thought it would be sufficient being extra large but it didn't even make it to the nipple.
"These aren't really ""padded"". Spend the extra on the Champion socks instead."
Defiantly not for women over a size 10
very good but poor quality sandals are from china I wear maybe two weeks and thats all  they turn to crap
The XL measures 28-30 stetched to the maximum.  Beatiful but unwearable for me.
I really liked these even though they were a little shorter than I usually like. I figured I would wear them around the house. I washed them on cold with woolite and now they are super short. I won't buy more of these
"Too small, looks are deceiving"
"Very disappointed.  These are NOT non-skid socks.  Kids will fall wearing these on ceramic/hard wood floors.  Also they are fluffy, so forget about being able to use them as regular socks.  Not worth paying postage to return, so I've just got to strike this purchase up as lesson learned.  Although the sock is cute, my advice  - don't purchase."
my ten and a half year old is slim and this is too big
I should have ordered small.  It runs a lot bigger.
"So disappointed that pilled by second use. These look like hand me downs.
The cheapo Hanes brand are holding up so much better. The French Toast brand's not to bad."
Cup too large not worth paying the price to try another size
horrible even for price. Do not buy
i am disappointed...this is garbage
"I love these pajamas, but I have now had two pairs sent to me with quality issues.  The first one had a nick cut into the band of the neckline trim and the second had the same thing plus a big hole in one of the pockets.  I am giving this company one last try because I really like the fabric and the style.  My fingers are crossed."
Very bad stuff stinks I am not satisfied with my purchase
"The sandals I received were not the ones shown in the picture.  The quality of the ones received were terrible.  Surprised they are Clarks,"
"My husband bought me these slipper for Christmas and I do work from home so these seemed perfect. About a month ago they had just lost all their cushion an had become terribly uncomfortable. So for $70 with shipping these slippers lasted me 6 1/2 months.

Because they were so comfortable I decided that instead of trying to find another similar pair I would re-order. I reordered a second pair for the same price $69.21, the same size 9 and the sole of the slipper on the last pair measures 10 inches, the sole of this pair (same size) measures 9 inches.  Made in CHINA!  i am getting tired of this stuff. There is no consistory and now I know I need to order USA products from here on out, if I can still find them.

I am so frustrated and I don't want anyone else to be so if you don't really wear a 9 they will fit you or you can order a 10 but I am sure they are going to be really big.  What is up with the USA anyway? So many people unemployed and we still have to get things from countries where there is cheap labor. NO WONDER.  If anyone knows of a site that does sell similar slippers that are made here in the states I would love if you would share it. Now I have to figure out how much it is going to cost me to send then back. I paid $4.98 to get them here and I will have to send them back with a return receipt Geez.

Sorry, End of rant.  Just don't get frustrated like I am today, I would not order these slippers again and have no clue as to the others they have on site. I need to check and see if they tell you where they are shipped from.  Good luck and happy shopping.

Maryellen"
Falls apart.  Most merrell shoes have been good.  This one is not.
"Would not recommend.  The front of the shirt is too short.  Not nearly as long as pictured.  I am 5'8"", and the front of the shirt sat just above my pant line."
"Wasn't too happy with these.  They are extremely thin and not warm.  When I tried to unbutton to put the mitten part over my hands one button hole was so small I couldn't get the button through it, it was kind of stuck shut so I had to rip the button off.  Not worth the money at all."
"Though it is a pretty necklace, I would not recommend this as in 2 days 3 stones have fallen out."
The first time i tried to set the watch the nob fell off and I had to return the watch.
I ordered these in size 0 and was swimming in these pants!
"As other reviewers stated, they changed the design and made the thong shorter. Now it just painfully rubbing my feet. I will return."
It is fake. And it is very bad. Don't buy it.
"While the fabric of these pjs is soft and lovely, it gives off so much lint/fluff that it's ALL OVER MY HOUSE and looks like they sort of exploded all over my bed sheets. I thought washing and drying them would help, and it did a little, but I am still littering my bed and house like a walking dandelion - it's ridiculous. Hopefully it will get better, but I'm disappointed by the crappy material, especially for the price. My much cheaper pjs from Target don't do this at all. :("
"Sleeves are really short, sizing is off - also weird that the zipper goes all the way to the top of the hood."
"They look cuter in the photo than they do in real life.  I was stationed overseas and these resemble the ones that Afghans wear so I feel like a creepy old man wearing them.  I bought them specifically to wear when taking my kids to their swimming lesson and I guess they work fine for that but it would be nicer to have been satisfied enough to wear them in public.  In addition, some reviews claim that they were a little wide and I buy crocs for my son because he also has wide feet.  These are not wide at all.  It completely slams my pinkie toe every step I take.  Overall, I would NOT buy these again, or in another color, or recommend."
This is not true to size. The width band is almost two inches smaller than what it actually says. I measured to verify. Very disappointed.
"Ordered size 12 W but one foot always seemed tight, I thought it was my foot until I checked my shoes today. I received 1 shoe (Left) of the correct size 1 your 2 W & 1 shoe (Right) of wrong size 12 M. Please be careful & check your shoes immediately post delivery to ensure you get what you ordered for."
Not for busty women in spite of size large bra.  Nor if you have regular ribcage but are buying to fit size D cup.  Material isn't for regular support just a comfort bra when lounging.
DO NOT BUY!! WORST PRODUCT EVER!! I can't begin to  describe the crap this is!! Totally agree with other reviews!!
"A size larger was recommended, but I will be returning it for a smaller size.  They are beautiful."
"This is a very comfortable material but does not give support whatsoever however it doesnt even bite the skin like some sports bra do but you forget you have them on and giving them somewhat of a hold. B and 1/2 here and my puppies were bouncing up and down and the pads in the bra gives an impression of the breasts being lumpy if I used the stairs. I liked wearing them without the pads for around the house. This is perfect for the person who have to get out of their bra after work asap then relax a bit and lounge around until bedtime. Pads does not cover the entire boob area. So useless in that part.

FYI the white bra did not survive the first ever wash it untraveled right at the seams"
I bought the shoes because of their adorable design. I normally wear similar shoes made by Toms. I ordered a larger  pair because of the reviews and found that with every step I took the shoes were extremely uncomfortable and very stiff I returned them right away
Cute but little color
Are not the same in description
"This is the worst umbrella i have ever owned.  I used it today and not only did it flip up in a slight wind, but it didn't open like it should.  I have owned umbrellas half this price that were better than this one.  I got soaked by the rain.  No protection from this umbrella at all."
Unfortunately they have nickle in them even though they are silver! So I can't wear them coz my ears swell & itch. I loved them & got lots of compliments. I ordered them coz it said no nickle
"I read all the warnings about size problems but i ordered anyway. I have worn size 11 mens for the last 10 years so i ordered a size 12 just to be safe. Unfortunately all the warnings were true. I couldn't even get my foot halfway in. Be warned, since this is a sizing problem you have to pay the return shipping. It is deducted from your refund."
"runs very small, I wanted them to fit kind of loose like joggers but they were so tight I just love that I.T says Brooklyn and thats I.T."
"Fatal , the clock herrumbro damage and a few days of purchase."
Won't stay on your feet
"If I could go 0 I would, it's definitely not a noes ring"
"I ordered this for a wedding specifically to be able to take my phone/ID/credit card with me. It is a cute little bag, but the iPhone 6splus does in fact not fit in this bag-so for me it is useless. I would give this bag 4 stars for quality and cuteness but the fact that it does not fit the phone as said in the details made me want to point out to others that may want to also use it for a bigger phone ... if you have a smaller phone it is a cute bag and yu shouldn't have any issues."
"Too narrow, so that the shoe arch dug into the arch of my foot and hurt a fair bit."
This product runs ridiculous small
Unwearable.  Returned.
"I have never left a review before, but thought I should ""share"" my thoughts on this item. These pants are much larger than the size should be. There is a sewn in ""crease"" that starts at the bottom and goes partway up the leg ending mid thigh that is not at all complimentary. Also the fabric feels like cheap polyester that my mom wore in the 70's."
"My mother bought these and can't handle them for long because in spite of buying her normal width and size, they run a little narrow and pinch."
"Luckily, I bought two belts at the same time, this and another.  This belt was a good two inches shorter than the other 34 black braid belt I bought and did not fit my husband at all.  Luckily, I have a son who is a 32.  It is also very thick, so if you want a soft belt, this is not the one for you."
"After 2 years of use I have to downgrade my previous 3 star to 2 star. It worked ok but the early issues I observed are worse now. When you start to fill it up to capacity, the weight balance when upright shifts toward the front and the feet of the suitcase are too close to the center to prevent it from toppling. One of the screws securing the top handle was loose and I had to keep tightening it after each trip; it finally got lost during my last trip. Also during my last trip (February 2016) I was travelling with Air Canada and for the first time I was denied using this bag as carry on because it was too big. Sure enough it was about 2 inches too long to fit in their dimension checking thingy."
"The shoes themselves were as advertised and cute but, they were at least two sizes too big. Since they were advertised as women's shoes, I ordered my usual size. It seemed like maybe they were actually men's sized because they were much longer when compared to my women's running shoes. My biggest complaint is that I was charged for return shipping when the mistake wasn't mine. The shoes weren't women's size nine by any means.
I returned the shoes and ordered from Zappos to make returns easier if needed. As it turns out, Zappos sent me a women's size and they fit perfectly."
"Wow, The boots are falling apart. When I got these boots I was so excited to have dry feet. Well here we are 3 short months later. The boots are splitting all over the place. My feet are wet and getting wetter. I wore these boots for 30 minutes a day at most. Long enough to feed the animals and thats it. So 30 minutes a day for 60 days and there falling apart doesn't seem right to me."
made for midgets. A mans large fits like a 3 year old toddler
"So disappointed!! First, it took forever to receive! The event I purchase had come and gone before I received!! It clearly states that it is a women's vest!!, but when I received the EXTRA LARGE that I ordered....could only get one arm in it!!!! My granddaughter that is a size one was the only person I could find that it fits!!! The tag is written in either Chinese or some other oriental language!! So, so disappointed!!! Save your money!! Wish I had!!!"
Sucks...
"The shoe is visually nice, but has a pungent odor!  They almost smell as if they were dipped in gasoline, so I hope my son doesn't blow up at his school dance next month.... :-)"
"I'm not sure what this company's sizing chart is based off of, but it is obviously outside the norm. Either that, or the manufacturer of the shirt is sizing it outside the norm.  I normally take a men's medium in a t-shirt and polo shirt style and I initially ordered this shirt in a large and yet that even was too small. Getting a shirt order straight/accurate shouldn't be such an adventure.  I was disappointed."
"asics seems to have changed their shoes. i've worn them for years and now my regular size is too small and I cant find one that fits I,ve tried larger size, then I tried wider and nothing works.  I returned this pair."
The fit and material isn't great
Now what I expected - hard to tie and fit
"This is another garbage product. You truly do get what you pay for as this was the cheapest Jameson shirt I could find. Not only did it not fit, the shirt itself was oblong and stretched. It looked like the person who stitched it together was on their first day or something.

And good luck returning it. I tried, they got back to me in a broken English nonsense email and that was it."
Not colors shown on original photo
Not flattering fit at all - too tight in waist. Fabric was not what I was expecting - too stiff and thick.
Don't even waste your time! The dress was way too small and cheaply made! Im 5'10 and 220 and it just didn't fit right! I would not recommend to anyone!
Disappointed with the color. I bought a White pant and I received a Grey pant
Quite uncomfortable. The seems in the lining hurt my feet.
"The belt is really not bad, it works like you'd expect, so if that's your concern don't worry about it.

HOWEVER!  The quality is complete trash, you can definitely tell this costs the mission belt company 6 dollars to make in China.  The leather is bad, the buckle is bad.  I don't see why they couldn't spend a few more dollars and make a quality product with the price they are asking for.

This belt would be pretty decent for the 10-20 dollar range and competing with the stuff you find in Walmart.  However at a price point of 40-50 dollars, it's just not worth it."
"cheaply made, clasp broke within a day"
"I was very disappointed..........the ad read size 39 only........and 6 pair left.  That is the size I wear, so I ordered immediately..........they came and were a size 36............and here they sit.............can't squeeze my foot into this shoe........The first time that Amazon has failed me........and yes, I did check several times to be sure it said 39............and it did, but the shoes were sized 36.  Unhappy!!"
cheap material I would not purchase this does not look or fit as look on the model
"This coat was huge!
I am 56 and 130lbs, I bought a small and was drowning in this coat.
The arms were too short, but wide enough to fit 3 arms In them. I would recommend trying another brand for a coat like this, the doing seems way off."
"This didn't work well, slipped on the heal."
Had high hopes after reading the reviews but my feet hurt within an hour and I couldn't wait to get them off.
"Too small and look cheap. The lens have an uncomfortable green look that makes you want to throw them away as soon as you put them on.
 This is my honest opinion. I bought this on my own, no discounts or gifts were given."
"The dress looked used and washed when I opened the package. Also was too small even though it says 2X, it fit waaay smaller."
color is WAY off from the pic
"Purchased these for my teen daughter in turquoise. Decided to return them before gifting them as they transparent and I know she'd be embarassed in them. The fabric is soft and silky, so I know she'd like that. But, I can't see her being comfortable in them. Maybe black? Not enough time to gamble before Christmas though...."
Hard to use. Trying to hook then put the bra on doesn't work. Threw them in the trash.
"Cheap, feathers molting all over the place"
It's cheap and won't last long but at $17 I guess that's what I deserve..
youth fit not adult
Very disappointed as I ordered a size larger than normal and they were smaller than those I bought before.
"I'm a solid 38 Short and slim fit suits fit me well. However, this suit jacket is ridiculously big. It's a couple inches too big in girth and is not slim fit at all. It's actually the opposite: very boxy in the chest/torso with no taper/contour at all and the sleeves are way too girthy (looks like I'm wearing pants on my arms). The armholes are also far too big for a slim fit and the armholes extend far too low for a ""Short"" so it fails the handshake test.

And now getting to the length. I ordered a short, and that's what the label says, but it's the same length as my old Armani Exchange 38 regular. It is a couple inches longer than my Banana Republic 38 Short suits/blazers.

Fabric itself doesn't look too bad considering its synthetic, but the fit is terrible so that point is moot. I look like a child playing dress up in his dad's suits.

The matching pants, however, fit very nicely. The legs could be a little slimmer/have a greater taper, but that's just my preference.

I bought both this suit and Perry Ellis's Grey herringbone two button slim fit suit and both of them have the same, poor fit.

Needless to say, they're going right back."
"Pros:
- cute
- fairly warm

Cons:
- you'll have to hand wash this. There's no way it'll make it through your washing machine.
- The first one I ordered was broken. The nose lit up maybe 1/10 of the time I hit the on button. As such, I re-ordered it. The re-ordered one was a bit better. It lights up 1/2 of the time.
- I'm 5'3 and ~100 lbs. This thing definitely runs large on me.
- The lights aren't placed well. Some of the lights are barely poking out of the nose.
- Pricey! For the price, I expected something much better and certainly more reliable. It took me a while to decide whether or not I would keep the replacement product. The only reason I'm giving it  2 stars is because I ended up keeping it. I'm a sucker for these holiday themed things and I did have a 20% off coupon."
Way too big and so that makes it even floppier. Not the look I was going for.
"i JUST got these today only to find they came in ripped. Not only that, but unless you're toothpick skinny, these babies are definitely gonna cut your circulation. So unfortunate considering these are cute but i want my money back or a replacement."
Shoe was too wide around the foot.
This shoe fits narrow. Worst shoe I have ever had for a medium width.  Bought a pair of GoLite  and they are a perfect fit.
"This jacket is very cheaply made. It is very thin and more like a light sweater as opposed to a jacket or coat. The belt does not have loops so if you don't tie it, it will fall off."
"The flowers are HUGE, and they hang awkardly.  Not was I was expecting, they looked quite ridiculous on"
Bought a size 9 and I usually wear a size 8 and they were a bit snug.  The quality and look was great!
Very cute but far too small. Normally am a size 12 but the XL was even too tight
I got this and immediately tried it on and the strap broke as I was adjusting the length.  The cups are smaller than my Victoria secret bras.  Not very comfortable either.
"Top fits fine, but unless your hips are under 32in you'll never be able to wear the bottoms.  What a bummer.  I'm a petite female weighing 115lbs, and the bottoms were wayyy too small."
"I was definitely not impressed with this product.  I had not even used the thigh highs once and as soon as I took them out of the packaging I saw what appeared to be a run on one of the legs.  When I put them on, sure enough, there was a run on the left leg (I bought them brand new).  Not impressed, and never got to wear them!
  BUT I will say this.  The company did a great job with getting the product shipped in a timely and efficient manner."
"I was hopeful for this.. I wearing a xl..
After reading the reviews i bought a 3xl AND bra strap extenders for the shoulders..
NOT EVEN CLOSE!!! I would have to be a medium to even think about fitting into the 3xl..
Very disappointed but the quality was good so 1 star for that at the very least! CHANGE YOUR SIZE CHART!!!"
"These are not actually denim. I ordered the ""black denim"" but its more of a thin material that is stretchy, like leggings. I am also 5'7'' and weigh 120 lbs, and the size 3 was too small for me. I think for $35 you can find better jeans....actual jeans."
Thought stone would be larger so small hard to see. I was disappointed!
"Either I missread something or these are just not sized correctly. I ordered toddler/little kids clogs in a size one. These are way too big. As soon as I am able to print a label, I will be sending these back."
"Elastic waist bank doesn't feel snug. Also the lace is way too long but doesn't help tighten. The peacock feather thing on the lace looks way odd than what it seems in the picture as it's rather large and keeps dangling thanks (???) to the long lace.
Material didn't feel bad but fit and the lace made it useless so returning."
too puffy
Zipper is defective and dirty.
they wore out in less then a month.
"This item does not look ANYTHING like the picture. It is significantly smaller, tarnished, looks like it's been sitting in the box for years upon years. I had to shine it before putting it on because it was so dingy. It also turned my finger green."
Not a good fit for women over a size G. Rides up and is uncomfortable
does not wear well.not made well.
I have wide feet so I purchase mens shoes often because of that. These are narrower than most.
very disappointed in how this fits.  I spent the whole class time tugging and pulling to keep the top from rising up.
"Broken. The inner glass tube arrived completely shattered. Metal case is nice, but the glass tube is very thin. I didn't notice this in time to return it (waited to fill it with sand for an anniversary gift until days before the event and realized it was broken). The package it arrived in did not protect it from damage. Very disappointed.

Product description reads acrylic, but I'm pretty sure mine was glass."
"The one star is based solely on the delivery time as I placed my order on January 8th and as of today (February 18th) I still have not received it. I was looking forward to getting this product to see how the size I chose fit, so I could order two more in other colors, but there's no possible way I'm doing that as by the time I finally do receive the hoodie it will pretty much be spring and if I do decide to order more, they wouldn't get to me until summer. I've ordered things from China with FREE shipping that arrived in a week and a half, but this purchase, which I had to pay the shipping on, is taking almost two months?!"
Doesn't look as nice as the picture. In my opinion very cheaply made. The material is very flimsy.
"This is not what I was expecting at all.... it hung awkwardly, it already broke right after I put it on... I expected more, won't buy from this provider again. I should've  listened to the other reviews. Don't buy it."
Poor quality also but returned due to size.
The style & fit are amazing butthe fabric is so itchy I can hardly stand it. This is a real disappointment from Patty.
"Runs very small, not very good quality."
"My husband bought these because the description says extra cushioning and flexibility. But he did not find this to be true. He's on his feet all day and needs some cushioning. Also the description says 22 ounces which is lighter than some of the other wolverines are listed as. But the ones he got were almost 28 ounces (size 10D). His 5 year old steel toe Wolverines weigh 28oz and he wanted something lighter. For the last two years he's been wearing a Craftsman boot that weighs 22 oz. He didn't like the extra weight of these Wolverines, and the lack of cushioning."
Fell apart first night worn.
"I got this to go over a dress, but its too flimsy, and the seams aren't done very well. When I took it out of the package it was super wrinkled and when I washed it it shrank. Over all not very happy with the purchase."
"it's a light shoe- I get it, not the beefy running shoe that you can go miles and miles in...but if I kept buying these things I'd go through a pair a month!  I am training for an Ironman, so yeah- I run quite a bit, but my weekly mileage doesn't usually top 25-30 miles.  I would suggest a Brooks running shoe if you're really going to run in these.  Otherwise, yeah- they're great for cross training in the gym and looking cute when you're getting groceries, but a true ""running shoe"" they are not."
Nice shoe but heel was too high for me. Returned them.
extremely narrow
Very cheap material. Wish I would have spend more on a quality shoe. Wedge dented and scratched after second use.
Cheap and thin. After one wash it became thinner and threads were already coming apart. I would not waste my money here.
"I love boots and was desperate for a new pair. I like the look and height of these ones, but the quality is terrible. Within the first few days part of the ""leather"" had already scratched off. Now a few weeks later the the sole is peeling away from the boot. Instant regret buying these."
Beautiful bag. Unfortunately it arrived with scratches all over it. Looks like it had been returned and the seller tried to pawn it off on the next customer.
"The bust size was a joke. So teeny I couldn't help laughing. This was a no go. Fabric would have been nice, if more than a quarter of my breast fit into it."
never saw shoes that narrow shoes are the hardest thing online
I do not have a wide foot and usually have the opposite problem with buying shoe in that a regular width at times is too wide.  Not only did these shoes run narrow they also ran about 1/2 size too small.  Too bad since the quality was nice.
"The bag is smaller than I thought it would be. Zippers are temperamental, no place to put your phone for quick access and it's really overpriced. I should have just sent it back."
"The back strap is too tight but the cups are kinda empty on top. It's meant for perkier people. I try to pick up my boobs and make it fit but I don't go that high. Looks artificial anyway.
Never buying a bra off the internet again."
I thought these were really cute but they are just not stretchy enough.  Very uncomfortable after an hour as they cut  into legs.
Great Color but not cut at the waist as I expected. Not feminine looking or fitting. Boxy. RETURNED.
"I didn't like this wallet.  It is only good for carrying multiple credit cards. There is no change compartment, and the bills have to be folded in order to fit.  If you want to carry credit cards separately, this wallet would be fine."
The back is way Too Short! Not satisfied
I loved these boots when they arrived.  They fit as expected and look brilliant.  However the left hand boot has a sharp lump inside in the insole which digs into my foot with every step.  I bought them as part of a cosplay and didn't wear them immediately.  Unfortunately it is now too left it to return them. I'm very disappointed.
"These shoes were very adorable.  The wide fit was nice.  However, the part above my toes was so tight on my feet that after 6 hours of wear, my toes were completely numb.  One week later and I constantly have numbness and tingles in my toes due to the nerve damage these shoes caused.  I would not recommend."
Had to send back.  No problem with refund.
"Title basically says it all. Flimsy, low-quality lenses, etc. There are various Chinese sunglass distributors that offer low-priced decent/OK quality items (bargain).

THESE are not a bargain. If you want the look, they'll do, but keep expectations low."
too thin for a man
Cheap- not the same cord as the High School or college provides. Wasn't able to use .
I returned this purse because it looked cheaply made in person.
"I received this belt as a gift.  While true to size and a cute belt, the leather is separating and the 1/3 of the grommets are falling out."
Came with loose threads. Definitely shorter than it appears in the photos and i'm only 5'5''.
"They look so great, but they are little hard, tough to wear. I ordered my size with time it got bigger, lose, don't stay on foot. Too bad they are not made from better material, fabric. I guess cant complain for this price. I thought i will buy other colors, but changed my mind. The quality is too low for me."
I liked the bangle... but it's so big for my wrist.... I wish it would fit...
No very good
While it is long and white it gets tangled easily and is very thin.
My husband is disabled due to strokes. His left side is affected by those strokes so he needs something loose enough that he can button and zip them one handed. The elastic in these pants are way too stiff for him to be able to do that. I was greatly disappointed with these pants and cannot in good conscience recommend them.
"You could do as well with a long t-shirt. Those of you who live in hot climates may like this, but we don't and I sent it back. Not great quality, though."
Too large need to return.
Very tight around the widest part of the foot and the arch support was lacking.
Wayyyy to small
"Took 3 weeks to arrive! Not sure what kind of material this is but definitely not cotton ( some kinda weird silky stuff???). Order a 2x, might be a 2x in China but not in the Southern Us. Sheesh skip this one if you're smart! Fake"
"Way to small. Once out of the washer realized they were very small, hung dry and still could get them comfortably on my daughter. My daughter is 24 months and the size chart indicated 2T/3T, she currently wears 3T clothing. Once out of the washer, I dug out the packaging that came with the product and sure enough it is way different then the size chart provided online. Now it is too late to return them and these are so small they aren't likely to my chunky 18 month old niece either. The packaging indicates that the cutoff for the weight on 2T/3T is 28lbs."
"I am 5'8"" and a little on the chunky side. I normally wear an XL or XXL in sweaters/cardigans and I like my sweaters bigger. I order a large based on other reviews and I was swimming in it. It made me look way larger than I actually am. It was a nice material and I liked the color, but I will be returning."
"Not true to size, the material is very see through."
They're very narrow is like they're made for skinny feets
These shoes were really stiff and uncomfortable.  I bought them for my spinning classes.  I returned them and got a different style that is much better.
I ordered a number of cheap veils from Amazon and this was my least favorite. The sequins was very loose and sloppily sewn on. It looked like it was falling apart. It was also very very silver and flashy.
"Too Short, and too wide.  Not a true narrow."
I only wore them 2 times and they fell apart
This runs real small I wear a medium as per the review I ordered much larger I wear a 36 C and I ordered a 2XL and fit perfect. I gave one star because it came damaged the under wires were not  sewn into place and keep coming out. Color is pretty.
"Ring was much larger than i expected making it appear  ""unreal"", and the stones fell out almost instantly, very poorly made."
they are very see through .. and did not fit well
"Reading others' reviews and seeing that this was a generic size - not labled men's or women's - I thought I was pretty safe ordering a medium. I usually take a women's medium and am 5'6"" and 150. It was a size or two too small. I know these are supposed to be snug but this made me look like a sausage. Including the sleeves. It's too bad because it was a nice looking shirt."
"the dress fit very well in the body but the sleeves are not proportional to the dress.

you need to be very small framed to fit on the sleeves, the seller just told me to get a large, but the large is for a size 12 and I am a size 6! so that was not a good resolution, show the reflection why the product is not sent out with love and care for the female body.

this dress is not worth the price."
Zipper slips apart
Hate them. Good concept though. If you truly have large thighs these don't work.
Garbage. These are a waste of time and money. I would not bother as this product is cheap and looks like it as well. Not happy and won't be purchasing again.
"Really liked the look of these shoes online and in person, despite their not being real suede.  That's why I was disappointed to have to return them.  They were a good 1/2 to 1 size too small.  I am a solid size 8, rarely deviating upwards or downwards of that number.  These didn't fit at all."
"Dollar store cheap. Another overpriced ""lightening deal."" The now normal price is the same as the lightening deal. All synthetic and see through thin."
Disappointed....ordered a small....fits like a medium
Fit fine but no where in the description does it mention that this outfit is see through... A disappointment
they are to long and too narrow
Ordered an 8 but it fit like a 6.  The pant I bought in the store fit perfect.  I ordered the same brand and size and it was WAY too small.  Very disappointed.  Colors are limited in the stores so I had high hopes for online. Very disappointed.
Don't waste your money. Bought a size larger that what i usually wear and it still looked terrible. Plus they keep $6.00 of your money when you return it.
Much narrower than other Keds I have owned. Had to return.
"Not flattering at all and did not fit well. Sleeves were way too narrow and short, like it was crafted to fit a t-rex."
I was very disappointed the style is very cute but the sizes are nothing like what they're supposed to be. I ordered the shoes to get them right away for my daughter's recital And the size wasn't even correct..I was very unhappy Now I'm stuck with these shoes
These were much too small. I have pants a size smaller than these are marked that are bigger than these. also comfort waste band is not very expandable at all. Not like other brands. Had to return.
"I've literally not even had it one month (it was delivered 14 October and it's now 9 November) and yesterday I noticed that the leather at the top of the bag has started to rip. I'm fairly certain that I've not cut it since I've had no knives or anything with the ability to cut in or near the bag so I'm pretty upset about this. The leather is very thin so it's only a matter of time before the rip becomes larger. For me this was a wasted purchase and my lesson has been learned.

If it's not going to be your daily carry, or not something that you're going to use on a semi regular basis you should be fine. This is definitely better suited to be used every now and then. Otherwise, you should probably steer clear of this as it's just not built for daily use due to how thin the leather is."
"This hat reminds me of something my Mother would like.  It is cute but the brim is too small for me(4"").  I was looking for Audrey Hepburn style.  I have a 22 1/2 inch head and the hat cuts into my head in a painful way.  I am going to have to send it back unless my Mum comes for a visit soon!"
My nips show through. I donated it.
"Horribly scratchy, stiff fabric, even on the inside of the shirt. Feels like burlap. Returned immediately."
Very cheesy.  Not good for much but cosplay.
"Returned the dress, but kept the jacket."
"With the name and other reviews and low heel I was expecting a ""comfort"" shoe.  I'll admit I have problem feet and a hard time finding shoes that don't hurt.  The hole-punched surface digs and rubs for me.  It may not for you.  Since tey are cute I've been trying to break them in.

The length is too long while the width is too narrow but probably because I have bunions. Nice cushion on footbed, yet still the balls of my fit are not comfortable enough walking on concrete floors.
May or may not keep them.  I have a 2nd pair I bought that I haven't worn in case they don't break in."
"Not stainless steel spring bars. Black rubs off easily. The nylon strap itself is pretty good and durable, just not the hardware it came with."
"Sole is broken,
only wearing for 2 months."
"Could be the color but fabric seems to show a bit too much of chest hair. I went with light blue but am now thinking the darker colors like black and navy might be better. Fit seemed pretty good (XXL and I am 6'2 220 lbs) but don't like that the outline of my chest hair seems to show thru, again could just be the light color ordered. Probably returning for a darker color"
Looks switched out around the neck and was to big!!
A waste of money and time. I donated it to a young girl.  It was not an extra large for an adult!
"Guys
The sunglasses come with several brands and use, lack of paint on stem glasses
the seller not even expressed written several times... and not answered
If you buy this sunglass from I.N. OPTIX LLC you willrecive this like me it seemed to me the original.

This guy even responde the emails...
LOOK another seller but not this I.N. OPTIX LLC"
I had to send them back as one shoe was larger than the other.  I would like to reorder as I hope it was just that one pair.  Very nice shoe.
"Thin material. Too long, going back"
"I bought these because of the reviews that these were amazing cushions for the feet. As I've gotten older, I need more support for my ankles and feet, which are flat. Typically I wear running shoes, but these are cuter so i thought I'd try them. I don't know what kind of shoes the people giving these rave reviews usually wear, but these were not the pillows of comfort I expected. They are fine for a casual, seldom worn sneaker. But they are not for anyone planning on being on their feet a lot. The soles were just not that comfortable. I typically wear Dansko or Keens. I returned these and got some Teva sport sandals instead and they have been wonderful. These were making my ankles and heels hurt. I think I'll stick to Saucony running shoes for when I do aerobic walking, which are great."
Thong part of flip flop broke and cause me to trip out of it-after only about four wears. Return policy is awful-30 days..i am over the 30 days by 5 days. ..theyre going in the trash will not purchase again!
"Great dress.  It is so long I will either have to hem it 3-4 inches or take it in to be hemmed.  Don't they realize we are wearing sandals with this?  Even with the tallest heels, it would have to be hemmed several inches.  I am 5'5"""
asian sizing. runs real small
"This is another case where I impulse purchased without reading reviews and regretted it.

It looks like it would be long, (I thought maybe hip length) but it's short - waist length. The fabric feels cheap, the print is not a nice as in the picture, and the tassels don't hang. They're stiff and don't move."
It broke one week after purchase
"I'm very disappointed. Not only would this fit a teenager (yeah, some 2XL!), but the helmet is way too out of proportion. If I wanted trash, I'd reach into my garbage can. The only good thing about it was the morpher, which was hard plastic and very real looking. Other than that, don't waste the ripoff asking price."
"The color I ordered, steel blue, was totally different from the color I received, icky grayish green. This deep V is quite deep.  I only ordered this shirt for the color.  I won't be wearing it or sending it back for a replacement because of the cost."
"Material and workmanship with the color of the shoe is very nice, but the pictures do not match the original color of the product. product more pale."
I understand that this is supposed to be tight but JEEZ I cant even pull it over my body with out losing all oxygen. I bought this to make those night outs better but there is absolutely no point if I can not move. I bought my size and I am not saying that it doesnt fit I am just saying that I like to be able to breathe when I go out and this product does not allow that for me.
"Great concept, but there's others that are much better. If you have a big bust, I don't recommend buying this as it is not easy to get the flanges in and out without hurting your breasts. Great for nursing, not for pumping though."
"Way too small. Shrunk even more when washed in cold water. Not a good product, don't waste your money."
I ordered this shape-wear in XL based on the measurement chart. It was too large. Did not shape at all. So I ordered the same in size L. This is a totally different piece. Not at all what the XL was. The hem is extremely tight and cuts into my hips but the belly is way too soft and doesn't shape anything. I don't like it and won't buy another one.
Ordered the XL and was too tight in the arms.  Overall runs small BUT was very very cute.
Good leather wallet but too cumbersome fir getting to cellphone
I have worn this style for yeqars.  I needed to bump up a size.  There was too little difference.  still too small.
I found them to have very little support and not comfortable to walk in!
"Very uncomfortable.
By third wear, underwire was popping through."
"Im a size 8, I have an hour glass figure and these pants were not flattering at all. The crotch bunches up and they simply don't make me look professional. It makes my entire uniform look sloppy. Theyre not as comfortable as the classic greys anatomy pant."
Very uncomfortable material. Returned immediately.
color was closer to black then burgandy
The purse broke the first day I carried it the chain broke and the drawl string broke. Not happy at all 
"These were white corduroys, something I don't really care for. I'm hefty enough without the added weight of textural pants. Plus the bright white in a winter pant doesn't work well with my wardrobe."
Keychain broke off the chain within a few weeks. It's lost now forever because the chain is low quality.
like they're made of paper
"This is a beautiful well-cushioned slipper,
however,
I've no idea if it was small or large because
although it was marked EEE,
it was so narrow.
I couldn't even get all my toes inside!
(The review required me to select ""small"" or ""large"" etc)

I'm giving them 2 stars though, 1 for the beauty and construction and 1 for the ease of return. Thanks anyway L.B. Evans!"
"Inseam 30 + Inches
Wife's 27 inches"
"The item arrived with no instructions.  It was not terribly hard to figure out, but the adjuster won't stay put inside the ring and pinches at the open ends.  Really not satisfied with this - I'm going to have to spend more money to get a different type of adjuster, or go to the jeweler's to get it professionally sized."
"Its wonderful on the shoulder as promised, but it is horrible on the bottom under the bust, it just didn't fit right and it kept rubbing against the skin.  I had to tuck in cloth under the bra just to finish the day.  I tried tightening it, but it didn't help.  I cannot wear it again. I'm a D-cup, perhaps its better on larger women?  Its a horrible fit on the bottom of the bra, they put all the thought into the shoulders that they probably forgot the rest of the fit!"
"I wouldn't recommend this shoe to anybody.  The quality of one shoe was as expected from Dansko, but the other shoe was poor quality, too small, the stitching was sloppy and itched my foot.  Unfortunately the return cost was on me as the seller did not provide a free return policy."
ok not what I expected
"To be fair, I don't inherently dislike the actual product. I do wish it was a bigger size, but that is neither here nor there. What disappointed me is the fact that I ordered a cute purple coin purse with butterflies and I received a boring black and white one. The style was completely wrong. I just decided to keep it as it would be a hassle to pay for the return and get it to where it needs to be and wait to see if I actually get the one I want back. It functions how it is supposed to. I guess I just need to buy these items at an actual Vera Bradley store."
They run small & have little bumps on the side of the foot bed that hurts your feet!!!!!
"The material was awesome and felt so good but they were slightly loose when I put them on and they are the type that after you wear them for an hour or so, they loosen so them they will look really baggy.  I wanted a size smaller but they didn't have any"
"For the price - I suppose they are good. But I'm not going to wear them. Maybe if I was just taking pictures of my feet they would be perfect.. but I wanted to wear them around our beach resort and that's just not possible... the chains hang down the sides of the foot so long that I'm dragging them on the ground - but the chain around my ankle is so tight that it's not comfortable. One part is too big, the other part is too small?
My feet are size 8 1/2... not an uncommon size... so unsure why they fit odd.
But, they are super super cute and if you are doing foot photography, they would be perfect!"
I received this item on time as promised.  But the large pink stone was already out of the ring and at the bottom of the bag it was packaged in.  I was diappointed.  It looked as thought one of the prongs was defective.  I returned it the next business day through Amazon.
eye pieces fell off after a few days.
"I have had skechers in the past but this one the bottom is so large that when I walked, my heel came out of the shoe.  The length was fine as long as I was not walking."
"I wanted a lightweight leather purse for travel. This was lightweight and cute, but the strap broke after a couple days. I only had about a pound of stuff in it. Also, the lining got black all over everything. I sprayed it with Scotch Guard fabric protector really well, and that took care of it."
These came and the person made them all inside out. All of the bows and flowers were sewed on to the wrong side of the headband.
"the description states long sleeves, but the one that came was short sleeve.  I paid only $3, so I did not bother returning it."
Way too clingy and runs small.  It's see-through as well.
These are so cute but so uncomfortable. I got these for my college graduation and I could barely walk. I was almost in tears.
"They are too tight at the calves... and the worst thing about them... they attract every little fuz and fur and hair in the world... EVERY little fuz and hair in the world... you're screwed if you visit a friends house who has a cat and 2 dogs... you're done for... Even without the pets... you're still gunna attract all kinds of crap... plus they are more skinny pants than anything else... if you do get em, get em longer and bigger than you would normally..... other than all that they are ok"
"Hello! I've attached some photos for you guys to see, the photo was taken during night time in my room using my lamp, has a yellow tint color to it.
Let me just say that this thing is definitely very cute and soft! It feels like you are holding a real bunny on your hands. The stitching is very well done and the quality of the fur + the leather used for th ears seems to be high quality. It doesn't have a stinky smell either which is good. Only downfall to this is that it shreds way too much. I wore a black shirt and I can see all the shredded hairs :( if you're allergic to furs or other things that shred easily you might want to take it into consideration."
"The dress fits tighter than expected. My wife is a petite woman and the size chart is a little deceptive. We are Christian's and I didn't realize the dresses can be so revealing to the body. Other than the fit the dresses seem to be really nice, just make sure you check on the sizing before you purchase."
"It fits a little weird because it's either too tight or too lose in certain spots. Granted it is adjustable, but after adjusting it so many times the tip of the flaps start to point upward. I wear these to work and I work retail, so they are very comfortable, but after wearing it a couple times the shoe bed got sticky and stinky. Makes my feet smell. I really dislike the shoe for that reason. After a few times of wearing it you'd probably have to replace it. This fabric foot bed isn't very good in any shoe."
"Beautiful color (olive) but the material is extremely thin. If you're a plus size girl like I am it will not do you any favors. Looks stunning when standing still but as soon as you start to move around, unless your legs are completely smooth and perfect, anything you want to hide will be on full display. Will be returning. Very disappointed as the pants are extremely comfortable."
Real cute and would have been nice if it had not come with a broken zipper. I tried to replace with same but apparently it is no longer available
"This is Not leather, Chinese have become very sophisticated with products claiming being made in the USA, but this is a complete ripoff."
Kind of flimsy.
Not the same quality as the older model. This is my 3rd Coach wallet/money clip. I have gone through one every 5 years or so. This is definitely not made with the same quality leather. I actually think its a knockoff bcuz Coach no longer makes this model
"Hard part lining the heel is sharp and digs in to the foot, I wouldn't be surprised if it broke through the lining within a month. Returned immediately."
it was a lot smaller than the picture represented and looked cheap
Gave them to my grandson
"The clasp broke off, pretty cheap on how it holds on"
"These sandals are getting a bad review and here is why.  I love the design , real leather and the nice edgy look!  I read reviews posted by others to size up on these sandals.  I purchased my first pair 1/2 size up (normal size 7).  They were too small!!  Unhappy but paid the shipping (1st time) and sent them back.  Ordered an 8.  They came TOO SMALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I paid shipping for the 2nd time and back they went.  I'm not wasting any more money in trying an 81/2.  They aren't cheap to start with!!!"
Beautiful shoes but leather is very stiff and uncomfortable. Will wear for short periods of time and for looks only.
"the skirt was not flattering at all, color was nice"
On the website it says they are straight leg 505. They couldn't be more wrong. There baggie in the thighs and butt. I should have listened to the reviewers they said the description of the jeans was wrong.
"Blue thread at two button holes on white shirt, sleeves at least one and half inches short!"
"Poorly made. A stone fell out, the second time I wore it!
It was too late to return it. I am left with a $75 broken bracelet! I loved that bracelet, it fit perfectly."
"Dickies used to be consistent and quality. Now I have notice the sizes are all over the place. I normally have dickies size 33 x 30 which are now way too small so I order 34 x 30 and these are way too large in the waist and the length? Basically it is roulette with sizing, guess a number and hope it fits!"
Size is a lot off
The headband does not match with the skirt. Cheap material & is too large for a 8 lbs  newborn.
Too tight and thin. I wish they stretched easier.
The size was a good fit but they are black and dark black at that. was expecting more of a grey color. They are also hevey shoes. I was looking for a lighter weight shoe. I am sure that they are a great shoe just not what I wanted. Tread would be great for winter/snow.
a big load of bull Crocs should be ashamed of these. DONT ORDER EVER  The shoe is deformed and not for human use.
Cheap. Don't buy
The one size fits most is for someone who is a small or medium. Very nice material tho. Had to return it.
One size doesn't fit all
Wasn't the same design as the picture
Way way way too big  I think it must've been mislabeled
Broke in one day of waring it.
Keeps spotting hands and everything with blue ink even after leaving it for ours in water.
"Sakkas fleece lined leggings are very comfortable, but they pill terribly.  I can only wear them 24 hours without needing to de-fuzz.  After 2 wearings, they are saggy in the knees and other areas of stress, but the worst is how they pill.  I've never seen anything so bad at pilling as this fabric.  Not worth the price...unless you want to wear them at home only, and don't mind that they look very worn almost immediately."
"The fit was quite odd. It seemed larger in some areas and then snug in other areas. The orange contrast stitching wasn't pleasing to me. It would have been nicer if the stitching was a lighter golden shade like traditional jean jackets or if it was black, gray or even white. I really wanted to like this jacket and hoped it would have worked out as a gift. Clothing is very subjective to taste and sizing, so it is hard to recommend this jacket."
"I returned them because I cannot wear shoes that do not support my heels. I thought the heel cup would do this. I bought TEVA Sandals and they are the most comfortable sandals I have ever worn and I have pretty bad feet. The Most comfortable Walking shoe I have bought is from New Balance though. they are hideous, but comfortable! :)"
The lace part was too loose; my breasts were popping out. Disappointed because I really liked the dress.
Quality was decent but difficult for a toddler to get their own foot in and zip up
"This jacket in no way is a tall size. I ordered a 2XLT and that's what the tag says too. But this jacket barely covers my stomach. I'm tall but not that tall. My height is 6 foot 2 inches. This jacket is about 3 to 4 inches shorter than what a TALL size would normally be on any other brand.

The hood on the jacket is so stiff that it's stupid. I would consider it almost hazardous to drive while trying to wear one of these hoods as you cannot look left or right without rotating your torso.

Outside of that, sure it's well made. This is the second Carhartt jacket I had to send back due to size issues not matching with the size scale given in description. I will not be buying Carhartt jackets in the future. Luckily I can return it and get my money back without paying shipping costs."
ugly and too big to fit in pocket
They run very very small
the skirt looks like it was made for a 12 year old little girl
"Having a great pair of sunglasses is important to me because I'm on the road constantly and I'm an outdoors man.  I really wanted to like this pair because they look so cool. I had them for a day then returned it.

1. They are physically attractive and but the quality/feel of the pair was disappointing.  Felt a little inferior in quality/material.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the lens scratch very easily.  The pair already had swirls that became visible when I tilted the glasses in the sun.

2. Although these were polarized, the objects I was looking at didn't look crisp or defined in the blazing sun.  They just appeared darker and dull.

For the price point, I would suggest the Revo sunglasses.  IMO, their polarized lens are one of the finest I've worn.  I had 2 different pairs in the past 20 years with blue water crystal lens that recently broke and thought I'd give Oakley a try.  Stick with what works.  I'm await for my new pair of Revo Holsby."
Poorly designed and made. Did not the Heshe logo on it. Sent it back...
Very small for plus size.
Much larger than they appear.  Looks cheap
"I really wish I had read the reviews before I bought them. I usually read the reviews but I think the low price got me to buy them before checking out the quality.
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
Now that I just read the reviews I see I'm not alone here.
I just got these the mail yesterday afternoon.
I put them on around the house ( they look really nice, run a little big but they are 9/10 and I'm a 9)
Today I walked around with them, when I took the slipper off the entire sole fell right off?????
Like really?? I think they are glued on with those cheap craft glue sticks..
What a waste of material for a cheap sole that just falls off..."
"...back of shoes comes about 2/3 of an inch short of the curve in the back of your foot. In other words the shoe is cut too shallow. I bought a pair at DWS yesterday was initially pretty excited about them until i took a closer look. Not only are shallow cut shoes uncomfortable, they look weird."
I INTEND TO RETURN IT FOR A SMALLER SIZE. OR HAVE MY REFUND APPLIED TO A NEW ORDER
not heavy very thin.. not what is described!!
ran really small
The boot was too narrow and I don't have wide fit. It was too pointy so I returned. The return policy was great though so I had no problems with the seller.
These must have been sitting in the warehouse awhile because they were extremely old. Every one of these ripped as I was putting them on my daughter. Huge waste of money.
Sized for a woman. I ordered an XL and could not get my arms in the sleeves.
"Smaller than I expected, I wear an 8 and they are tight on my leg/ankle. Also there were supposed to be four different pairs and they sent three different and two mona lisas. Lame."
"The product arrived quickly, but they snagged getting them out of the package and while the fit was good they would not stay up no matter what I tried. They ran almost as soon as they were on and I ended up just taking them off and going without most of the night."
never ware it cause its got giant sleeves..
i ordered the Large one.  But  ITS FOR KIDS.  I CANT FIT AT ALL.  DISAPPOINT.  Sad and i will never ordered again from here
"Purchased this for my husband who normally wears a small to medium in menswear. This jacket was too big, the arms were ridiculously long."
"PROS: They're soft and keep my feet from rubbing in my ballet flats.
CONS: They are totally exposed and not ""no-shows"". They're a little tight around the toes and started to feel too tight later in the day."
The cut is very small.
"I honestly did not realize I bought the burkibuk instead of the leather until they arrived, so no what I was expecting."
"There isn't anything special about this bra other than it is an unlined front-close bra.  It does not provide any smoothing on the sides or in the back.  I usually buy Front-Close Unlined bras from Soma.com, but they have discontinued this particular bra & I was looking for a replacement.  I hate padded bras!  I usually wear a 40D.  Other reviewers said that the band was tight, so I ordered a 42D.  The Band fit perfectly, but the D cups pooched out at the sides & I was actually swimming in this bra.  I returned it & have ordered a 42C.  We'll see how that works.

I ordered the 2nd bra in a 42C and the bra had the cups sewn in pointing off in weird directions.  This is the last time I'll order from Lilyette.  The bras are very inconsistent and not worth the trouble of reordering & returning them over and over again."
"Just got this today, go to adjust my Hamilton watch and it broke in half on the first use... I mean I can still make it work and don't care to return a $5 item but be gentle because you can tell that it broke because of cheap manufacturing. Plastic cools so fast that where it's joined together last is weak"
This dress was frumpy on me. Even when I'm casual I like to look and feel good in what I wear. This didn't do it so it's a return. It resembled a night gown.
Did not look good when I wore them. Not elegant looking rather bulky overall look. Felt comfortable though so leaving 2 stars for that.
"I bought the medium version of these because that was what size I wear. I even double checked their sizing chart that read in the product's description. When I got them, I couldn't help but laugh. They were waaaaay too big for me. I have a 32"" waist, and these mediums were at least a 34"". The draw string pulled all the way couldn't even keep them up. My recommendation is definitely going a size smaller than you are."
"The strap broke after one month.
It was so cut before that though."
Sadly... I was sent the wrong shoes. I am jealous of all the people who said the Plaid Brown shoe was so cute???? I never received them. I was sent a pair of solid black velvet-like shoes. Did not like the crushed velvet look at all. Really needed the Plaid Brown ones to match a specific outfit. Too BAD! I did return them for full refund.
"Cut cut and print, BUT Fabric feels like plastic"
Broke on the clasp after I wore it one time....not happy...I think it is because it is such a heavy necklace that the clasp was not meant to hold so much weight.  Donated it.
"Look super cute, but they were WAY too small. I fit comfortably in an 11, and that's what I ordered. Nope, the straps were stretched to their full potential and nothing. I'm super bummed."
Horrible fit... Not a true sizes it is tooo big... Way bigggg
Very tight on my almost 9 months old baby. I bought 9-12 months. ;(
"I was so excited about this top but the fit was WAY off.  Am 5,4 and 136 pounds.  I have a curvy but fit build and am a 36b cup.  This was REALLY huge and had a odd hang to it.  My roommate got it and she can wear it at least."
Spelling wrong!!! Really
Tarnished quicker than any other fake jewelry I've ever owned. Turned my neck green. Was pretty for about a week.
Stone is pretty but the stem is too short. So the back keeps coming off.
It was too short but looked good and cute
Ankle opening is very wide and does not cinch down small enough for my ankles.
"It feels too heavy, and sweat in it like crazy.
Stays damp feeling for a long time.
does not support my DD size well at all"
Very bad sizing. Xl is more like small. Better get xxxl
"I used the guideline of purchasing two sizes larger than I normally would and found that gave me the size I expected. However, the fit was not as tailored as the pictures of the item led me to believe. The shirt was wider at the bottom and billowed out a bit, which was not what I hoped for. The material seemed to be decent quality but was not very soft."
"Shoes were much narrower than I expected, cannot wear them"
"There is no doubt it is made of quality materials but the functionality is just not there. The bag is very deep but the only access zipper is straight across the top making it hard to get things in and out. The laptop sleeve can't even fit my small work laptop and I would refer to it as a tablet sleeve if anything. There are no side clinches on the bag so if you put anything in the large front pocket the bag pulls away from your back uncomfortably. It's a shame because I really loved the look of it. Add a zipper that wraps down at least one side, make the sleeve a separate area or larger, add side cinches and this would have been a winner. Unfortunately it's going back."
the ankle is cut way to small I couldn't even get them on
I bought the extra large since I knew it was going to run small. It would have fit if I was a lot shorter. It is really cute and the material was great but it is definitely made for someone a few inches shorter than myself. If you are shorter than 5'7 than this might fit you.
"No shape, cheap fabric.  Feels like tent material, only thinner."
"Being that this is a Superman shirt, I was expecting it to be super. Disappointment abounds! Although the fabric seems nice enough, take a look at the pic. The superman logo tilts upwards, towards the right, AND the logo is not even centered on the shirt! See how much closer to the arm seam it is on the right side? Sending this thing back. I'd expect this kind of nonsense on a Captain America shirt or perhaps a shirt based on that one time George Clooney played Batman."
"This is an cute suit but it runs incredibly small and it is very short in the torso, like a petite. I went up 3 sizes (on 3 orders and returns) and it still didn't fit right, then I just gave up."
Ohhhhhh my goodness......this thing is hideous.....soooooo much of a bra.....
This was very small. Maybe for a child. Not an adult.
This shoe's is wery large and not comfortable l not recommend for nobody and l wona return Now please sand me info for return product
"Much too small, however pants were good quality."
This material was not as expected nor was it what was shown in the picture . I was excited to receive this item but as soon as I took it out of its packaging I stuffed it right back in the box disappointed.
"GARBAGE! These shoes are garbage! They did not survive two months of LIGHT use. Even for under $30, this is the crappiest, shortest-lived shoe I have ever bought! Barely went anywhere with these, I was walking around the grocery store for an hour every couple of days. See photothe shoe is falling apart! I can't believe I have to give this one star! Cheap, HORRIBLE quality! Do not buy!"
The blue collar is smaller than the black or white.  They work for what I wanted but they are small.
"Unlike what the ASICS website says this sneaker is NOT FOR SEVERE OVERPRONATORS. I was a HUGE fan of the ASICS Women's GEL-Evolution 6 Running Shoe, but they stopped selling that, so i bought this. However there is not enough cushioning in this. I see the ASICS website has begun selling the GEL FORTIFY for severe overpronators, which i'm sure may do the job. But for now, i'm going to try New Balance New Balance 847v2 for Motion control. If that doesn't work, i'll go ahead and kick out the $150 for the Gel Fortify.
If you guys are like me, with severely flat feet but love to work out, make sure you search for MOTION CONTROL sneakers. Hope this review helps!
Nothing against ASICS. Like i said, i LOVED the Gel 6, but this sneaker received one star only because it is NOT for severe overpronators."
Cheap material and way too big.
"Great looking sneaker, but even in a wide it's extremely narrow.  I could barely squeeze my 20 month old son's foot into it.  I would not recommend this sneaker to toddlers/kids with wide feet.  Might be ok for kids with narrow feet though."
"This product would have received 5 stars except that after one washing a hole developed. Very disappointed.

The one time I wore it I loved it."
sorry that it is really really thin... I have already bent it.
"Fits a bit large, but that is not the issue.
The issue is that it is a blend of polyester that smells like chemicals and feels icky (technical term) to wear.
I washed it once, wore it and couldn't stand it, then washed it 2 more times and it still has that gawd awful chemical smell.
Since I washed it/wore it, I am not going to try and return it, but won't buy another of this brand.
Not sure what happend to the good old days when you could buy Wrangler products that were more 'organic' and chemical free."
Cheap! Looks cheap! Not flattering at all!
"Too big, doesn't stay on your foot. Don't waste your money."
This costume is really cheap looking! This picture is photoshopped for sure. The material is really itchy. Would not recommend this product.
"This is NOT the same dress the model is wearing and you can see it in the customer pics as they all have the difference displayed. How is it different?
1 - There is a seam with what looks like a zipper on the back. This does not exist on the garment you receive. Instead the creases are down the sides where the color blocks are.
2 - The model displaying this has the top come in and hit the shoulder muscles. This is NOT the case with the dress received. Look at the 4 pics women who bought this dress and put it on posted. The top comes in no where near the shoulder muscles, aka midway between shoulder joint and neck. Instead it sits off the shoulder joint. It's blown out immensely.

Other Cons:
- The arms material is not stretchy. So if you have big arms, it's going to be tight and not give. if you have thin arms, they are going to swim in it. There is no give and no stretchiness. (Look at the customer pics again, you can see in one of them it's folding over on itself on the arms).
- This is a $15 dress with a $25 price tag
- The tag is on the side seam at the bottom, no clear indication which is front and which is back. Normally this isn't an issue, but since the top is so BLOWN OUT WIDE it's not an 'at a glance you can tell' type deal. Instead you gotta line it up and be like.. ok that's my front that's my back.

Pros:
- Delivers quickly.
- The sizes are actually American in size and it fits as expected per size ordered but not design wise."
I don't like the chain its small and delicate and gets tangled easily. And the gold rubs off after just two wear.
"I want to love this dress, but the quality of it isn't the best. The belt that comes with it doesnt seem to match the style of the dress even though in the picture, it looks perfect. Because it came from China, it took a very long time to arrive in the mail so returning it would seem like more of a hassle to me than trying to find another belt to pair it with. I also don't like that in person, the off-white bib on the top appears to be a very dingy-yellow whereas the picture makes it look much brighter. Sadly, I would say that this dress isn't worth the money or the time it takes to arrive."
I brought this style over the Venture 5 I usually get thinking more money will equal more support plus I was looking for an all black pair. Big mistake! I'm a floor nurse and could only wear for a week. My feet hurt from the lack of arch support even with insoles.
"I love this, and I have it in a few colors. This particular color (burgundy? wine?) developed several little holes after three washes."
"This dress is well made, and it fit nice... as a shirt.  It didn't even fully cover my butt.  I am 5'9 for reference.  If you are anything over 5'4 this dress will not work for you."
"I put in a combination according to instructions, locked and unlocked it with nothing in it. I thought all was fine, so I put things in, locked it - and it never would unlock again. My husband used wire cutters to get the lock off - it went in the garbage can."
The socks were too tight. I ended up giving them to another family member.
"Heads up, since last year all shoes I have bought run 1/2 size small to 1 size small. I think the Chinese factories have in my 30 pairs of shoes, for family and friends; I bought in the total of 12 months missed the correct sizing, completely."
Returned item!
I just need to lose a lot of weight.
Literally falling apart straight out the bag. Such poor quality. I wanted to put it on a designer handbag but it looks to awful to do so. I literally gave it to my cat to kick around for a few days. I should have returned it for my money back
I ordered size 34. I received size 30. Sent a photograph in another posting.
my regular size does not work with these sneakers. Can not put socks on and get the shoe on. Look nice will give away.
"Let me start off by saying I love the look of this back pack and I love all the pockets BUT, my daughter has used it for less then two months and the zipper constantly separates. Shes in kindergarten so she doesnt know what to do when it splits or won't zipper. Also the straps constantly slip and fall down her back making it very very difficult for her to carry. Really wish t was just made a little better."
Probably won't last long.
Did not fit all of my husbands things
"These shirts seemed to be a good buy, and I liked the cotton/synthetic mix since this usually means that they are easy care.  However, once washed, these shirts require as much ironing as an all cotton shirt."
returned. very uncomfortable
"These very nice sandals are too short.  The strap on the back doesn't even go around my foot.  The sole is the correct length.  If I get a larger size, the sole will be too long and cause problems from tripping."
"Buttons stop working after 12 months. No warranty. It is a hassle to communicate with Suunto. They say online ship it to us, spend $40 buck and then we will tell you what is the problem to fix it. Ridiculous. Not durable at all."
Much smaller than shown model - one of the backs came broken.
"Very cute.  However, this is not one size fits all.  They are somewhat tight.  I won't be able to wear them for very long.  If I had the change for a re-do, I would not buy them.

LG"
"I was soooo disappointed!!  I truly wanted this coat, but I wear an extra large. I received one that fit like a medium!!!  I quickly sent it back!!"
"I previously had this boot without the side zipper.  I wanted to reap the advantages of the zipper, so this time I ordered this version of the boot.  By the way, my previous pair, which is almost identical save the zipper, lasted a year and a few months.  This is not at all bad considering I wear them every single day as an auto technician.  I would also wear them on my motorcycle.  Anyway, I figured I would go with the zipper version this time.  I wore them to work one day, after only a few hours of which, I felt pain on my inner ankles.  It turns out that the big metal zipper only has a small flap of material separating it from my ankle.  The zipper goes right along my ankle and with no protective material.  They are, for this reason alone, extremely uncomfortable.  I guess other buyers without this complaint must have less bony ankles or their ankle is not as wide as mine or something.  I have fairly wide and bony feet, so maybe it is just the way my foot is.  They have good arch supper for my flat feet; good overall build quality; good traction and tread with tall rubber soles.  My one and only complaint is that dang zipper.  I will send them back and get the version without the zipper."
"Not tee shirt material...not cotten knit. It feels like some sleezy, rayon polyester material. Very cheap looking."
"Didn't do the job, seems like a soft hold, like rubber cement, as opposed to something like crazy glue. I used this on the front of hiking boots where rubber is pulling away. I also used on a running shoe where sole peeled away at bottom. Both results were not good, rubber was not tightly adhered like I had hoped. I'll try again, maybe user error."
Th actual length was fine but holy smokes the foot slid around in the shoe something awful.  They were very cute and just what I was looking for but I'd break my ankle if I wore them with my foot sliding around so much
Ring was pretty but stone looked like glad not a diamond.
"Way too big, might be nice when she's a toddler"
"These shoes are known to be narrow in the toe area. Didn't know that until I ordered a pair for an edelerly friend.
Exchanged them for a half size larger and he's happy with them. They are one of the most comfortable shoes he has owned
and he is very happy with them."
"I guess it is the insulation that causes the boot to be too small.  I normally wear an 11 in Merrell and because of reviews, I got the 11 1/2, but too small so exchanged for the 12 and still too small.  I gave up and am looking for another winter boot."
Arrived missing a rhinestone. I would suggest ordering up a size. My 9 year loved them.
the v-neck was WAY too low. returned
Didnt seem to work at all
Buckle lock/release broke after a couple months.
The lace part is cheaply sewn onto the dress.  Looks very cheap up close
cheaply made. Returned them.
"These shoes are PAINFULLY narrow. They don't fit like my other Keds. I won't bother returning, but will try the shoe stretcher. They are definitely NOT medium, as advertised, but feel like EXTRA narrow. And I have a very average foot, where a true medium always fits."
"Came out of the box with scratches on one lense. I know they are inexpensive, but they're unusable with a big scratch... That kind of defeats the mirrored lens effect."
"The dusty pink was really dusty salmon. I like a loose fit, but the size small fit me like a large. I had to return it."
It's warm but not great.  The thing material keeps getting in my mouth.  You end up having a soggy face after a little bit.  I'm going to keep looking for a better one.
"I returned these shoes, the back of the shoe had too much room, my toes slid to the front, thus the room at the back, and they felt very unstable and uncomfortable."
"The illustrations aren't even close.  I didn't care about which colors I received but I wanted the bright and vibrant colors on the picture.
I received mostly grey and a maroon in very dull fashion.  I am tired of returning stuff because on the not exactly substitutions.
Don't qualify the product, send pictures that represent what I am going to get."
They are not consistent in size or fit.  Feels like nylon and you can see through them.
"Arrived bent in half, not what I was expecting at all!"
The Quality of this piece is fine ... It does not look like the picture though and I do not like it... I will give it away. I am also very disappointed that it arrived separately and I paid the same amount of money to clear this single piece as I did for all  of the other pieces together. When you live where I do ... packaging and shipping is very important!
I thought this ran exceptionally small for a large
"Very disappointed in these sandals.  One shoe stretched is in now too big for me to wear.  Very nice looking, but not the quality I was hoping for."
"I try to pay attention to the size descriptions on the product and not amazons size chart. This was so tiny even though I ordered an XL. Their sizes are off, this is a jumpsuit meant for medium or smaller."
I'm a medium so I bought a large.  Still too small.  It pinches around your stomach and gives you a muffin top.  The thighs roll up too .... It's a good idea but I can't seem to get the sizing
"My little guy is pretty little - not solidly into 2T clothing until several months after his second birthday -- but still. These are easily TWICE the size of other 2T underpants I've gotten him. I was so flabbergasted that I checked the sizes of his other underpants, and they match (2T/3T). They seem like a fine product.... for next year."
This bra was just scratchy and uncomfortable to wear and I do feel the 36 was not a true 36. I just didn't like the fit.
Very cute but much smaller than sized
"Skater of 19+ years checking in:

Literally just got in from my first skate after wearing them around for a week to break them in. Here are my less-than-thrilled observations:

1) The 10.5 are longer and narrower than a DC Skate Shoe, (and C1rca) which fit me perfect. My big toe on my front foot is screaming.

2) Despite the air cushion, these have little to no more cushion that a regular skate sole, which means they pretty much suck when you're not on a board. I was hoping an old-school shoe would offer more cushion on the sole but I guess I forgot what shoes like this felt like when I wore them 10 years ago.

3) The added plastic piece on the outside of the bottom lace holes are perfect and need to make a huge comeback in skate shoes.

4)The ridiculous amount of padding on the sides of the shoeespecially the anklesis unnecessary and detrimental. I did not ""feel"" a single flip trick and lost a ton of control because of it.

I can't believe I used to skate in shoes like this. They're like fortified house slippers with support in nearly all the wrong places.

Unfortunately though, they feel bullet proof and show very little signs from grip tape so it's going to be a while before I can justify buying a new skate shoe.

I'm surprised these shoes are still being made after so many years. I expected more for a shoe with a reputation like this. I'll be switching back to C1rca or DC."
"I may have been sent one that made it past quality control.. I am an avid fan of Timex, but this one let me down.  Within a workweek, two of the four decorative screws on the bezel fell off and the indiglo function began to work only when it felt like it. For the price you may be better off with an entry level g shock..being a timex guy that's a pain to type.  On the plus side it looked good and was comfy. Hence I don't mind having to give it one star.  It has been returned to amazon and exchanged for the casio dw5600-e1."
Not the color I thought. Returned them
Had this for a week and it's falling apart. The elastic is coming out of the bracelet and the color is rubbing of the gold and copper pieces. I thought for $21 the bracelet would last more than a hand full of wears.
"After reading reviews, I thought this would be a decent watch box. I am usually delighted with everything I receive from Amazon , But this is not worth 59 bucks, it's not what I expect from Amazon, it's Junk for no other choice of words. I'm glad that Amazon has a great return policy and that is exactly what I am doing with it. Sorry Amazon."
Hat was too small for my head. Thought the brim would have been a bit bigger but that could be my fault in reading description. It's an ok hat. Will give it away.
Huge.... order 2 or 3 sizes down. Bottom kinda flares out a bit. Weird cut. Colors faded. Looks like it has already been washed 30 times. Not returning due to not wanting to pay for shipping. Guess I can wear it to clean house in.
"I returned this item.  I just couldn't get the front to look right.  The material was too loose and hung on the side.  Also, the material felt really cheap - I've seen other reviews of this that mentioned ""Halloween Costume Quality"" as far as the material.  I agree.  But, the return was a breeze and I do appreciate Amazon's customer service."
One of them broke the first time I put them on. You definitely get what you pay for.
Great product but runs extremely small. Didn't want to deal w/the hassle of a return so we just kept it--my 2 year old should be able to wear it in a couple of years.
"I've had my original pair of Spanx I purchased in a store for a couple of years now and they're still in great condition. These started to unravel around the leg openings and stretched a it along the rear seam going up the back. They looked identical to my other pairs, so I don't think they're a knock-off, but they sure didn't hold up as well."
"Was so excited to find this bra on here for a better price than the other large retailers.  Wore out a previous CK F2892 bra (this one) but liked it so much wanted another.  The bras are well made and hold their shape well thru many washings.  I don't remember having this trouble with the old one I wore out, but the new ones (I purchased 2) WILL NOT keep the adjustable straps at the place I adjust them for more than ONE wearing.  The silky straps that go over the shoulder won't hold after they've been adjusted to be shorter.  As a result the straps fall off my shoulder during the day (and at work) and I'm constantly digging under my shirt and pulling them back into place.  Extremely aggravating, a daily nuisance, and is there anyone who can tolerate their bra straps hanging around their biceps?!  If I had wanted a strapless bra, I would have purchased one.  This bra is of good quality overall but the strap design is a major flaw.  Purchase only if you like to take the time to sew your straps at the proper adjustment to fit your body."
"Advertised as 98% cotton, it is 98% polyester!"
"Too large, went on vacation and forgot to return them, is it too late"
"I expected it to fit like it does on the model since it's one size fit all, but it was super large, even on my 32 DDD! I'm 5""3ft and 28"" waist and 120lbs. It is way too large, probably like an XL or XXL, since it doesn't even fit my breast size. It's most likely meant for ladies with bigger boobs because it is very loose on me. I was very disappointed, so I returned it. The website should have gave measurement of the ""one size fit all"" to prevent this kind of bad purchases."
too small and poor quality fabric don't buy it...
Watch only lasted a month before strap fell apart
"Bought many items from this site and most fit too small, but this fit was too large.  This fit like adult size"
"I bought this backpack in September 2011 for a middle school student.  The first issue with this backpack is that it is quite heavy. It weighs 5 pounds empty. Add another 20 pounds of books, notebooks, a laptop, etc it becomes extremely heavy to carry on one's back. So, why not use the pull out handle?  The handle is not sturdy in this backpack. It looked suspiciously unstable and wobbly . As expected it simply broke off in mid December. Therefore, the backpack lasted about 3 and a half months. The way handle broke it can not be fixed and since the backpack is so heavy with books it has become unusable."
Item shouldn't be $91 . Knock offs.
"Look cuter in the picture...material not good quality.  I bought this cheap and still didn;t keep.  Cut is ok, but I can't believe anyone would happily pay the origianl asking price.  Just blue and white stripes and not even a pretty blue.  Returned it."
"Okay this is insanely misleading. Firstly, this is NOT a blazer. It's like a stretchy spandexy sweater thing. The only reason they say they have larger sizes is because you can stretch it around you. Per other reviews, it's soft and comfy but it's SO unflattering. You get what you pay for folks."
The boots  came on time and that was great but they would too big and not made very well.
"returned, too small and too constricting."
"Second time we have traveled internationally with these tags.  While a nice idea, they have come apart, the rubber gets damaged.  We think the tags are too long so they are getting caught someplace in the baggage handling process.."
it's an ok shirt that looks great but fits oddly. Love the fabric but the fit is for a non athletic person.
"So bummed, because we love all the compartments, pockets & bungees on this, but the zipper for one of the large compartments broke the first week my daughter used it. We put it back together, but it kept coming apart. Once that zipper broke, the whole pack seems unusable b/c that compartment gapes open. Really too bad. The rest of the pack is durable, but the zipper does not match it in quality or durability. And it was too late to return it. I would not recommend it. :("
"I would not buy this duffle.  The only reason I have it is because it was offered to me in return for a review.  I'll probably end up using it for storage.

First the positives....
It seems to be well made and is very lightweight for the size.  The ballistic nylon is heavy duty and tough.

I am tall and the extension handle extends to about 41 inches off the floor which is nice for me.  There are two extension handle positions with the lower one being about 36 inches off the floor.  If the extension handle is pushed in all the way, there is a handle on the end of the duffel that could be used to roll it.

The duffel has pockets on the outside for storage of items that need easy access.  There is one combination lock included , but a minimum of two is required to secure the items inside the duffle.  Two additional locks are needed to secure the outside pockets.

The duffle is HUGE and is rectangular so it will hold a lot.  The storage space is very accessible.

Now for the negatives.

For me, this thing is way too large.  It is lightweight (a plus) but when fully loaded, it will weigh a LOT.  If it is packed with normal items, it is almost guaranteed to trigger overweight baggage charges with the airlines.  If you are moving and require a lot of luggage space, this might be OK.

It is very expensive for what you get.  Well made, but expensive.  I traveled extensively internationally with my job before I retired and I found that it was more beneficial for me to go small (lightweight) and inexpensive with my baggage.  About 35 or 40 pounds total weight woukd take care of me for three weeks.  I always tried to pay well under $100 for a piece of luggage.

The attached booklet that came with the piece does not apply to this bag.  For example, it talks about a ""new lever lock expansion"" system which doesn't exist on this bag.  It also says there is a ""new recessed four wheel design"".  To me, a bag this size would REQUIRE four wheels, but there are only two wheels on it.  Turns out this booklet was just Marketing fluff that had very little to do with this bag.

The bad has a ""Tumi Tracer"" feature that is described in the booklet.  This is a bar code that is affixed to the bag on the bottom near the end.  The booklet describes it as a ""unique registration number"" but I has to hunt to find out how to register it.  I finally found a card that had a small paragraph that said to go to the product information section on Tumi.com to register it and to get information on setting the combination lock. Somewhere else it said to go to Tumi.com/registration but that page doesn't work.  This tracer feature is not going to give much advantage and is just more Marketing and of little practice advantage.  The airlines tracking systems are quite good and mis directed bags are located quickly.  If you use luggage tags as the airlines instruct you to, that provides a secondary tracking system.  I honestly see no need for something like this.

On the registration and setting the lock.... I went to the site and hunted until I found where I could register the tracking number.  You have to enter a 20 digit number from the tiny bar code to register the bag.  The numbers are VERY small on the tag and run together without any spaces or separators.  Very difficult to read and accurately transcribe.  The best way to do this would be to take a photo of the bar code rage and enlarge it.  Way to much trouble for a feature with doubtful utility.

The only reason I can see for registering is that this appears to be the only way to find out how to set the combination on the lock.  Also, unless you buy more locks, this single combination lock doesn't protect any of the contents of the bag.  One additional lock is required to fully protect the interior and then two more are required to protect the pockets.  The reason for this is that there are two interior sections that can be accessed separately.  A flap at the top (where the lock is attached) gives access to the top section and a zipper that runs around the bag gives access to the bottom section, allowing the bag to open up like a suitcase.  The problem is that there is an interior fabric panel sepating the two sections that can be unzipped allowing full access to everything.

So, as a seasoned traveler, I would not get this bag at any price, even though it is an obviously well made, sturdy bag.  If I had known beforehand what I know now about it, I would not have even accepted it free."
overall these boots are ok. the color is nice and true to the picture. the line of the shoe is outdated as the toe is long and neither pointy nor really rounded. the most disappointing part was that the shoes were obviously used!!! the suede was all scuffed along the inside like someone had rubbed their feet together while walking and there was dirt stuck in the treads of the sole! Ive read other reviews of people having trouble with amazon shoes. usually they are pretty good as i have bought many pairs from them but in this case it was a big let down.
"I heard great things about this shoes from youtube, but it did not work out for me.
On the back of the shoe, where you see that little loop, the fabric just under there is sharp and it rubbed against my ankle causing irritation leading to callus. This is a design flaw on NB's part.  Because I live in TX, shippping the shoe back to the seller in the UK would leave me a $10 refund.  I've decided to cut out the back with a scissor."
Ugly material would not recommend this to anyone And it's to tight on me even tho I'm already a small person and I tried to return because it looks like a costume it's very hideous material  and there trying to refuse my return telling me to give it to a friend it's to ugly to even give it away the only place it's going in the trash.there's no use for it what so ever not even a costume very disappointed!
"Photo misleading! ... Buyer beware!...

The hat sent to us had no grommets ... !  Not good!

Misrepresentation!"
Hard plastic part on the straps sticks into your foot making them unwearable- I wish I had listened to a review here that said that! Also the pink cloth part is too hard and inflexible. You can wear them with socks maybe but it defeats the purpose of sandals- I often do wear my sandals with socks but I want the option of wearing them with bare foot or nudie socks which offer little protection against uncomfortable shoes. Even with socks they don't feel all that comfortable. I recently bought a pair of fitflop slide sandals at Marshalls which are so comfortable. These don't feel as comfy / soft in the soles so I'm wondering if these are fake fitflops?  Too bad because otherwise these are cute and I love the hot pink.
Really nice quality leather glove  but ordered it according to sizing instructions -  way to small.  3-4 sizes too small
"Very,  very uncomfortable"
Im giving it two stars because the colors and design but unfortunately you can not work out or walk without taking back this leggings to your waist. The fabric is poor quality.
The socks are fine but they still slip down in my shoes. It must be me!
They are huge bought a 7 cause they said it runs big but even that was huge fit a woman with a size 10 foot. They are so cheaply made . touching them and moving them they sound like paper no joke not worth the money
"Wanted to like this bra.  I wear a 34DD (very full breasts) in Wacoal and Wacoal seems to be the only bra that fits me properly.  I ordered the 34DD and the band size is too large and the straps are too stretchy to accurately support. The cup size is too small with ""spillage"" over the top. This bra doesn't come in a smaller band size. It is very, very comfortable.  There is absolutely no scratching, poking or digging. I think if I could get it a size that fits it may have worked.  Didn't minimize much either."
This this purse is not made out of leather as the product description states. It's made out of plastic. I tested all parts of this purse and it is definitely plastic.
I returned the one I bought. The outside was very stiff and not soft. It kind of felt like a soft burlap.
Cheap look and feel. Not happy with this shirt.
The inside is made of inferior quality material and is very loose so access to stuff sometimes take a while. I have this bag for about 10 months and it has already started stripping off. Would have been a lovely bag if the material quality was better.
"did not stay up at all!  horrible, the adhesive was pilling off as i was wearing it.  so aggravated!"
I was send a pair of womens size 8 modi 2 flip in brown and tan...not mens size 8 crocs modi 2 realtreee max-4 mens flip flops.  Very disappointed.
Sizing is way off on this product.
"The brim is too large and it is flimsy.  It does not hold it's structure well.  It does not pack well either, making it hard to get the crinkles out once packed in your suitcase.  I did not even bring it home from vacation, was not worth packing.  Disappointed in this hat."
This shirt is huge. Fits like a tent.
"Rise is 11"", supposed to be 10.25"". I ordered several pairs and the length varies by 2 inches. Pants have a chemical smell that doesn't go away with washing. Smells like burnt rubber. Will not order again. Can't return because I took off tags and washed them, I expected them to fit like the others I have been buying from LEVI's for the last 8 years."
"I thought I was getting a great shoe, based on several comfy pairs of Clarks shoes I already have. But now I realize I love those shoes because the sole is flat not curved, so my foot lands squarely on the ground. Clarks ""bendable sole"", is round in the center of the sole, and cut away at the outside edges...Causing the shoe to rock left & right...Thus throwing off your center of gravity, causing your foot to painfully twist. At first I thought I just had to get used to it, or re-adjust the Velcro. But alas, I have twisted my foot several times, leaving me limping for 2 days, from painful muscle strains.  So sad because it is a great looking shoe, buyer beware, dangerous to wear even for a short distance."
It does not fit tight on my head
Mine were delivered with 2 huge holes in the seam.
"The dress is pretty to look at, but when I tried it on, the fit was all wrong. The cups barely covered my chest, and I am not big at all. Then there were two openings under the ""belt"" area that were visible when the dress was on. Just not made very well at all. i returned it."
Wanted to love but the strap around the ankle was huge!!!  Too wide and too loose even on the tightest hole. If the ankle straps had been smaller and fit properly I would have kept. Runs slightly small. Ordered a 10 which is my normal size but I would have needed at least a 10.5.
"Cute, but the main token with the Taurus symbol arrived with scratches on it before even taking it out of the package.  Too much bother to send it back."
"Too small, but the pattern was nice.  I'll give it to Goodwill..."
Shoe has a very narrow fit...Had to send the shoes back-not I'm looking for other options.
Looks like it came out of a cracker jack box
"It's okay. Looks really cute but there are no adjustment rings.  Like you can't choose a size you'd prefer it to be at, there's only one ring to put the clasp on to.  I ended up attaching some more rings myself to make it a little more loose because it is very tiny but I have a 26inch waist.  If you're smaller than that, you're good, if you're bigger than that, steer clear."
"The tankini top straps are useless--there are two criss-crossing straps on each side, but only one of the straps on each side is adjustable, so if you are not well endowed on top and want to adjust the straps accordingly, it is a fail as the 2nd, non-adjustable strap hangs and flops, basically destroying the look. This is such a major design flaw, I don't understand how it could pass from the design to production stage."
"The wallet material was decent but it was way too small. When I first opened it I tried to take out all of the cards that were in the slots. I had a really hard time getting them out, it was liked they were stitched in when it was made. After ripping all of that out, I tried to put in my cards. The slots were very small and I couldn't fit any of them in. I just gave it away at a garage sale. Save your money unless you are buying this for a kid that has no licwnse or credit cards."
We were very disappointed in the Wristlet when it arrived.  The appearance and construction were not what we expected for the price.
Too hard to adjust. Doesn't stay tight
"Would have never ordered this dress if I knew this was made of the ""thick"" polyester.  I like dresses that are 3 seasonal not one. In addition the dress looked absolutely terrible on me....  The dress looks better on the model."
I orderd size 7 and it came 2 diffrent shoe  seize's on a Same pair.. : (
Too small for my daughter to use for school so I returned it.
"When I waer this shoe, I fell so hot. The upper is not breathable."
"Very cute, the look was exactly what I expected! But, the quality was very poor! It is very thin cloth and the lining has already ripped on mine! So, now I have to get a better made one. I'm sad because I love the style of this bag."
The shoe is very long in the toe everybody said it looked like a clown shoes on methey are made improperly  and shoe size is only a 7looked like I had a size ten on  never buy from them again
Scratchy stiff material around the neck and the sleeves.  No child would be comfortable wearing this!  I returned it.
Thought it would be good. It's made of poor plastic. Not recommended at all.
"Other than waiting forever for it to arrive, the product was not as vibrant and flattering as the picture. My flowers were not radiant pink like shown they were a dark purple and not really well defined (kind of look like blobs not so much roses) The fit was a little off. The garment is see through. Would not suggest."
"did not have a front of back labeled, and didn't lay right no matter how I put it on.  It always looked backwards based on the bunching at the neck"
Clarks run super narrow & were never able to break in enough to wear
The ring turned my daughters finger green after a couple days of wearing it.
"Six months after purchase, the zipper began opening from the bottom and would not stay closed, so the jacket cannot be worn."
Too bulky. I'm going to return them.
They are too small...I ordered 2XL ..I wear L and they are too small.
"The straps were smaller width wise than I thought. There wasn't enough holes in the belt to adjust to the length I needed. I was very disappointed. I love the concept but for me, the product did not deliver."
"These earings color are barely blue they look almost like a diamond with a hint of blue, also they were very small.  They were big enough for an infant but too small for my 6 yr old daughter.  These were disappointing"
"DO NOT BUY! I got this for my baby girl.. she wants to be Ariel for Halloween.. this wig looked PERFECT in the picture. I wish I would have read the reviews. Everyone is absolutely correct. This wig looked like it had been worn.. it was matted, a tangled mess! UGLY! It didn't even remotely resemble the wig in the picture. The curls were bent, it looks like very damaged, over-processed hair. Her wig from Strawberry Shortcake LAST YEAR looks better than this wig did.. and we've had that wig for a year! VERY DISAPPOINTED!"
These are very cheaply made and I kept the mother half and the charm came off without my knowing.  I think my daughter's eventually came off as well a total waste of my money
Warning: You will only receive one t-shirt. The description says it's a 5 pack--it is not.
"I feel like I bought leggings from the juniors department. And don't get me wrong, I'm tiny and have more than one outfit I'm sure that I got in the juniors department, but these are really bad. They're smaller than expected, made of a really cheap material, and are really stiff. I always buy cotton leggings because I like the way they feel more than the spandex ones, which tend to ride if you know what I mean, but these aren't worth it. It feels like someone starched them or put them in the dryer on high for too long."
like a piece of fabric from the $1 store
"30-38 is in fact 30.. I can basically keep it till kid grows up a bit, but thats about it.."
"Package arrived earlier than expected. Took the earrings out of the box, tried to open them and one immediately broke. Also, they're not round...more of an oval shape."
Doesn't fit right and i ordered a size that should fit.  the price should be a lot cheaper than advertised because quality of the material was so thin and kept sliding up as I wore it
The quality of the purse is good. But the size is too small if you want to carry tablet phone and toiletries bag. The amount of time for delivery was abysmal. Recommend you really know dimensions before ordering.
"returned due to a broken zipper, hate receiving broke stuff."
Greats hint of sparkle but MASSIVE.  they are opened so I have to keep them. Maybe in a year or two they will fit.
"waist fits fine, but shorts are way too baggy. i usually wear a 36x30 levi's and dockers (i know...) and i'm like 5'10, ~200lbs. i like the champion ones much better."
"Seemed solid and my daughter liked the fur, but the strap broke after only 2 or 3 wears.  Very annoyed."
"way too small, can hardly be seen, way to small to use for anything, they are very thin tin, not worth the price paid for them, wished they looked as good as they do in the auction, very very mini sized betty boop earrings"
"The look is not good and they are too loosy between the calf and the foot. Beside, too tight for my leg."
way smaller than pictured
"Unfortunately, these shoes have a terrible cheap plastic odor and I had a hard time taking them out of the box.  They look wide.  I plan to return due to the smell alone.  Can't bear to have my kiddo wearing these shoes."
"Started using them today. And lots of people have been complementing me on my boots. It's not light but it does not weigh you down when your on the move.

After a month and a half of use the shoe is leaking and a fear bit of the design has come of. So i am really disappointing. As i like this product so much."
Not a fan. Way too large.  Wrong sizing.
Clamp won't even open. Cheaply made.
"Very short, pants required"
It ships from china and is about 4 sizes smaller than what you would normally wear. I'm sending it back. Buyer Beware!
I odered this in a 3x i normally only wear a 2x at most. This leaves about 6in of leg showing im 5'9.the top is tight above my breast about half way down.for reference  im only a b cup. The shape is what it is in the picture.the bottom is tighter. The hips are huge in this dress and the v is barely  a v neck at all...im not sure how i will wear this. Hahaha id say order 3 sizes up if youu want it to fit like the picture
Looks ridiculous! You have to be a stick with no ass at all to wear it!~
The description said it was gold. But very shortly my grand daughter's ears were completely infected and she ended up having the pierced ears close up. It was sad to me. I guess it must be very lightly plated.
They hurt my pinky toe but I've been having this problem with quite a few shoes lately.
Fit was nice and great material but it's not burgundy at all! It's more like dark pink.
"Suppose to be plus size, too hard to get on or pull off!"
"Didn't like the flavor and texture of it, felt old/dry"
"Had to send this one back.  As my son put it ""it looks like a toddler drew on the heart and chain""
Mostly sending this back because of the pants.  They were completely see through.  Looks like they were made out of drapery sheer material.  I would have to buy another set of pants just to put under this one.  Trying a different company.  Rubies is getting too cheaply made."
"These shoes run incredibly small. I wear a 9.5 in every shoe ever, but these shoes were a full size too small. They look great and would have probably been my favorite shoe."
It doesn't fit!
"My son only wore these for a grand total of 14hrs and the back pocket has worn through & is now a big hole
Won't buy these online again! Paid extra to have the Carhartt name - wasn't worth it"
I do not know why this is still up I had a big issue with it and called Amazon. I was told they were going to fix it but as you can see they have not. If you are looking for an E3 or XW this is not the boot for you. It is miss labeled and is way to small. Sent my boots back the next day.
"Way too small for my 7 year old, and he's a small guy."
"Socks are not made in the US.
Delievery takes too long
Dont buy them"
Awful quality. Fabric is too thin and stretchy and there is zero support in the front causing the zipper to show. The sizing felt right but they looked terrible on. I've donated both pairs that I bought.
"Too tight, too short. It's typical with clothes now that are made anywhere but the US"
Fell apart after wearing it less than 1 month.
"This is a  cute dress, and this is a reasonable price for it.  It is well in a stronger way than most, and has held up well (I bought it about two years ago).

But if your child is at all sensitive to fabric textures (and how many young kids are there who are not at least a little adverse to scratchy outfits?) do NOT buy this dress.  My children have barely used it, as it is unbearably scratchy in many different places.

While there are things to like about the dress, it seems like comfort should be top priority for all makers of kids costumes.  And even if your daughter could pull through on Halloween with it on, the best Halloween costumes turn into dress up outfits for the best kind of non-linear play during the rest of the year.  Given how scratchy this one happens to be, I cannot really recommend buying it."
I ordered 61/2 they came with 2 sizes written. The bottom inside said 6 and under the top it says 61/2. They feel like 6. I like the heel being raised a bit but will not order again. Will stick with Keds they fit much better.
"Poor build quality. There is an unsecured flap on the back of the shoes that catches on my pantleg with each step. I have only worn them for a few hours and this flap is already beginning to curl up into an ugly duck tail. The tongue has a tendency to slip into the side of the shoe when worn. Loved my last Adidas, but this purchase left me angry"
Looks cheap and you need to order 3 sizes bigger. The XL fits a size 4. 
"Too wide, will give as a gift!!!"
"A product is only as good as the reputation of the company. I bought a pair of these slippers for my husband for Christmas. They were a bit pricey but the reviews were great. The slippers themselves are fine. A few weeks after, my daughter's not so well behaved dog peed on one of them. My husband e-mailed Old Friend's customer service for ideas how to clean. He heard nothing back. A few weeks later I, as well, e-mailed them,(we are using their website) and again not one word back. I can probably google ideas on ways to clean, but thought the company might have some tips as well. I am very disappointed. If not for such poor customer service I probably would of rated these slippers much higher, but if a company cannot even try to service a customer it bodes badly if you ever have a question or concern. For this reason I do not recommend this product or company."
Bows are cheaply glued on the front of the shoe. One has already come off after only a few hours of wear.
"Is a shame because I love this bathing suit but it is too short. Wanted to return it for a different size but it's not eligible because it's 30 days after it was shipped out. Problem is, it took longer than 30 days to even get here, so that's kinda unfair."
"Beautiful boot....except on the back of the boot, there is a small square piece of hardware. Looks pretty but digs into the back of your calf...ouch!
Sending back today."
"I bought these for my 5 year old, who wears a size 12 in almost any shoe.  This were super tight on him in the heel.  He said they were super uncomfortable, so I returned them.  This was the second pair of DC shoes that I have tried with him, and he said they were both uncomfortable.  I am not sure if it is the cut of the shoe, or if going up a size would solve the issue.  I am just not going to buy them online again.  I will stick to the brands that I know work with him."
"These sandals should be labeled Wide width. I have always wore a Medium width shoe.  These are great in length, comfort and arch support but the width is too wide.  I wished they would have sold a smaller width of sandal and I would have bought that."
"*I am a female*

BUYER BEWARE!!!! This sweater is wayyyy too small - and I went up several sizes! The fit is very weird, and I attribute it to how small the product is made. This product is clearly made for short, petite people."
"Cheap, poorly made and looks nothing like the picture!!! And if you try to return it, tyou have to pay very expensive shipping!!"
Comes two sizes too small also the Velcro is not very heavy duty.
"Did not care for these. Smaller in the waist than hips, which do not fit me well. For other women they might fit great, but if you don't proportionately have a smaller waist compared to your hips they don't work."
"I knew it was cheaply made but not THAT cheaply made!!! The ""stones"" are plastic glued into settings and they don't even fit right. Then again, for $3, what did I really expect?"
"Very uncomfortable!
I had White Mountain before and that is the reason I got these boots.  It looks exactly like the ones I had before.  However, this one is very uncomfortable!
I have been using it for a month trying to make it better, but it is not working.  I do not recommend these specific boots from White Mountain"
The scarf is lovely!  The problem is the large black label (see photo) that has a strong adhesive backing that is stuck to the scarf and cannot be removed without destroying the scarf.
This is prettier in the picture.
the colour is bad. :(
"Unlike the other Adidas that I have bought these are very tight on my feet. I'm a size 12 and my other shoes fit perfectly. Also, the tongue on both shoes are too narrow leaving a gap wide enough to see my socks. First time I've been dissatisfied with a purchase."
the toe box is way to narrow and i do not have wide feet at all. :\
RETURNING FOR A SIZE LARGER
Its not the product!! This guys they give me an another jumpsuit black!! Terrible!!  like a  halloween!!!
"Pretty, but didn't hold up to my 4 year old granddaughter and her 17 month old brother. The ribbon did not last, it frayed very quickly."
"These flips were pretty cheap looking, not what I expected.  The picture makes them look higher quality!"
The pants were at least 2 sizes too small and were sent without a packing/return slip so I am stuck with them.
"really cheap quality.  all three of the hats I ordered arrived crushed and the felt was so thin there really was no way to fix them and make them look good.
The return and refund process was smooth."
The jewels fell out within a month.
Size is much smaller than my other Landau pants this size.
Im a little smaller than a 1x so that is what I ordered. Way too small so a 3x would have to ordered and I would have reordered if when I took the pants out of the package the button fell off.  I own a lot of jeggings for health reasons and not one pair has ever had a zipper or button.
I must return these. Way too small compared to other brands.
I hate it.  Going in the donation bin.  I love how thin the material is but it is very tight in the arms.
Need to order size and half larger.
I have another pair of darn tough socks that are much better than this. This looks like a cheap knockoff
"a little small, but cute, the still work even if you can't wear them as knee socks"
"I do not have large calves, these are way too tight.  Too bad cause I like them, but I gave them away to a really thin person.  Kind of upset as I got them to deal with El Nino here in California.  Guess I will just just get some Wellies at a garden store that I can try on - but having had those before I know they will fit even if they are ugly."
"Arm holes are for a 7 year olds arms...
Giving it to my youngest daughter."
It's really tight...i can't wear it.
I thought this peasant top  was pretty cheap looking. The fabric was woven and very itchy and the trim just didn't lay right. Very disappointed
"i bought this item after reading all the good reviews and i was really happy when i received my shoes i liked the leather and the color  but when i tried it on i felt really disappointed .. i ordered size 10 when i always wear since more than 20 years , 10= 40 EUR this is what i always wear ,when i tried i on it was very big like size 11 or even 12 it even written on the shoes 10/41.5 ??? i was like ha!! a size and a half up ??? , when i contacted the sellers they were not helpful , although i explained my case to them,,, very disappointed"
Hard to adjust and thread belt into buckle.
Too bad!!!
"Defectve, i hope. Love running in this brand. First time in decades my feet and shins don't hurt while i run. But the pair i received were defective, i think. The seam inside at the arch, where the mizuno logo is sowed on was so rough i sent these shoes back, sadly."
"We bought this watch twice.  The first time was over the summer, and it worked great for three months (on an eight year old's arm).  Then, it stopped working.  I tried replacing the battery, and that did not fix the problem.  So I figured maybe ours was a dud (based on all of the great reviews for this watch) and there didn't seem to be a better or sturdier kid's watch available, so I ordered it again.  This time, the glow light never worked and the watch only made it a week before it stopped working!  I had thrown away all the guarantee information, assuming that surely I wouldn't get two bad ones in a row."
"Everything looked so promising.... put it on, winded it up, set it for the right time an it never stayed on time no matter how much i winded it or re set it.... it was a vary disappointing order, i just went back to my old watch an took this product as a loss... wish i could order from this company in the future but i already let most my peers know how bad an disappointing this product has left me.... thanks for the quality an style that was presented but it was not what i was expecting an now im left with a watch i cant use, don't want an cant wear.... Thanks for the speedy delivery though...."
"I wear a 6 and purchsed a 7. I can barely get my foot in, without socks.
seller expects you to pay to ship them back"
"These earrings look fantastic in the picture, but are very small and not what I pictured. Will not order jewelry from Amazon again!!"
"WAY short, waist is hard to keep up. returned"
"This is really really really really small, and it's an extra-large.  I wear a size 7 and 34b size so I'm not huge, but the extra large is too small for me and my tiny boobs.  It's more of a nightshirt, not a dress."
"Very pretty, but runs a little big. The wedding is too close to re-order with how long it takes to ship, so I will have to deal with it but I was disappointed."
"Giving it two stars cause its cute and seems well made. I ordered a medium and I was scared it would be too tight around my pregnant belly... well, it fits like an XL and Im really disappointed. See pictures for example."
The size is good but not the quality. It ripped before the wedding got here.
"This is a nice coat.  I got the purple, which was a bit too bright for my taste, but no big deal.  I am between an M and an L for winter coats but I read some reviews that it runs small so I bought XL which floats on me.  When trying to exchange it, I discovered I have to pay for the postage back to the UK, which was around $32 - more than the price of the coat.  Too bad....I'm going to donate it to our local Goodwill store.  So this is one thing to keep in mind if you are in-between sizes and may need to return or exchange."
"These are heavy-ish. Does not look like they picture. Clips are not sturdy and the crystal is very dark, not rose gold at all. Seems more brown."
Would have loved these if they weren't so narrow. . Nice quality shoes but just couldn't get my feet in them. I normally take a 10w or 11...I bought the 11 but it didn't do it for me. Too bad.  They went back.
"leather feels very wet, very slippery, and extreme bad smell leather.  smell imprint on your hands.

Cards does not fold into pocket side of Wallet, the slide is small and very tight."
These shirts are so thin you could fold one double and still read the Wall Street Journal thru it! I doubt they will last through a half dozen washings!
"Do not order if you expect these to fit.  I usually wear a 22/24 in tops, so ordered a 3x - these fit more like a Large (way too small).  The fabric was stiff.  Instead of these, have a look at the Joe's USA, Dickies or Lee's polo shirts.  I've found all three of those to be a better fit and way softer."
"I'm 6'2"" and 230 Lbs and don't think my dreams would fit in the largest size."
Returned for poor fit
Size was way to narrow.  Not sure whose foot they would fit.
"I am 5'2"" 115lbs 26.5"" waist C cup, yet this shirt doesn't fit the way it looks in the picture. I'm never going to wear it, so that was a waste of money. I wouldn't recommend buying this no matter what size you pick. I bought a small yet it was too big around the torso too small on the boobs to tight on the waist. Probably meant for a funny shaped mannequin real women can't wear this."
Case of you get what you pay for. Looked nice in pkg but snapped into two orders when tried to put it on. Guessing it had a flaw but not worth hassle to return it.
I have always worn a size 5 and a half. The foot part of the sandal is more than big enough to accommodate my foot. It's the lacing above that is so close to the Sandal bottom that I can't even slide my foot into it. Another friend who is a size 5 even smaller than I am could not fit her put into it either due to the straps making it impossible. I'm so bummed that I can't even get these On My Feet. I feel really ripped off quite honestly.
"Terrible quality, it looks so cheap. One sleeve was tighter than the other. It also had a whole in the shoulder."
"Gift for girlfriend: she thought they were cute, but ultimately they are just too bulky to actually be wearable and she threw them away."
Battery lasted 2 months from when I got it.
"Didn't like these pants at all. Material felt like cardboard and they make all kinds of noise when you move in them. The overall cut of the pants are like a pair of baggy clown pants. I'm 5'-7' and the large are about 8"" to long for me. The zippers are plastic and hard to work in fact one leg they would work onetime and the next try they would stick and not zip. I sent them back ! Needless to say I don't recommend these."
"I bought another waist ""snipper"" - same size, which fit perfectly - this one rolls down at the top, and folds up at the bottom. This one, while I like that there's no closure, just didn't fit the way I wanted it to. Sad - it was a good price!"
Two stones fell off right out of the box
"This is a newly designed travel wallet unlike their old one. Be aware of this if you are buying it as a replacement. The older unit (purchased Nov. 2016) I love. Sadly the new model is missing a zippered pocket on the right hand side.(see image- the new wallet is the one with the pen) In addition the credit card slots are too deep on the new wallet and you cannot see the tops of the cards. The image I took I have cards in the new wallet but they are not visible. The image seller shows in the description is not accurate in that credit cards can't be seen when put in the slots. Please be aware of this issue as it's a major drawback. The material inside the new wallet also makes noise (crinkles) that the old style didn't.
My old Agilisk wallet I love so much I carry it daily. It has long outlived the trip I purchased it for. I was hoping to replace it but now I'm sticking with my old Agilisk and just repaired the small issue with it. I am hoping they will change back to the old design. The very least they need to do is fix the credit card slot issue."
"i got the regular ones for my blue boots, and had to split the back seam to get them to fit. these have a 2"" gap between my calf and the fabric. so they look awful. the split back seam is a way better look. not to mention these make me look like i have cankles when i do not. i plan to cut these down and turn into ankle booties, but not everyone has that ability."
"I was disappointed with these sandals and sent them back.  I've bought many Clark products, and they usually fit well and provide good support/ These were poor fitting with wide heel ends, although not marked or boxed as large."
the sole treads wear out too fast and become hazardous when walking on a wet paved surface
"Fit well, lots of toe room, but both pair had a lump, bump, or rise in center of my foot on each pair, across from the ball of my foot in the middle. I tried another insole, same thing. Put them on without a insole, and still felt the rise or bump. It was in the sole. If it was not for that, I would have kept them. Also leather was very dark. Almost black looking. Darker than picture on listing. Not a problem for me."
"Disappointed...I'm 5'4 and 115lbs, with a small waist. The large stone is HUGE and did not fit in my navel. The description also said it was adjustable, which it is NOT. I ended up throwing it in the trash because I ruined it trying to make the shaft shorter."
"My hubby bought them for me,the nice and warm,but I found them not comfortable enough for me,but I am picky when it comes to shoes ,got a pair of Bear Paws and it's much better."
"Was to let down with this suit. I was planning on going to the beach for the first time since having kids (I had my first 6yrs ago')...and because I am not the 110lbs 5'8 woman I was before having kids I knew I'd need to cover up but I still wanted to feel good...sexy possibly even. I ordered this with high hopes..and when it arrived, I couldn't try it on fast enough.
  I weigh about 165-175lbs at any given time...and ordered an XL....it was gigantic in the bust (I'm a double full D) tight in the thighs to the point I had marks, the belly area bagged but was tight at the same time, It was awful. I then got the next size down and that was like packing 20lbs of sausage into 10lbs wrapper, and that's when I gave up on it. Never the less I have still yet to get a suit I feel good and confidant in enough to go to a beach,,"
It looks cheap! I wear a 10 but ordered 11 so it's a bit big but ok.
These are ginormous - more like culottes for guys - they hit well below the knee and I am a tall guy.
Was not what I expected. Very comfortable keep your feet warm
"Laughably bad. Like other reviewers, I received the product with all hardware sown backwards onto the suspender straps. So the soft yellow side is outward and the harder tan side is turned inward. If you want yellow suspenders, these are great. If however you want what you ordered, pick another product."
Cute style too bad it was too small
If I could give it a zero rating I would
Not Bendable..... seemed plastic.
"The color is beautiful and shipping much quicker than expected considering they come from Asia, but the toe of this shoe is NARROW. I wanted to love them, and I will keep them because I don't want the hassle of sending them back, but I just don't like the look. I would say my foot is average; not narrow but certainly not wide and while I'm sure they will stretch as others have indicated, they just don't look right.  I tried to attach a picture but somehow it wouldn't come through so to give you an idea, the tip of this size 8 measures in at 1 1/2 inch while the widest part of my foot in this shoe measures 3 1/2""....you get the idea."
Shoulders are puffier than expected just not as flattering as I hoped for
The Jeans are ok although the material seems much thinner than normal and size runs small. The main problem is I ordered two pair and its been over 100 days and the second pair has not arrived. Canceling that part of the order now.
Doesnt look nice like the picture. Bow fell off when I took it out of bag. Material is a rough linen and wrinkles easily. I will keep and try to soften with fabric softner. Wont order from this company again
Pitiful don't began to describe this. A hole was in the ring. It is black!! Customer service sucked. Never ever again.
Omg were to start!! This peace of junk only has pegs that come across when u move or breath!!! It needs hooks or clips!! Complete trash I just threw it away!!
"honestly, I am not sure I even received the same product.  the lines seem different."
shoe is probably good they just run small.
order like 2 sizes  larger
"Firstly these boots are clearly the high quality you would expect from UGG. The leather and craftsmanship is sublime and they look very classy and stylish, timeless Chelsea boots here for sure. The bottom has a great grip tread but somehow manages to look steam line and not clunky in the slightest. For looks and craftsmanship these are five star all the way.
However.....a number of points cause me to sadly have to return these
1. Like a few other reviewers mention, they are strangely narrow in the heel which makes them quite a feat to just get on for that reason alone, yet for myself anyways this wasn't a painful issue, slipping them on will never be easy
2. I have regular width feet, bordering on narrow yet these are painfully narrow and scrunch your toe bones up so your feet click and crunch when you walk. One foot was worse than the other.
3. Sizing up is not a possibility realistically. Yes, Sizing up will give a little extra room at the length but they are not going to get wider and these are so narrow that wearing even the thinnest socks is impossible. I fear the extra length will just make them even more uncomfortable since now they are too tight width wise and they will slip and rub at the heel. Accounting for extra room by wearing thicker socks just can't happen with these

I would say if you have very narrow feet then these will work wonderfully for you.
I would say if your a sadist and are prepared to go through the torture of wearing them long enough to stretch the leather our enough to be comfortable then go for it.
Real shame, cause these are gorgeous on"
"No problem with calf fit, but I'm small. Ordered a 6 on a smokin' deal on Ebay. They just were not comfortable being too long for me. Wore them 2 or 3 times and just sold them on Ebay. I advertised them as being a 6, but fitting more like a 6.5 and provided measurements. Made me leery of the brand because of the size issue. Quality of leather is okay."
"eye lit busted off on first lacing, returned."
"It is just my personal opinion but when this came with some wrong items, I felt it looked gaudy and cheap looking."
"I've been on the hunt for leggings for awhile, and with all the positive reviews, had high hopes for these. To be upfront, I prefer high-waisted leggings with softer waist bands. These were tight with an uncomfortable waist band. It dug into my skin. The material also wasn't very soft."
"These were too short and very uncomfortable. No padding at all inside, too bad cause they are very cute."
These look like clown pants I wear a 36 waist I ordered a 36 waist. I would need a 32 waist for them to fit! I'm 6' 215 lbs
"Sadly, I didn't return this before 30 days was up,  but I was very disappointed in this wrap. It was very thin and lacked any fullness represented in the image. Not worth 12 dollars."
So extremely tiny. Not made for curves or women worth hips our chest at all
I returned these and went up a half size. Small both in length and width.
It's super cute....but I sneezed once and it broke....
"Don't purchase if you have sensitive ears it will cause a reaction. My ears turned bright red, probably from nickel, and hurt after a day of wearing these. Probably fine for those without sensitive ears though."
"It's just that there were reviewers that loved the boots, couldn't wait to get them in another color, etc.  Color, however, is the problem .... well, that and quality. I was prepared for getting what I paid for, and since they were a gift for a middle schooler whose shoes last a maximum of a few months anyway, I could live with that. But the color? It's advertised as yellow, and further as neon yellow. Just what my granddaughter wanted, so you can imagine her disappointment when the boots turned out to be not neon yellow, but .... green. Neon green. I thought perhaps it was the light deceiving me when I opened the box last night, so I waited until I could take them outside in the natural light today. Nope. Green. Green as green can be, so if you're looking for neon green (you know, to match your Seattle Seahawks gear), by all means order these boots. If you want yellow, look elsewhere."
"I normally wear size 14-16. I ordered an XL,the scrubs really fit with no room for those""bloating days"".The material is cheap,you must iron these scrubs. However both pieces were less than 20.00,which is great. I have washed them 3 times(no color changes).Package arrived on time."
"I ordered these for a Doctor Who party and they came really quickly, but they don't look like the one in the picture. The tassel is much shorter and the shape is more domed on the top. For what I'm using it for and for the cost, it's fine, but if you want something more realistic, pay a little more and get something of a higher quality."
It's very lightweight and thin. Sizing is also very big for me.
Looks more like a maternity blouse and it unraveled when worn
leather is hard and the strap does't look good.
"Shirt fabric is great, soft, washed well. The logo had a hair going through it and cracks after every wash. So that sucks."
"too small, its fitted for the folk who makes it"
"I have at least 50 crocs. All colors and styles. Crocs are comfortable, and can be worn all day. This particular pair were marked with the right size but we're way too large. I think the manufacturer must have put them in the wrong bin. Having said that, Amazon is absolutely wonderful in returns so if that would happen again, u have no problem with a return."
"I like the looks and simplicity of this watch. Its everything I thought it would be spending less than $35. Two things that annoy me about it... 1. the most obvious, how loud it ""ticks"". I have wall clocks that are quieter than this little watch. I have been kept awake at night by how loud this thing is.  2. I guess I have skinny wrists and the strap this came with barely fits my wrist. For example, the strap wraps all the way around to almost touch the other side to the top of the watch."
Zipper was broken so could not even wear for halloween
"very cheap material,  but did not have any problems returned it"
I really disliked this scarf because it was very bad quality and very difficult to return
"I ordered the same watch in silver and loved it, so I decided to order the rose gold too.  After removing a couple links to make it fit, I tried the watch on and realized it didn't work.  I set it and the second hand started ticking, but only lasted a few seconds, got stuck, and stopped moving.  It was cheap enough I didn't bother sending it back, but instead used the parts to fix my first watch when the pin broke."
Very rough texture. Would not order again
Looks very cheap. Returning.
So I got this for my wife along with some other charms for her Pandora bracelet. The color started eroding in about 3.5 months.
Nope don't like them. Return if could but missed deadline.  Goodwill pile
Get this raincoat and still get wet.
Colour fade with one wash
"The sizing is not true to size.  I ordered a 4X because I read a review that said the clothing sizes ran small.  The true size would be more like either a M or L - not a 2X like I was hoping for.

However, that said, I did like the quality and color of the top."
"the belt isn't as pictured, the belt shown is brown but what I got was so dark I cant tell if its black or what, but definitely not brown."
"I ordered these for my husband because they were advertised as LARGE, but they don't even fit me. They are so small that they are actually comfortable on my 4yr old son (he does not have a big head). I wish I could still return them."
I'm giving this a one star because it  reeked of cigarette smoke. The fact it was WAY too small is just an unfortunate reality. The coat is super warm and soft and looks great on...
"This has to be the worst product I have ever bought off Amazon.  The boots were covered in a yellow chemical staining that I guess is used to antique the boots.  No one bothered to remove all the excess chemicals and it was so badly caked on that I did not dare try to make them look decent.  Under all the chemical staining was probably a very nice boot.  The leather smelled great and they felt nice but just a poor job at the factory and inspection team.  I quickly returned.
The boot also ran smaller than the Justin 13D's I tried on in the store.  My toes felt like an overstuffed can of sardines.  :-)"
"These shorts are a weird fabric that truly highlight moisture. The charcoal grey looks almost black anywhere the smallest amount of sweat contacts it. They looked absolutely gross at the end of my workout. I have never had this issue before, and will never wear these shorts again."
Bad sizing.
I was never able to get the atomic clock to update. I tried every location and direction.  Returned the watch.
"I bought these shower shoes for travel. They are well made, but too heavy for my purpose. I returned them."
"I ordered this ring so I didn't have to wear my real diamond everyday in fear of losing it.  This ring gets delivered and it pretty and shiny, but it looks very cheap and fake. I had big expectations for this ring and shouldn't have!"
"They are cheap priced and cheap made.  Mine fell apart at the top seam on the first hike.  Tossed them in the fire.  Buy leather, I am."
All the time am wear  size 33W but this pant very wrong size not come 30 even And I  bay 3 pice from theme this the problem
Returned this item because the fit is too small.
Beautiful on the  model - not so great on me- will be returning -
The skirt pictured and the description states it is a BLACK skirt... but what I got was a black & white polka dot skirt ....YUK!  I gave it two stars because the price was okay and the shipping was fast.  But this one is on it's way back.  This skirt runs SMALL and is VERY short !  If you really like it I would order a size up.
Cheap and sewed wrong! Don't waste your money!!!!
Key broke in shipment. Item is ok for the money. I love the peacock heart charm on it. It is not the fanciest thing. Also just a heads up order this early if you are looking to buy it for a gift.
These might be fine for young boys but they run way to small for adult men who work out. NO WAY this is a true XXL.
These are soooo low cut in the front that only wore them once. It almost feels like there isn't really a front to them. Maybe these could work for someone with a very short-waist type figure.
"Poor quality, runs really small - Men's L fits like Women's S - avoid."
"I ordered a size Large, which I wear comfortably.  These were super tight and I'm guessing would have shrunk when I washed them.  I also thought the straps were chintzy.  They were ribbon-like, which wasn't in itself a reason for me to return them. However, they were the length I was looking for."
too large to be fit
"I bought 2 size mediums. They would fit if I was 6'6""."
BEAUTIFUL dress - 'VERY SMALL
Not warm or durable.
These were way too big and bulky for my head. I don't have a lot of hair to begin with but I thought these would still look good and give a little pizzazz  to by boring work look. And it probably would have if these things would have stayed on and not been falling down so much that I constantly pushed them back up with them sitting too high on my head. It was a mess all around.
I could wrap it around w pencil but it still wouldn't be cute
Reminds me of the material of my great grandmother's pants. Fits odd.
These were super cheap and left my ear green. I went on szul.com and found cheaper but better pearl studs.
They were made weird. The toe was so skinny and the heel was so big. I have wanted these for so long. I was dissapointed. Had to send back.
this is the second time I've placed an order for two pair of these Docker slacks and both times the inseam was 1 inch shorter than the slax were marked.....send Amazon a note requesting they confirm the integrity of the size before they sent me a replacement slacks.....that didn't happen as well.....
"No give at all.  Made from denim like material with absolutely no stretch.  If you are looking for typical Dockers big and tall fit, look somewhere else."
"Had grease all over it. Had to throw away.
Update. Received new one. Absolutely love it. Ordered it in 3 more colors!! So soft and comfortable and very flattering
Now I highly recommend it!!!"
I brought these base off the reviews. I wear a size 8M but I should have ordered a 8.5. The shoes was very tight & very uncomfortable I had to return them. The return & refund  process was very smooth.
"The fabric is very thick and lined with an even thicker fabric. I am a solid 3x, ordered the 3x, and it was tight. Too hot, too thick, and too tight. sending it back"
Quality not so good
YELLOW
just threw it out to the trash. Never choose it. Poor quality and looks much worse than at a pic. Different length of stripes and chains.
Got these glasses and had horrible scratch on right lens.. Amazon is great on returns but quality assurance of this company sucks as it was  packaged really nice with a good sunglass hard case. I was really disappointed! Would not recommend !
You get what you pay for. This turban is far thinner than I thought it would be and rather flimsy. I don't anticipate ordering any more.
Very small almost Asian size did not fit at all but just too much trouble to send it back.  I gave it to my friend who wears a size zero and it fit her perfectly.
nice belt but too small...returned it but upon checking...there is no record of it arriving....used the UPS label provided
"I had to return this dress, the bottom layer was too puffy and made my hips look even bigger than they are.  It was not flattering for my body shape."
I wear an 8 and these were an 8-1/2 and still WAY too small.  Not sized correctly.  Cute shoe if you order two sizes larger than you wear!
to tight around the angles
Not uswful
Fit much smaller than expected - had to return the dress.
"Quality of zip is s***ty! It does look like two side zip, but there no chance to open it. Very rough zip. Completely trashy one("
I thought the jeggings would be a little thicker but I was wrong!  I  will give away for a Christmas gift.
"I wore it for a week and the pants inseam already split in the front by a inch. I cannot wear the pants now. The material is soft but it's not worth it if it splits less than a week of wearing it. I bought another scrub set from a different company and their scrubs, although 1 size too big, is sturdy."
"The set would be a decent one to take to a cruise if not the quality of making.  I ordered one in white.  I followed the suggested sizing guide and it the set fits o.k.  The seams were uneven, the skirt was not even symmetrical, the seams would have to be repaired if I keep the set, but I returned it.  The set includes 3 items.  The third is a light strapless bra wrapped in a polyester fabric that is usually used for lining. The bra was not comfortable but would be o.k. if the rest is fine."
"Glasses obscured vision, and were a poor fit."
Dont waste your money.
This underwear are cut very small! I don't think you can exchange underwear or I would! Now I have to re-order and pay AGAIN for an item I cannot use.
thick heavy material with no give. beautiful color but mildly uncomfortable to wear
Product didn't fit as expected
"I have a small torso, am 34 A, normally wear an XS or a size 0. I didn't really like how this fit my chest - I felt like it wasn't tight enough or that my cups didn't fill it out enough. I ordered a size S/M, and heard from other reviewers with similar sizing to me that they loved and it fit great; wasn't the case for me. I also felt like the strip running from the chest to the bikini area was too loose. If you're a B cup, and maybe have a more normal-length torso or longer, you'll fit this perfectly. It's very pretty lace, and everything is sewn on securely - looks like high-quality lingerie. But for really tiny ladies... look for something else.

As a side note, I ordered the product pictured (the mainly-red lace with black accents) - and they sent me the other one (the black lace with very small red accents). When it came it did not look as pictured. Maybe the red lace would have fit a little differently... not sure.

**P.S. I called Amazon about it and they were super good at taking care of me. Thanks Amazon for great customer service!!"
"The hooks, top and bottom, come undone constantly. It rides up the back of my neck in a weird way."
"Its somewhat hard to put on because it fits kind of tight. This is normally my size and it makes me feel like I have to hold my breath to wear. It looks nice though, one of those shirts that makes a woman feel like she goes through a lot of stuff to be beautiful."
I wear XL.  Because of what others said I ordered XXL.  It's still too small.
Straps broke on both in less than 2 mo. These are flimsy and not like reefs I have bought before.
I dunno who makes these shoes.  But having a sole that's 15 percent of the width of the actual shoe is ridiculous.  I ordered a size 13 and I don't know anyone that has a 13 with and extra narrow width .  Doesn't make sense. I put my foot in it and it looked like the shoe was ready to explode
I was excited about this raincoat because I needed one for work. I could have saved myself the $20 because I got soaked anyway. This coat is soooo thin and NOT AT ALL waterproof. I was wearing it in moderate rain for about 45 mins-1 hour and the rain soaked through. I ended up with wet clothes regardless. I was so disappointed. I ordered a large and it fit like so. I wear usually wear a small but wanted something loose fitting.
"already gave one review but its on my list for reviews again?? odd ..
Its a miscut to the right shoulder..pulls when I put it on ...bummer
has to go back ..
LOVE the Sherpa , design and warmth
returning"
"It was a doll size, if I was that small I would not have to waist my money, I was a size five do to prolong steroids for my illness, it's giving me the belly and do to surgeries I am not allowed to go to d gym.  Like I said, I spend a lot of money n ready to stop"
Way Way too large and bulky.  I sent this back
I ordered a size 39 and received a 36. Very disappointed. Will return but I am doubtful of re-purchasing.
They didn't fit the way I wanted to so I didn't end up wearing them. I gave them to another family member.
"I loved the skirt the minute I saw it and I just had to order me one. So, when I finally got it, i was very ddisappointed. This skirt looks like a skeleton skirt! Not zebra. Not flattering at all."
Not comfortable at all to me. Feel like cheaply made socks. They are the right size but I want something more. I do not recommend and I hope this helps.
Did not like the way the buckle attaches to a best.
Beautiful watch but poorly made. Was so excited until I tried setting the timw and the second hand fell off. Disappointment.  Dont recommend this.
"It looks as described but the your leather band must not be very thick or else it can't be fit with the clasp. If you have one of those thin crocodile strap then it probably can be fitted, otherwise most band cannot be fit with it."
Did not match the description in the ad. Way too small
These flip flops are nicely made and look like they would hold up well. They have great arch support too.  My sister swears that they are the most comfortable flip flops around.  I have a wide toe box so I got the unisex flip flops based on my sisters recommendation.  they are too floppy for my wide foot.  the sole of the shoe is the correct width but the upper canvas straps are too loose.  I regret that I will be sending them back.
"First off - I'm 5'3"" and 140 lbs. so I'm not in the best shape of my life but the size is just weird... I felt it was big on me which I figured since I'm on the higher end of the scale, it would fit a little more snug. It doesn't flatter - it just hangs off of you. The model in the picture has to be smaller than me and it fits bigger on me than her. I'm sure they pinned or clipped it in the back.  I'm just unimpressed with this - especially since it had relatively good reviews."
"Absolutely love them, super comfy....however after 2 washes, they started pulling apart at the seams...."
I am 5`0 and 113 lbs. It's a little bit tight. But that's ok to me. The thing I don't like is the stitches and it's quite funny how they made it. Don't get me wrong I like the cut of this dress.
"Didn't know this crocs is different from the other type they have.  apparently this one has much shallower profile than the regular crocs.  didn't fit my son's feet, we ended up giving it away."
2nd one I ordered and still a little small. I know son is a large. ordered XL and still to small.
"One of the worst purchases I ever made. They had a run in them first time I put them on due to my fingernail (which are square shaped) crating a little tear since they are just like pantyhose. Next time I'll have to wear gloves. Other than that they did keep everything in place and the high waist is the way to go so you don't have the ""back"" fat. But like I mentioned before, they are just nylons with the tightened tummy."
Beautiful color but it's very big.
Shoes did not come exactly how they are pictured. Almost like they are knockoffs
"Material is fine, but is sized too small. It is not a comfortable fit.  I ordered it from the same company, but it is a different name brand than the other shirt."
This was just a wierd fitting piece of underwear.  Also it doesnt prevent your thighs from rubbing when you work out
ITS A BEAUTIFUL WELL MADE DRESS BUT IT MEDIUM ITS LIKE SIZE 0 OR 2. TAKE LONG TIME ALSO TO CAME. I DID ASK FOR ANOTHER ONE XXL BECAUSE IS VERY WELL MADE AND I REALLY LIKE IT.
elastic is not right and fabric is too shiny.
"These are small and narrow and the fur lining is thin.  We love Bearpaw Ugg knock offs, but the slippers are not good quality."
Poor qualitt
its cute but at least two full sizes small
"It looked great when received but after a few weeks the strap of the right foot flip flop started to tear apart, like it has been worn for ages.  Very disappointed with the quality for that price! I wear very sturdy Vionic flips outside and I was looking for something cheaper for the house but better paying twice the price and have sandals of durable quality. Or I will buy new Reef flip flops because the ones I just threw away lasted for years!"
As much as I like these there is no possible way that I can leave a good review.
Very disappointed.  Ordered a 3x and it's equivalent to a size 12.  I gave it away. Color and quality were fine.
"Usually love Fila, but they need to get a better factory in China ;) JT

Super cheaply made. When you lifted up the velcro strrap, the fabric lifted up and was not even sewn\

They were also about 2 sizes too small.

The 2 stars are for comfort when you slip them on."
"Idea is great and might work for some, but not for a 34D. It held nothing in place because the fit was completely off."
didn't fit right for me. not my style
There are no drain holes on the pockets.  Didn't notice until I just jumped in my pool and got out with 2 BIG balloons.  Going back.  I also bought the Speedo brand.  The speedo trunks are much better quality and have drain holes.
I wish there was a way to select only one color.  I really wanted just grey and black.  I got lime green.  Sorry I am just not a lime green person.  I returned them and did not even open the package.
"holes after very few washes, felt like I sweated more in them"
"I purchased these shoes to wear to thru-hike the Long Trail in Vermont, I specifically picked them out because they're light and claim to be waterproof.
The second day on the trail water seeped right through and my shoes got soaked from normal wet trail wear. They were in no way water resistant. And the rubber on the front started separating from the cloth on both shoes after a week.
I used to have a pair of keens that lasted me over 1000 miles before anything like this happened. I wish I would have just stuck with the keens."
"Beautiful dress, but it wasn't  for me t this time. But I have some fat also to loose around the middle section"
"Updated review, 11/23/14:
------------
after having these shoes for less than a year, and wearing them casually and lightly for parts of winter, spring and now the fall of 2014, I'm sorely disappointed in their quality.  The shoes are already showing grossly excessive deterioration of the tread on both shoes, having lost numerous lugs on the rear third of both shoes.

Subsequent to purchasing, I found out that these shoes are made by Wolverine, the very same company that bought what was once a great brand of shoes in Merrell, and ruined them.  I've had three pairs of Merrell Chameleon Prime Stretch shoes in the last two months that have had such poor quality soles/treads that have become unglued and/or lost lugs in less than three weeks wearing, that I will never buy another Wolverine family product again.

I think the US Federal Government needs to prosecute this company for putting out shoddy products and charging top dollar for products that fail.  With the technology that exists today, there's not excuse for shoes that are worn lightly, in less than one year's time, losing chunks of the tread.  I've had shoes that have lasted me 5+ years that have never lost tread like Wolverine products do.

---------------------------------------------------------------
I find the Shelk to be a great all-around comfortable shoe that while running a half to full-size larger than other shoes, is excellent for the money and a far better value than its cousins in the Merrell line.  So far the shoe is proving durable in the two months I have owned it and hope it stays that way.  I might well buy 2-3 pairs for saving, in case they stop making it."
They don't stay on your ears. Will be returning them.
If you have full breasts small or large be happy don't bother with paddings. These were not designed for us I ordered my correct size and It didn't even cover my nipples
"The size fit... but they are incredibly uncomfortable! I am returning them. Too bad, they are so pretty!"
Great belt but Velcro is weak and has ripped already.
This thing shrunk like a motherfather.  It was way too big and then after one wash (warm water) and one dry (med heat)  it fits more like a Medium.  I would get a different shirt.
I bought this pair of boots as a Christmas present. My daughter wore them about 6-7 times when the heel of one boot cracked and fell apart. She can't wear these in the snow or rain now as her foot rapidly gets wet.
"Love it, just can't wear it. Ordering bigger size from lindy bop"
"Man when you takes these out of the shipping the feel like butter on bread but with one wash they shrink way more than expected, I had to give them to my wife and trust me there is a huge size difference between us, Im 220 she is 130"
"I ordered a size large, but should have ordered a size medium.  The pants are very comfortable, but WAY too long.  i think it's probably at least 36 inches, so it drags on the floor.  My inseam is about 30.5 inches, so keep in mind you may need to alter it if you decide to purchase it.

Another thing that happened is the seam at the crotch started coming apart.  I don't think these are very well made.  I had to resew them. Because of their construction, I'm downgrading it one star,"
"I order everything I wear in a size Large and never really have issues. This however is not a true large. It is more like a medium. I had trouble getting it on and when i did finally manage to squeeze in it, i didn't have any space to move. I couldn't even walk. I wanted to exchange it for an XL but the company decided to reimbursement a partial amount instead. I paid $11.69 with $3.99 in shipping and handling. I thought the company said they would reimburse me for the everything minus the shipping and handling but instead the reimbursed me $4.00. I didn't put up a big fuss because it was inexpensive. This cover up is really cute but be sure to order on size up."
"You get what you pay for and in this instance you could pay only a little more and get much better.  The sole is very hard, does not flex and is slippery, just as other reviews mentioned.  The opening is tight around calf and not able to wear jeans tucked inside very comfortably.  I can see why the boot separates from the sole.  Like the height of the boot but disappointed that I paid what I did and could have found the boot at a retail store for about the same price and have a better boot for a bit more money.  Don't purchase these."
These do not fit close to the lens of glasses. Poor design!
"I really wanted to love this dress I did. I purchased this dress for a funeral. After reading all the reviews decided to go for it. Only problem I had was my breast 40D at the moment didn't fit at all. This might be my fault as I just had twins a month ago but thought if I ordered the XXL it could work. Boy was I wrong, I'll have to give it a while before I try again with this dress, maybe for a better occasion."
Seems were coming apart
Returned because shoes ran much too small.
"Much too large, despite the fact that I'm a pretty big girl"
Terrible synthetic nylon material. Not at all as depicted as far as how it looks.
Im 5'2 122bs this dress stop at my butt cheeks I was so disappointed I was expecting it to be short but not that short. If your looking for something really SHORT this is dress for you. The dress is gorgeous but its too short for me.
"Super cute and perfect sized, but broke in the 1st month."
"Just don't get how I wear a 9.5 4E in two different New Balance styles and I order these in that size and they are too small and tight.  I'm sure the shoe is decent overall, but I just don't get the sizing issue."
"Yes it fit but I think it's kind of a stretch to call it ""one size"". I think on a smaller girl, it would have looked better and that was disappointed. Especially because I am not very big. I normally wear a size 10-12 so I feel like one size should at least fit that.  For the price it was decent, but I wouldn't recommend this. It just looks awkward."
"Not quite as expected, even though it costs about the same as the baton or cuffs alone the cuffs would not stay locked even with no weight on them other then their own thus you can not attach them to anything.  Everything is plastic.  I did not use the badge since it is bad and the fake radio is too flimsy so it can not even be mounted to uniform/costume."
Going to donate to needy.
"The reviews said these run small, so I purchased a medium to be safe. The top was skin tight, as in I could hardly get it on, and the bottoms fit fine. That's bad, because I'm pear-shaped, so it should be the other way around. Also, the bottoms are REALLY high-waisted. I'll have to send these back. I can't imagine these would fit anybody properly."
"There is a wood chunck coming up in the boot on the heel, can't even wear"
"I just wanted a pair of shorts that I could wear on the deck while watering my MMJ plants. So I bought four of these and, when they arrived, I tried one on. It reminded me of the time when I was in Ireland and needed to buy some new underwear.

So I went down to Dunns Store and bought a package. They fit me like Speedos. Although it was fun dancing around in the living room to my wife's chagrin, I did, indeed, look like a fool. Sometime in life thongs should only be worn on the feet.

Well I do peal these things on and tip toe out to the deck now on sunny days when no one is looking and they do fit just dandy but all things considered, I think I should have stayed with the golf shorts."
these are good looking but there is no padding or cushion for the ball of the foot. also toe box is very narrow.
See it looks like it has some sort of structure to it. But its just soft and more of a poly blend cardigan
The baggy fit is good but the material is rather grandma-ish. Cheap polyester.
Was supposed to be assorted colors  They were all grey other then that  good
"The product is good quality but was not what I was looking for. If you want a stylish hat don't buy it. It's more of a practical use hat, I wear it skiing."
"I have reduced rating to one star for one reason.  I received the shoes in record time, a tribute to Amazon.  Having said that, I received the shoes and they fit reasonably well, except, the company omitted putting in the inner sole liners.  The insides of the shoes have all the threads showing that gives an uneven feel due to the leather flaps from the sides sewn to the soles making the shoes uncomfortable.  Had to buy some Dr. Schols liners to fix the factory problem.  I guess they don't have quality control inspectors in communist countries that make these things."
Suit runs very small there was an issue with the zipper and they wanted me to pay for returning
"It fits oddly. Hangs far too low off shoulders and exposes chest. However, the material is light and cool. If I were to wear it to the gym I believe it would be fine."
"Most certainly not legitimate. Huge waste of time, but at least I got my money back. If you want to save a few bucks and you are sure no one else will ever handle them, no one will ever know."
"not for wide feet, but otherwise super cute!"
"Very cute pants, were just too small.  The review is not for the pants but for the return of the pants.  I don't know what is going on but I am being charged for pants I no longer have.  I sent them back in the same package with the liverpool pants but they said they only got the liverpool pants back.  So how on earth did they get one pair and not the other if they were in the same package."
Size was not as expected!  Very disappointed.  WWWAAAAAYYY too small!!
Fits properly. But is extremely painful. Order a size larger to save yourself the discomfort. Or remove the plastic bones on the back.
"The product that I received was not the same product pictured.. The plaid was red and navy blue, not black. And it seemed to be made out of very cheap, thin material with a noticeable seam running right down the middle in the front."
"they were very nice looking boots but it was impossible for me to get my foot into them.
I ordered a 12m which is the same size I have worn for the last 30 years, lhe neck of the was too tight to get my foot into the boot. I returned them"
"The color is not as it appears in the picture. I found the sizing to be off. Worst of all, the flannel was thinner than I was expecting but VERY SCRATCHY. Check out the Dickie's brand for better quality and softer material."
Too big Too big looks like glass looks fact big as my finger post too small to hold secure and up right
Not crazy about these earrings. Too small and kinda cheesy. Cheap enough though. I just don't have pierced ears yet so I keep trying to find decent looking clipons... Guess I'm still looking.
"Poorly made, mine was broken when I received it. It may look like the one you can get at the Halloween store or walmart, etc but its very poorly made. Picture is not at all the same."
"The shorts came but they were much too big. Reading the reviews I thought that a 26 would fit me but when they came, they were too big and baggy all around. The shorts looked cute when they were not on my body but the fit of them was not what I had hoped for. The size chart was not good as well."
"The shoe was too stiff and not at all up to ""FitFlop"" standards of comfort.  I returned them."
"They claim it is 925 silver, well it it is not. I had to sent it back, first time worn it faded to a black metal. The description is not true, don't get fooled."
"They fall out easily, seem to be smaller than a 2 gauge."
They were too wide in the heel.
Very pretty but fell apart after a month.
"Fabric cut wrong, pleat starts in front, then turns to the inside. First time disappointed with Haggar!"
Looks very cheap.  I wanted natural stone instead of CZ but there is little to no sparkle with white topaz.  The center stone is abnormally large compared to the other stones.  They are totally see through.  Even the metal looks cheap.  Go with CZ instead.
"The design is a parakeets, the fabric is chiffon."
"I was looking for a comfortable walking shoe that is rainproof. When I tried it on one foot, I felt immediate pain in the back tendon that goes down to the ankle. I thought maybe there was something left in there, but nothing there. I think the back seam of the shoe was jamming into my back tendon there or I just got a bad pair."
I didn't know anything about Synthetic Leather before hand. This is basically a brown plastic band. I've returned it.
The sizing for this company is not accurate at all. Had to return the item - way too big.
Way too small. This is NOT an accurate size for Plus sized women.
No shape at all. I will not wear this.
Size chart was useless. Waaaaaaay too small.
Turns wrist green then you can smell it when it turns horrible
I was extremely disappointed with this costume. It has Velcro in the back and the points of the upper part of the sleeves were all bent out of shape. The only thing that was good about it was the head piece. I do not recommend this product if you want it to look like the picture.
Not ribbed. Got xxl. Way too small. I am an xl/xxl size 16/18.
My son wears a size 3-4 depending on the shoes. I thought a 3 boot would be fine. Most boots I order run big. Not these! I had my youngest son try them on. He wears a 12 and these were NOT huge. These would be great for a size 1 so order up 2 sizes.
"Shorts are not bad, BUT BEWARE: They run very SMALL, even before washing. I didn't dare wear or wash them. I would recommend without hesitation that you order a size larger. I'm a big guy but not fat. I bought an XL, which is basically what I always wear.
The shorts look and feel to tight for shorts of this style. I like the basic idea of shorts. Another downside, there are no pockets. They do have a draw sting waist. I always have to have a tie around the waist so they won't fall to the ground in the middle of a game.
I may check to see if they have XXL for an exchange. But, I would never feel comfortable running or playing basketball in these. At is size they are not even comfortable for wearing at home. They are uncomfortable because they ride up into my crotch and don't leave enough room for the boys."
The material is very light but you can see glue in the gaps like it was made in a rush.
Wallet is not bad however it is not as advertised. It is all black. If I wanted an all black wallet then maybe i would add another star.
Nice pants love em but too small . I'm size large
Not at all what I expected. Thin and can't even wear them
"I bought these tights to try out as a replacement for the black Hue cotton tights, which seem to be discontinued.  These are thicker than the Hue.  I also think they seem to have a looser weave so they do not appear quite as formal.
so, if you are looking for cotton tights that are warmer than Hue, these are great in that they are a bit thicker and warmer.  also so far they are the best replacement I have found despite still appearing slightly less formal.
I am a lawyer who wears suits daily.  I have no qualms wearing these to court.  I consulted with another lawyer in my office (my personal fashion consultant) who said they are totally fine in front of a jury, so I will go with her judgment on that.
the only reason I knocked off a star is because to me they still are not as ""professional"" or ""formal"" as the Hue.  But it all depends on what you are looking for.
UPDATE: I have now worn and washed these tights three times, in a mesh bag in the washing machine on cold (the same way I wash all my tights and nylons).  They are so pilled that they are no longer appropriate to wear in public.  I will save them to wear under pants/ski pants in cold weather as an extra layer of warmth, but they will no longer be worn with skirts.
Would I buy again?  Only if I was desperate for cotton-rich black tights and I only needed to wear them once or twice.  Otherwise, skip these.
I am 5'5"" and 127.  I bought the M/L and I think next pair I will go a size down."
"I returned these shoes. They were too small (I wear an 8.5 and ordered a 9), they looked bad, like clown shoes. Very disappointed because they looked pretty good in the picture. I had planned on wearing them as casual alternatives during the summer."
"When I first received it, I thought they sent me the wring size. But I checked and it was indeed a XL. Someone wrote on one of the reviews ""don't waist your money"" I wish I would have listened. I'm a 34C and there was no way the tiny top was gonna fit my chest. I only give it one star, because it did arrive relatively early. If I could give it zero stars I would, but like I said it did arrive eat which is reserving of 1 star. I was very much looking forward to getting it in the mail, but was extremely disappointed once I did! Don't bother if u have a bigger chest, because the sizes just don't match!"
"The ring doesn't look like it has any stones in it. The ""diamonds"" look like divits of silver. The ring is true to size."
"The straps are extremely uncomfortable. Since it velcros in the front, it rubs against your skin."
"The style and color were perfect, but the smallest size was 6.  I needed a 5.5, and a sandal that's too long just doesn't look right!"
Material isn't great. My wife washed them a few times and it started to get those lint bumps. Also the vneck is low and wearing a shirt under looks weird.
"I think this watch looks good on my wrist, and it keeps good time. However, the materials feel cheap. The links in the wristband sound like jangling plastic when you take it off, not like metal. My wife thinks the whole watch looks cheap, so I thought I'd include her opinion. The price is right, but given that you can buy a much sturdier watch from Target for just a few dollars more, I can't really recommend the watch. (I received this product free or heavily discounted in exchange for an honest review.)"
"Gave wrong details, materials and wasn't what I was expecting."
"illustration indicates this falls to hips but it is really short, not quite to my waist. I am 5'10"" tall but this is much shorter than usual."
Way too small. Not one size off but two sizes too small. Their 38s are actually 32s and their 54s are actually 50s. Terrible.
Not really happy as this product is way to long. And does not gather at waist as shown. Ordered medium. Perhaps small would have been better for 5ft 120 pds
"Way to small, seriously. Size 34 is about a Size 30..."
"As cute as these are, unfortunately the toe opening, side, and material underneath the bow scrape my feet. The toe is slightly narrower than I would like, and my feet have average width."
"Rough, hard, no support."
cut them up
Doesnt make any difference with or with out! Fabric isn't tight enough!! My first Spanx and very disappointed!
"The scarf and hat are too itchy/scratchy and my daughter doesn't particularly like wearing them.  They look adorable, though!"
The company I bought from was great product sux
The ring I actually received looks nothing like this! It looks awful! Do not buy!
Wayyyy too big!!
"First time i used it the side handle button broke off. My husband is trying to fix it by putting a bolt in it. I know airports are very harsh on luggage, but this was not even checked yet at the airport, it broke when lifting onto the scale. Very disappointed."
"I do not have large hands and the one I received must be made for a toddler.  The stone sits on my knuckle and there is no way I can latch the bracelet part.  Very disappointed in the piece, will not purchase any more."
I didn't like these at all. They looked very cheap.
Bottom fit perfect top fits way too small and I do not have a big chest
Began to loss stitching right away. Maybe got 2 wears out of it.
The show itself was like the pic but length wise about a half size to big and in the strap there were no where near enough buckle holes. The room in the toes even if the length had fit was huge
"Never again. I've been a faithful buyer and supporter of Stacy Adams shoes and have purchased literally dozens of pairs over the past 15 years.  The last 2 pair I purchased, this pair at the end of March 2017, already has a hole in the bottom of the sole.  The previous pair I had (which I purchased these to replace), did the same thing but on the left foot.  Not sure what has changed in sole material but something is of lesser quality and I'm done with Stacy Adams.  Since Amazon won't allow me to return these, I'm left with posting this negative post."
Ordered it awhile ago and still haven't received.  Have ordered this in other colors.  Had problems with brown. But Black has been a favorite wear it all the time and LOVE it.  It's hit and miss with this watch.
"The dress and sleeves were different sizes.  I could not get my arms in the sleeves (size 2XL). Unfortunately I was very dissappointed, I thought the dress was pretty."
Returned. They did not seem to be polarized.
I did not like these at all. Very soon they lost their shape and the rear of this shoe started slipping off my heel. I use these to wear inside my Uggs but given their price per pair I find it hard to recommend it to anyone
smaller than expected and see thru
My daughter is petite and slim. The fitted part of the petticoat was way too big it hung on her hips but if she wriggled it would fall off.  Had to return.
"Positives first: It is very unique and my daughter likes it because no one else has one.

Negative: It took six weeks to get here but we knew that it was going to be slow when we ordered it so that didn't really play into the review.
The owl is printed on rubber and it smells of rubber as well. This is not leather.
The back panel is cheap leather but I feel it was misrepresented and too expensive .
It is small and even if her lunchbox would fit inside, the small zipper (between the horns) won't allow a standard size lunchbox.
It is large enough for one folder and some papers and that's it.

That being said, my middle schooler loves owls so much that she is willing to carry this pack, her lunchbox and her flute separately. She still uses it but I feel a bit conned."
"I bought these in the pewter metallic color. The shoe looks very cute but there is absolutely no support, padding, or cushion when you walk. I would recommend that you buy your true size and add some cushy air pillow insoles. I can barely use these shoes."
Fell apart in a matter of months.
not exactly locs. should remove this from the title and description. misconceiving. they curve and wrap around too much. locs are a lot flatter. also wider. i bought another pair from the same seller. that are actual locs. but non polarized. they are much better. and fit better. these are okay as regular glasses for bros. but not for locs.
"Cheap. Breaks easily. I tried cleaning them. After i took them out of the cleaner, they all started to break and chip. Poor ! Definitely a waste of my money."
Very cute but not not the best quality material. Plus they run about a size and a half to small. Definitely order a size up. I'll be returning this and trying a bigger size. I'm keeping my fingers crossed.
"I returned this product.  Purchased as a gift for my wife, but decided not to even present it to her (I then bought this one and feel it looks much better&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1-50-Cts-8-mm-Round-Lab-Created-Emerald-Solitaire-Pendant-in-14K-White-Gold/dp/B0051S23RE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1.50 Cts 8 mm Round Lab Created Emerald Solitaire Pendant in 14K White Gold</a>).  The emerald itself shined, but it really does not look like a heart and the one I received was crooked."
This suit runs way small. I sent it back and the customer service was great they did all they could but the larger one they sent was also way small for the size it should have been. It is a very cute suit but dose not fit the way the ad says it should.
"I have worn a dozen or more pairs of Asics. Every pair was a size 8. I ordered an 8 in this shoe, and it looked and fit like a 7 or smaller. I held it up with another pair of Asics, and it was no where close to an 8. I ordered another pair of Asics in a different style from Amazon at the exact same time, and it fits like every other pair I've owned. I loved the color in this Noosa Tri 10 but not the fit."
"Cheap material, short length, not happy with this purchase"
This runs sname....not as expected
"OK, after having tried these for awhile, I have given them to my roommates son, who wears adult small, and they fit him perfect... he's 14 ~100LBS. I have had the same exact issue with this brands boxer shorts, so this brand is much too small."
"I received the item very fast and returned it fast. While the item was not pricey this is the second purchase.  Stones fall out too easy. Received on a Saturday,  placed on bracelet,  by Sunday 4 stones were gone. Disappointed because its so pretty"
"I bought these shoes in July. Six months later and the stitching is coming out. Very disappointed in the quality. I don't wear them much, maybe once a month."
nwas not as pictured returned...
"It cuts into the sides of my foot, and it will not stay on."
"I give this 2 stars because of personal preference. I like the mid-rise pants and these are more of the ""mom-pants"", going all the way to my waist. Unfortunately the description doesn't mention this. I bought the 18W Long and the length was good but the pants themselves were a bit big, I think mostly because of the stretchy material. I think they would have got bigger throughout the day as a lot of pants do. I would suggest buying a size smaller, and only if you like the very high waist."
"Small-ish -- especially after wash. I think these are geared towards 10-14 years old, even so they're still going to be small for them"
"Ordered this product from Ark Toys, but it is the same exact description. The description states that it is the Melissa and Doug Medical Dress up set, combined with a toy tool kit with 19 pieces. I knew that the tool kit was not made by Melissa and Doug, but I did think that it would compliment the set.

First off, the toys in the medical kit were nice, and quality toys, but it was a SIX piece set, not 19 as advertised. Even if you count the kit and every single piece of the costume set, I still only got to 15. Also, the actual case was on the cheap side, and was difficult to open and close for an adult, never mind a child.

I returned this and ordered just the Melissa and Doug costume. Would not recommend the bundle. I will find a sturdy and cool doctor's kit for my son."
These shoes have a weird fit. They are both somewhat small and somewhat large in various places. During distance running or walking they become extremely uncomfortable. I would not recommend these shoes.
It was way to small and the string to the hood were missing.
"It has broke in less than few months just stop working, very sad and I cant find a repair shop nor the warranty"
I purchase Sketcher sneakers all the time and they usually run a little small.  This shoe runs large and wide. Cant keep yhem on my feet when I walk.
"Dress doesnt look like the picture.  It is Neon BRIGHT orange amd does not flow as shown.  Also, when I asked to return it, they asked that I give it as a gift and receive a 20% refund.  I will NOT purchase from this company again."
"Ugh. Disappointing. They were too small (wear a 7.5, ordered a 7.5), too heavy, & too uncomfortable. Don't bother. I ended up buying a pair of composite toed shoes instead which I'm much more pleased with. These just sit in my closet gathering dust which is unfortunate because I think they're pretty attractive boots."
"OK, so I've worn Reef brand flip flops just about every day since 2003 and have sworn by them.  These flip flop are useless though.  They straps are very thin and flimsy making it extremely annoying to get on your foot.  Basically you need to coax them on w/ your fingers unlike my other Reefs that can just be slipped on as you walk out the door.  Also, they are VERY narrow and shorter than usual.  I tried them on outside and walked around so I can't return them.  DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE!"
"Fabric stiff for pj's. Medium too tight for 5'4, 145 lbs - size 38 C bra"
"Terrible, fabric  has less strength than control top stockings. I pulled them on and my thumb went right through the fabric. Total waste of money."
very tight fit. It was not comfortable. I could hardly breathe.
This zipper broke the first week of use. Poorly made.
"It's advertised as a heavyweight henley but a Riggs henley is more heavyweight, more comfort fitting and has less shrinkage than Dickies. The only problem with Riggs is I wish they had more colors. I am a medium size and Riggs fits a little more comfortable when working or execising."
didn't last as long as expected for the price paid.  After only about a month the shoes looked as if they had been purchased at a garage sale. Will not be purchasing these again.
"Decent but not great. Bought these for my 3 year old, who is large for his size. The seams began to rip after one wash."
"They're cute, but not worth the price. I barely tried 1 on and they already broke."
"I needed grey boots and finally thought I found the perfect pair. I usually love Miz Mooz products but not this time. These boots do not stay up by the knees- the leather slouches down and needs to be yanked up every few minutes when I am walking. Also, as others have written in their reviews (wish I would have read them before purchasing) the boots make a weird, annoying squeaking sound when you walk in them. Drives me crazy. Don't try to sneak in late to a meeting in these boots! Embarrassing!"
"Very poor quality. The braided leather is much too loosely braided. One of the strands is actually cotton string, not leather.  the leather (and cotton) appears to be painted red rather than dyed, so the cut raw ends appear white. The watch appears to be holding time well. I received this 2 weeks after the latest estimated delivery date. To be fair, the customer service I received when I sent an email enquiry about the non delivery was very polite, a rapid reply, and they offered to refund the cost (although that won't now be necessary because it did eventually arrive). I'm thinking of pulling it all apart and using the beads and watch to make my own version."
"much too large compared to the comparison brand I also bought thru amazon.  both sleeves & body were way too big.  Hope it was just mislabeled in size.
I returned."
"I can almost GAURANTEE you that these are not wool socks! They don't feel like wool, they don't smell like wool, and they don't wear like wool! They are more like polyester and cotton blend at the BEST. They fall apart a little more each time I wear them! I have black fuzzies all over my floors constantly when I wear these. I have only worn them about four times and already they are thread bare! If I could give a zero star rating I would. The photo I added shows the bottom of my foot after taking off the sock. I also bought their navy blue ones and they are the same way. I am now throwing all of them away!"
"This ran much smaller than advertised.  I planned on using this post part and ended up having a c-section birth.  Due to the fit of this garment, I was unable to use it at all.  One of the pieces rubbed my incision which made it highly uncomfortable.  Additionally, this waist trimmer is very bulky under clothing and you can definitely see where the velcro sections are.  Hope this helps for any postpartum mom considering making the purchase!"
"very cute, but really uncomfortable. might just be the most uncomformtable sneakers i've ever owned. so, don't be fooled by its look."
"the bag itself was sooo beautiful in fact i love it so much. I carried this bag for one day and the handle nails started falling out didn't carry it again. as hard as i tried to screw them back in, the bag could not even stay intact. i hated it that i had to buy it just to waste my money. it was so painful because i loved my bag so much"
"Extremely cheap and thin material. Save your money and go with something else. First of all, it smelled horrible, I gagged taking it out of the box. Also, the zipper ripped as I was taking it on and off, and it wasn't because it was too small or I was too rough, its just horribly cheap. It also feels stiff and gross (though might be improved by washing). Im just going to throw it away"
very weird fit.  Huge waist and tight in the thighs.  This needed to be returned
These are ridiculous. I'll be returning them
Soles started to fall apart after a few months. Pretty disappointed as I've liked New Balance in the past
"These are gorgeous, so this breaks my heart... I MUST return them! The sizing is so ridiculous on these! The left fits perfectly... exactly like a perfect size 5, and with the right foot shoe... I cant even fit my toes in! I am a perfect size 5 and every pair of Jessica Simpson heels has fit me PERFECTLY until these!  It's as if they made a mistake a put a size 4 or 4.5 in the box by mistake. I'm very sad to send these back."
The side seams rub
Was not what expected.  Little to no support
Shrunk like crazy.
"Sorry to say these are going back. I recently purcased a pair of Ryka Lily and LOVE them. These fit about the same but there is NO arch support.  If I were to keep these I'd have to add inserts so whats the point? I would say these are slightly more comfy than sketcher go walks so they will work for some, not me. I wish Ryka was more reliable and consistent in the make and support of their shoes."
"It's a nice watch: easy to adjust, light-weight, nice design. But to me it just looks like cheap, fake gold. Also, it's very dainty and I'm ready for something a little bigger."
"When I wear these, the fabric for the heel is about an inch above my actual heel, and it makes an unattractive bulge right above my shoe. They really shouldn't advertise these for ""all"" shoe sizes"
It's cute but it never came in the mail!!!!
Unable to wear these shoes. They are way too big. Wish I had returned them but forgot about them in the closet.
Previous years have been great.  This year is NOT water proof.
Wig itself is beautiful but the cap is small and kept sliding.  It did work for Mardi Gras.  I would not recommend this to a friend.
The band across the top of the foot was too big.
Horrible the zipper started to break a week in. And don't even bother trying to get another they refuse. I will never deal with this again .
"I sent this cap back.  I know it said oversized, but it is huge.  It should be considered to be a 3xl or bigger.  I might have been able to put up with the hat being too big if it wasn't for the extended length of the bill.  It was so long that it would fall down over my eyes so that I couldn't see."
"Not worth 25c, the stones are painted plaster, they arrived broken, sent a replacement pair,but still look pretty cheap. Heavy metal, heavy ""stones""."
"Everything about the shirt is great, except for it's durability. After two gentle-cycle washes, the shirt now no longer has a hem at the bottom, and the large black areas in the design (Jake's eyes and nose) already have yellow blasting through. Disappointing."
Well I never got the product and I had to buy something else for my son to wear for Halloween!!!! So I have no idea how it would fit!!!!
"Once again Amazon has listed a product and a Retailer that is supposed to sell it.
Once again the Retailer didn't ship the item listed.
This wouldn't be so bad, but Iv'e purchased the Cap listed before and like the way it fits and looks.
So it's disappointing to receive something that is not cut the same, the fabric is not the enzyme wash listed

Enzyme Regular Solid Army Caps-Black W35S45D
Different brand, Different Style.
Not this Cap.
PDS Online"
"I was surprised by the reviews. The gown was supposed to be cotton and it says so on the label. However, it most certainly is not 100% coot on. It feels like a polyester blend and looks very cheap like it came from a bargain truck in China. I will wash it and see how comfortable it is. But, I'm temped to send it back."
"They didn't come in a nike box. Just a brown box, no tissue. Fit small and flat."
order one size definitely
"I bought these for my son who has a size 9 foot. He could not even get his foot into it. Rather than return it I tried wearing them, and they fit except too long for my woman's size 9. Also there was a plastic rivet  loose in the lining that I actually had to cut the lining to remove. Not happy at all."
"One shoe fit all right, and the other seemed like the toe was too flat. I love Alegria shoes, when I finally find a pair that fits normally."
"Fits entirely too small. The cup size is does not fit me as a ""busty"" person at all. The material is comfortable, but the bra chart is way off on sizing. I am a 36DDD/F and neither the Medium busty nor the Large busty fit. Will return and go to my local maternity store. I tried customer service in facebook and they weren't of any help."
"This is more like a high rise pant that sits right in your waist, if you have a little shorter torso. I felt stumpy and overweight in these...and Im really not. Couldnt get them off fast enough."
Numbers to dark to see.
"You get what you pay for. Material is cheap and it has a smell. I am usually a size S, but this dress what very tight.  I wouldn't recommend this dress."
"had these these shoes about a year, used very little. The other day the part that holds your toes in broke at the base. The quality of these shoes or not worth the money .......... I really thought for the price they would last a while....... nope, very cheap.  I would stand clear of these expensive shoes ......just sayin."
Too loose. Not really one size fits all.
Plating wore off after two days. Very unattractive and cheap looking after that. Not very pleased with quality.
Horrible quality! My daughter used this backpack for two days and the handle already ripped off and the strap is coming off! It's a waist of money! Do not buy this backpack! My daughter is five and had a folder in it that's all!
Too thin; see through.... too small....  very disappointed.
This is an adorable outfit but unfortunately it ran very small. It was a gift for a friend so I felt bad when she couldn't put it on her son for Easter as she had hoped :(
Sent this coat back. Was to large.
"ordered wide, very narrow and I usually don't have a problem, It's as if you do not have smaller feet, you cannot find shoes, not my fault I was born with these feet"
They're run big
"These shoes are really cute, the purple is nice.  They arrived well packaged, quickly, but they are tiny.  They run short, narrow, and my feet are just feet.  Have to return them and go along with I don't have Merrell feet."
Did not receive instructions with the product. Trying to figure it out.  Disappointed!!!!
"Well, this bra didn't cost much, so I guess I should have expected it to be cheap.  It stretches out of shape quickly and then becomes uncomfortable."
These were great the first time I wore them but they fell apart in the wash.  Bummer.
"The foot section was way to long.  However, the riser went up the leg nicely and held postion."
It's kinda small.
"When the shirt first arrived, I tried it on and it looked GREAT!  BUT when it came to ironing, no matter how much I tried to save it, it had white blotch where ever I passed the iron. My shirt was ruined !!!! :("
Too small. So I returned it.
"Cute shoe, good fit, but the footbed of one sandal started peeling before I ever got a chance to wear them outside of the house. Hopefully this was a one-off issue, since the other shoe appeared to be fine. Makes me question the quality of materials."
"I was hoping to be able to slip these on and off (barefoot), but a seam at the back rubbed skin off on my hamstring, resulting in a painful wound. So be advised, sock are required!"
I have bought dickies shirts before.  I ordered a 2x as usual.. . definately wasn't also the fabric felt kind of thin and plasticky.
too large enough for 5 people
"Its cute but sorta ""cheap"". I got it for about half the price; i wouldnt pay the full price for it. Not sure how its gonna hold up in any sort of wind, but its really cool looking and a decent size. Seems just a tad small for my preference, but I trek campus all day and need a wide umbrella to keep my bookbag dry.

upddate is that this umbrella didn't last one season. handle is flimsy and broke."
"Good item , good size but I believe the interior rubs off on the shoes inside as i have found black marks on my brand new nike's which are white. I recommend this item only for black shoes."
"Ordered watch to replace my current 1440 sports watch because the band broke (and it's cheaper to buy a new watch than to buy the band and replace it).  Received new watch and thought it was just like current watch, however, the T2 mode only stays in that mode for 1 minute then it reverts back to the T1 mode all by itself.  Called Timex to see if the watch was defective because I couldn't believe it would be practical to have a second time zone that reverts back to the original time zone after one minute.  Timex rep confirmed it must be defective so I ordered a replacement watch.  Received second watch and it's the same as the first one.  Only stays in the T2 mode for 1 minute.  Sent both watches back and am currently working with Timex to figure out why they would design a watch that way (not to mention you can't silence the beep when changing modes).  I like the watch otherwise, but am giving it one star to highlight this problem if you are a traveler and need two time zones."
Arm holes way too small
"No way worth the money... nice product, but not enough pockets for organization.  Try a Briggs and Riley."
Boots run a little big. Only problem is I ordered black boots and received brown boots. Needed them for a ski weekend so had to make do with brown.
"I didn't even get the chance to wear this skirt.  I was in desperate need of a black skirt for work.  The fit was very good, but the zipper broke immediately."
"Very pretty, but does not fit around my chest. The front panels are about 6"" wide on either side of the seams. I can put it on, sleeves are long enough,shoulders fine, but it doesn't even come close to fitting around the front. It's the weirdest sweater I've ever put on. Maybe I can find a woman with no breasts, who it will fit. I suppose that's what the ""funky"" is all about. Haven't had time to send it back, for the price, I'll just donate it."
returend them --- way too big
"Will not buy again, botton too small to set up time. It describes batteries includes on the package but it didn't."
"I am LE. This product was extremely uncomfortable. I wore it for about two months. I tried various positions and tension. It left significant bruises on my hips and was painful to wear during shift. Initially, I thought I would get used to the discomfort but the pain never subsided. I had to go back to shirt stays."
I order 4 extra-large  and I got 3  extra large  these t shirt runs very small
Shirt is garbage --fits poorly--low quality--not worth the money-worth about 10.00--better quality shirts out there for less than this-don't waste your money
Purchase for my 15 year old son and ended up returning the suit because it revealed more than I considered acceptable in the nether regions. I tried putting on clothing items under the suit and it either looked bad or didn't help. An adult might not mind as much.
The boots are cute. The buckles on the side are flimsy and will break. Literally broke the first time I tried them on. The customer service is very poor with this company and I haven't been able to process a return with them. Wouldn't purchase again.
The fur falls out
"Too big, had to go back."
Looked nothing like it did in the pictures. Will be returning.
Not at all like old silvers .
"The color is true to view, vibrant and beautiful, and the lace details are very cute. Unfortunately this dress is just too large and I had to return it. I'm 5'4"", 125, usually a size 6 fits perfectly, but this dress was too loose up top, the fabric kind of sags down so there's no shape to your body, and about a good 4 inches dragging on the floor. Even with a size 4 would still be too long for me. You'd probably need to be a size 4 over 5'7 to look good in it."
it smells like a dog poo. maybe coming from the suede? i fabreezed it 1 full month each time i use it and it still smells sooooo awfulll....this runs little bigger so i would recommend ggetting a 2 size smaller
fabric and style is not what i expected.
The dress I received looked nothing like the dress advertised; you can clearly see that in the bodice detail of the attached comparison photo. So disappointed. I immediately requested to return it (it took some time since the company is in China).
"These shoes are not the same as picture, actually the quality is very poor. Moreover, they run small. I have purchase two other pairs of Enzo Angiolini shoes. They are a perfect fit and quite beautiful!"
"I think they are very pretty, but they fit way to small, defintely consider getting a size up. These are for out and about, but not for long distances, for looks not for quality."
"I tried it on in a store before buying it online.  Fit reasonably well in store but not so good from my online purchase.  Feel like I am stuck with it.  Shoes are another thing I have added to my list of things not to purchase online  because of the issues related to returns and warranty.  The top of my list is electronics.  The DVD/radio player I purchased for my truck is another one.  If you have trouble its a real pain to get it fixed whereas a local store will usually stand behind their product including taking it out and putting it back in again.  But I digress.
Anyway, back to the boots.  I find they are very uncomfortable around my ankles.  It rubs against my ankles and is uncomfortable to wear so I don't lace all the way up.  I leave the top two latches undone and makes it easier to walk in them but gives no ankle support which was the point of this style boot.  Also and to a lesser degree a problem is that my orthotics don't fit well inside.  Don't know why but they just don't.  So wouldn't recommend them."
"Way, Way, Way too small. Very disappointed in this product"
new blank cuff beanie visor is okay but I didn't like the way it fit on the top of my head
Horrible and thin. Dont waste your money
Ordered mens and got a womens
I was really excited to get this in but after wearing it I don't like it at all. It does not really hold anything in like a spanx should. All it does is roll up while I wear it and I get so aggravated that I take it off. If I was able to return it I would. Not impressed.
lens fall off alot
The material as flimsy and would be easily stained.
lace is too low. Came in Coral not pink :( Sending it back
After 3 weeks the bra loosened out and began to stretch. The straps didn't fit very well and could not stay up. I found it's worth to wait for a more quality bra to go on sale then buy these.
"Great looking stones but horrible band, ordered as a gift for girl and really felt bad about how awful the band started stripping within days...spend more and get a nicer quality band"
"Okay, this is kind of hard to explain. I really liked the skirt, but I do not know if it is my body type or just how to skirt was constructed. Initially, I ordered a size medium, which was huge, so I returned it and ordered a small. I should also mention that I am usually a small to medium in skirts so I was sure that the small would be fine. When I tried on the small, the waist was still pretty large but I thought that I could work with it. Then, I tried it on with a shirt tucked in, and it just looked so strange. The waist was too large, but then the section that falls on the hips is tighter than the waist. This is clearly not a free hip skirt and doesn't really give you the ""circle skirt"" effect that vintage style skirts usually do. This might be a body type issue, but I don't know."
"The fabric of this shirt seemed nice enough, but the shirt is incredibly HUGE! I bought the XLT, same size as I order in other brands, and this one fit me like a dress.  I'm 6'4"" and about 245, wear at 48L jacket.  This shirt went down to my mid-thighs, and the shoulder seams were a good 4"" down from my shoulder.  Since it's a shirt meant for working out, I just don't think it needs to be this huge.  I don't have the physique for wearing tight fitting stuff, but normal t-shirts just need a couple extra inches on the length and an inch or so on the sleeve.  I was very hopeful when I ordered this t-shirt but wound up pretty disappointed."
"These are beautiful socks, but they are way too tight at the top.  They dig into me."
"They fit too small, the are a cheap imitation of the converses."
I was expecting much more for the price. The leather left a gray coating on my hands and the faux silk in side the pockets was just a cheap material. Definitely not work the price paid. Looks good in the picture but very disappointing in person and would not recommend.
"I returned this.  Way too large!  Not flattering for a 5'0"" frame."
"I got it thinking it was going to fit me because i am 5' 4"" and 125 lbs and i dnt have a huge booty, they are weigh too small!.. They are about size 4 US, which is for children."
"This shirt is not acceptable for those with large boobs. The ""cups"" are a c max and don't lay well. It looks terrible."
"Super adorable print, but top is plain black tank top fits ok, pants are awkwardly made. No label. Cheap fabric. Almost like it was knock off. No stretch so my daughter can't even bend her legs without it ripping. Head band also had the cute print but was very flimsy. Can't tell it's a bow attached."
Did not fit and the lace had a ton of holes and runs in it
Zipper is ultra uncomfortable and very noticeable under clothing. Nice compression but not practical.
The zipper broke off
The picture used is of a more expensive version of this suit. It looks in the picture as if this swimsuit is made from a banded (bodycon) style material. It is a thin swimsuit material with little to no structure. It does not look or fit like the picture. Sad.
"horribly large, color is wired the material is not good either"
"I purchased two of these, one was perfect and I love it. But the other one had a broken zipper. Haven't spoken with the seller yet, but poor quality on the zipper."
Wanted to love this hat but the brim is bent weird and it is sewn on uneven.  This hat makes me look like a moron  Going back
"This bathing suit is TERRIBLE!  I'm shocked at all the good reviews.  First of all, it runs like 2 sizes small.  I am 5'5"" 140 lbs, usually a size 6, and ordered a 10 based on reviews.  It is snug.  Not only that, the cups inside are too small for my boobs (36D).  The bathing suit pushed my boobs down, making it look very unflattering.  It def doesn't fit or look anything like the model in the picture.  Sending it back!"
these were too small. I gave them away. they weren't true to size.
Feels like half size too small and can't use them because the opening at the toe cuts into my skin.
fell apart after only one wear.
I ordered the animal print swim dress but instead I was sent a one piece animal print bathing suit and a purple swim dress. I had read previous reviews of this happening but I decided to order anyway because it said it was in stock. WRONG! They think it's okay to say they have it in stock and then send you two of something different to make up for it and it's not. Very disappointed and will not order from this seller again.
This product seemed to be cheaply made and was sticking to itself when I opened the package. I ordered a 2t but it looked big enough to fit my 7 year old. Unfortunately it had to be returned.
cheap and itchy
"Super cheap. Bought it as a gift, disappointed since I have bought stuff from Konov in the past & have been pleased."
"Those are not sketchy
Very stiff fit and way too small
Terrible material
Nice colors
Unfortunately disappointed
Asked for refund"
Looks good on the page but very poorly made and quality of fabric is very rough . Top yoke is made of knit but the skirt is cotton . No shape to the garment and looks very cheap .
Ugly!!
"just not comfortable, cotton is rough, they don't stay up.  other brands are way better."
"too heavy for my ear, makes it bleed. and i believe i'm allergic to it, Not for sensitive ears!! however, looks really amazing!! just bigger and heavier than i thought! and my ears get a rash!"
The legs are insanely small on this item. I had to cut the finished edge to get them to fit. Sizing is way off.
"I tried this in the store and the bristles scratched my Red Wings in one swipe and just spread the mud along the sides of my boots. Would recommend for anything not leather, which practically defeats it's use for work boots."
"Ride too much on the rear area especially if you are a plus size woman, no support, just a pretty pantie."
"UPDATE: I'm dropping three stars from my original 5 star review - the reason is on the photos. After only 6-7 months of wearing these shoes (and wearing them a lot I have to admit), the inside looks extremely worn out. Don't know what materials Clark's used for the inside, but it's no good at all. Don't think I'm gonna buy Clark's anymore, seriously just look at what they've become.

------------------------

So, I was big fan of ECCO shoes. Well I'm still is, but it gets harder to cough up $200+ for a pair. Then I bought Clarks for the first time few years ago, and now I have 3 pairs of Clarks. They are well built, last long, comfortable, and cost half that of ECCO's.

These particular shoes look good for a smart-casual attire in the office, and suit jeans just as well. They are comfortable, good cushioning for a long day on feet. Color is nice. They seem to run a bit larger - there is some room in the toe area, not an issue though (would've been worse if they ran small). I'm very pleased"
I have a pair of these but they are not the same shoe I already have.  These don't have much of a lip on the back of them & they seem like there is less shoe there.  I didn't care for them.
"too small, had to send it back and order a mens size of a similar jacket, which was a good fit"
"Might just be me but I was trying to find full leather shoes because of job hazards and these were excruciating to walk in. I tried for some time, however, to see if they would break in and by the end I just threw them away because after only a couple of weeks they looked abhorrent. And in a worn down kind of way. I usually keep my saucony's for a year or more before replacing them but these just couldn't handle it."
I normally wear a 9-9.5 shoe. I know this brand runs a little smaller so I ordered the EU 42 which is an 8-8.5. They were too large so I exchanged them for a 41 (7-7.5). They arrived today and are STILL too large. I really like the quality of this brand so I will try again with a 40 (6-6.5). I wish ECCO could get their sizing right. One star for the hassle. 5 STARS for Quality & durability.
If u decide to purchase this bra order 1 size bigger. .... The cup was way too small for me I was spilling out on  the sides an I usually where DD
"Cute top, but was too tight in the arms and too big in the bust area. (38c)"
Runs extremely large and I didn't  receive any packing slip so I cannot return.
2 stars because i love the material . Very comfortable and you can move freely not worrying that it might rip or something. The problem is this way too big for me. I'm 4'11 . I usually order Jr. size scrubs. I wanted to give this a try because of the review. but this is way too big. i usually wear xs . but this one fits like Larger to me.
Ended up returning; according to size chart they should have fit but didnt
I usually wear a small bottom and a medium top. I ordered this in a large after reading that it runs small. The bikini I received would not fit an adult over 90 lbs. looks like it is for a small child. Waste of money! At least it was only $12. Barely worth paying to ship it back...
I ordered these for work.  Build quality is good but they didn't fit.  Way too small.  I passed them around to several different people to see if they wanted them and they fit nobody.  Strangely proportioned.  Not worth sending back.  I'll have to take the loss.
It is very pretty but runs small
I should have read the description better. I saw a review that said it would cover your whole back! Well yess it would if you were 10 years old! It must be a child's backpack. I couldn't even put it on much less think of it covering my entire back. Good thing it was so cheap. I gave it to my friends 6 year old....I gotta learn to read.
Look good in the Picture but it have bad quality
Returned this...it's more of a sweatshirt than a jacket. The fabric is not very heavy.
They HURT my feet!!!...VERY uncomfortable...I want to send it back!!!...they are soooooo hard
Itchy!  And it was advertised as 100% cotton.  It was instead acrylic.  Gave it away.  Disappointing.  PLEASE BE MORE CAREFUL WITH SEARCH OF PRODUCTS!!
"this is a cute top, however, it's poorly made. The neck part was poorly sewn, the entire blouse was poorly sewn, there were loose threads. At least it's cute
I would not buy this again"
AWFUL IS TOO BAGGY ITS CHEAOLY MADR NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE
Too Small!!! Returned no problems.
It shrinks to end up being wider and shorter.
"Looks cool...too bad it took so long to get here (it was a Christmas gift) and arrived broken. It fell apart almost completely the first time my granddaughter wore it. If I could give it a ZERO, I would."
"When we received these shirts, my husband tried one on and it fit well.  After we washed them in cold water, even though they were preshrunk, they did not fit well anymore.  Also, and this is almost unbelievable, after my husband wore the shirt for one and a half hour, the collar began to curl.  These were advertised as stay flat collars. I am sending these back. They are poor quality."
Cud have been a little tighter and the material was a bit cheap
I thought this was going to be so cute. It wasn't it was so huge it engulfed my ear and sat weird.
Clothes bought directly from China are extremely too small and extra-large in China would be a medium in United States sizes. I believe that most clothing from China have to be relabeled once they get into the United States by these United States companies It should say in the clothing ads that the clothes are coming directly from China.
"This money clip is nice looking however it doesn't hold much. My husband likes to hold money and credit cards. If you only have a couple cards and little cash, this might be okay but if you carry several cards and a lot of cash, this isn't the money clip for you."
The crystal looks cheap.  The tongs holding it gets snaggs all clothes!  It looks like the amount I paid for it.  This was pretty bad.
Yoo cheap material don't buy it
Kind of flimsy.  I wish it was made of thicker material.
I love these boots - I got them yesterday and was excited to wear them tonight - wore them for about 2 hrs - mostly sitting - to see that the stitching came out of the elastic already!
The item received with zipper not functional. Had to take it for alterations.
"I wore these only in the house, and the sole cracked in half after two months.  Not worth the money."
Very itchy very uncomfortable would never purchase one like it again!
Ordered a XL and received leggings that are very small. Almost child size. My 10 yr old daughter might be able to fit them but that's still a gamble.
gets cloudy way too fast.
They were really cute when I took them out of the box. I wear a 8.5 and I ordered an 8.5 n they fit great. The problems I had was when I put them on they were tighter around my calf then I i like and they were really pointy. Kind of reminded me of witch shoes. So I sent them back got my refund right away.
"I am unhappy Cinderella!... I did not order these boats! I order 8.5 and W8 9.5 come in mail. Cute shoes They are a lot like my old worn out Keens that need glue and duck tape..... I hope they can create a shoe app that could correspond with what we try to order...oh butt to error is human! Try again I need to replace my Keen Newport H2s purchased in 2005 and my Slippers ""those sleeping bags for your feet"" wore out the BACKs! Just turned them baby's into slides. And my leather slip-ons I guess there not in production any more, which these boats were my replacements. I guess I'm joining the ""Got the wrong size club""  hey smack you on YOUR Amazon! Whoopaa...Try again and get my 8.5 size I be ordering a boat load of shoes. NOT big boats. Two STARS because... You can only make ONE! First impression. Pshhhh"
Low price and low quality.
These are not a good purchase because the screw backs are so small they are impossible to screw on.  I tried to screw  the backs on for proably 20 minutes before giving up.  Very disappointed because I purposely bought these for every day wear.
"I'm usually a 10.5.  These boots were half a size too small for me.  Otherwise, they seemed ok."
Fabric is awful!!!!! Donated them after missing the return cut off. These were NOTHING like my old Lee jeans. I was so disappointed. Won't buy them again.
"This bag is cute, but it doesn't hold up long.  I've had mine for a few months and the inside zip didn't work which happened almost immediately. Now the snaps are tearing off of the fabric they are attached to."
Poorly made. Purchased these 4 months ago and they snapped in half during a simple cleaning. They did some filmsy when I first purchased them but seeing how easily they broke in two and barely lasted 5 months I won't be repurchasing again. Heard such good things about Maui Jim definitely not impressed with my first purchase with them.
"The straps are very uncomfortable. They are set too wide in the back and cross in a weird way over your shoulder blades. It also offers little support. Might be ok for yoga or something very low impact but no good for circuit training. The pads in it are odd looking and you can see the edges of them. That said, it was not expensive and came quickly."
"I had a very good experience with another hat made by Bailey of Hollywood. Unfortunately, this hat did not live up to the same expectations. This fedora is cheaply made from a soft flannel that makes it nearly impossible to shape the hat as you prefer. Once you have shaped the hat, the slightest touch will change the look - and not for the better. My experience with the Stetson fedora (I know - who thought Stetson made anything other than cowboy hats?) was far better. So skip this large piece of loose felt and spend your money on the Stetson. You will be glad that you did!"
"They were comfortable, though slightly larger than expected.  However, the heel in one of the boots broke after I wore them for less than two weeks.  I attempted to continue using them, but walking was uncomfortable with the broken heel and the second heel broke a few uses later.  Do not recommend purchasing these."
"I like the fit and look, but unfortunately my first order was defective.  The strap on the right shoe was at least one inch shorter than the left one.  The left one felt fine, but the right one did not.  I returned them and have ordered another pair in hopes that the new pair will not be defective.  Would have given it four stars if the straps had been the same size.  There just doesn't seem  to be any quality control anymore and this is usually a good brand."
I DON'T LIKE THAT THE SWEATPANTS ARE TOO SMALL BUT OVERALL CUTE..
it was too small but I ordered another one
"What happened to these? I've been wearing them for years. Well, not anymore. The fabric they now use is very rough and they are way tighter and more uncomfortable than before. And , yes, I weigh the same and they are same size as before. They obviously changed manufacturers or something. Anyway...I since ordered some very similar Fruit of the Loom's and they are great. They are just like these USED to be."
Not good quality.  pilled and shrunk.
"If you have narrow feet, these are the slides for you! I love the color, but these are not made for people who have shape or width in their feet. I am not one of those people, so they went back."
broke fast
sizing was not he same
Cheap junk!
I didn't realize I was buying an XL.
"I bought this chain for my partner months ago. it has now turned black. He keeps wearing it , so I went into his jewelry box and added a new 24k plated bracelet and matching chain. I'm trying to get him to put this old one away, don't rough  it away, just put it aweay He looks sharp in his new bling"
"This is a black & white striped dress made of bathing suit material. My computer monitor gave me the impression that this dress was navy blue and white. Also, it isn't well made. there was a partial white stripe where the top black stripe meets the black chest material. The defect was super obvious so I returned it. Otherwise I would have kept it as a beach dress to wear over a bathing suit. I also noticed the elbow patches weren't exactly on the elbows. Bummer : (

Final note... I am always a medium and based on other reviews I ordered a large which fit me perfectly."
cheap looking. You get what you pay for.
"These are really nice shoes, but if you have wide feet, especially where the joint of your toes meeting the feet are, these will not work."
Doesn't match the inches it says and the elastic cuts into your sides when you sit I would say go with a drawstring style.
Needs to say 34 length in the product description.  Way too long of pant legs for me.  No stretch either.
"I love toe rings. At first i was so excited by these however I have lost 6 so far. One or two stretching out could be acceptable based on the pricing,  At first the fit is perfect but after a day of wear they have fallen off. The couple I found have allstretched out."
The description on the website says 100% cotton. I thought it was too good to be true: it's 35% cotton; the rest is polyester and it all feels like polyester. I don't wear polyester. Straighten out your description! I will never buy anything of this brand again.
"I purchased these training pants for overnight wear. We cloth diapered, and didn't want to cave and buy pull ups now. I thought my nights of changing sheets in a sleep-deprived stupor were over. I read they were leak proof. They certainly are not. And my nights of changing sheets and cleaning up a cranky toddler continued until I finally caved and bought the darn pull ups."
too short and narrow for American larger feet.
I don't wear it as its super scratchy and bothers my neck. it is rather flimsy also. I should have returned it...
One chain is longer and hard to put on and one is loser no matter how tight i make it
They seemed really good quality but the sole separated from the shoe on the 3rd wearing so I had to return them.
Both broke (the plastic cracked) after one overseas trip!
Not as shown . Looks cheap and much larger than thought
Does this work with the note 4?
Didn't last a year even though I put them on delicate cycle
junk!!! belt broke immediately
Tried wearing these for a few days to see if they would break in - they do not. Glad Amazon has a great return policy. The steel toes pinch your toes together - maybe it's because my feet are too wide?
"Have to agree with many of reviewers that durability is an issue. First day used for less than an hour and already had a tear in the toe of left sock (apparently somewhat common). Also heel will slip off in various situations so maybe the silicone pad needs reworking too? or the cut of the heel cup?

For ref: bought large size, have US 12-D feet

I highly suggest the manufacturer substitute the cotton for nylon or a similarly tough synthetic and make a third size from 11 and up."
"The jumpsuit wears 4size smal, I had to sell to someone very skinny."
"Buyers be warned.  This product is not as pictured. First of all it is a clear Chinese knockoff.  The Frozen ""Tag"" looks like it was printed on someone's inkjet computer.  I also had issues with the bodice being an turquoise blue (more green to it), but the skirt being more of a true blue.  The shades of blue did not match at all.  But I bought this for Christmas last winter and I was nervous about finding another Elsa dress, so I kept it.  This was all my daughter wanted from Santa.

On Christmas morning my daughter was so excited and immediately put this dress on.  Later in the day she had a strange rash.  I hoped it was just a coincidence.

I washed the dress, then tried it on her again a few days later.  Again, my daughter broke out in a rash.

I learned that Chinese clothing manufacturers have zero regulation regarding the chemicals they put in clothes, and have high level of Formaldehyde in their textiles. It could be my daughter had a bad reaction to the chemicals or to the dye.

Amazon gave me a refund and I trashed the nasty dress.  I couldn't even give it away for fear it would hurt another child. However, Santa messed up big time!  My daughter didn't even want to wear it anymore.  As a parent I felt awful!!  I purchased the authentic Disney dress a few months later when my daughter's memories of the itchy Elsa dress had faded.  Now that it's been a while, she's not afraid to wear the new one.

NOTE - the Disney dress has caused ZERO problems"
Sizing is incorrect in these boots. I wear a women's 11 which is what I ordered. I tried them on without socks and my toes hit the end of the boot.. There should be at least a half inch for wiggle room to allow for socks. In addition to the sizing issue they have a very strong chemical smell. I will be returning these.
The top of these shoes get very uncomfortable  around my little too.
Fit is about two sizes smaller than expected from the size.  Gave mine away to a smaller friend.
Ordered an XL and it feels like a medium. Way undersized for an XL!
"didn't fit right, too shallow"
Wore it twice during some all-day conferences and the fabric was misshapen at the end of the day to the point where the creases would not line up correctly enough to run an iron from the waistline to the hem. Can not recommend these.
I always order from amazon and get good quality items I never thought I would get this poor of quality. Don't buy this it ok if you want something cheap but it feels like if you were to drop it. It would break very disappointed.
"I was excited to get my blouse today because I have a work conference in a few days and thought it would be perfect. I usually wear a 16 to 18, xl or 1x. The blouse is a nice lightweight cotton. I would recommend a camisole underneath. The blouse is a wrap style, but I think the front bottom will raise up and reveal some tummy view without a camisole underneath, plus the fabric is very sheer. I saw the reviews and ordered it in a 3x to make sure it fit. The blouse is very snug and fits more like a size L. I am not large busted, so that is not an issue.  The sleeves are very large and whoever put the buttons on the cuffs put them on the edge. Moving the buttons over is not an issue.  The main issue is the size of the body of the blouse. I will probably keep it, since I am losing weight and plan to be a size L.  The blouse was well made, the only problem is the sizing and it is way off."
Has a weird gap in the front . Was disappointed but won't return. I threw them in the thrift store bag. It was worth a try:)
"I have these two stars because the color is nice. But that's about it.  They fit horribly. The leggings are loose at the bottom and fit weird in the waist. I washed them hoping they would shrink a little, but now they're short and loose."
"These shoes are not for my feet. The arch support is non-existant. Sole is too thin in the front, in my opinion. Makes my toes go to sleep. I went with Skechers for the same price and I'm in heaven. I repeat, heaven."
"It is oddly shaped... it is very long but doesnt even seem to fit fully around my daughter who is 52 and 98 lbs. the material is very very thin. So if you are looking for something to use with your cosplay to keep you warm, or your ren faire costume to keep you warm, look elsewhere and spend alittle more. You will not be happy with this. This robe is basically for something like a high school play."
It's a cheap watch.  Can't expect too much.  The one thing I'll say is it's noisy.  If you don't hide it in your sock drawer at night you might go crazy from the ticking.
"I recently returned these sandals.  I received them as a gift in April 2012.  They were my favorite sandals, and I was sad to have to part with them!!  They were very comfortable.  But, I live in Maine where we are cold  and not in sandals for 8 months, and they only lasted a summer and a half.  I looked down one day and the left sandal was coming unglued from the tread--half of the glue was gone on one side.  Upon further inspection, the right sandal's toe was unglued.  I followed the washing instructions; however, I suspect that the washing may have been the problem.  Not sure.  But, they certainly STUNK after a few days on my lovely feet, so the washing machine was the only option.  They were great for the first year.  For something so expensive, I was really hoping to get at least one more year out of them.  Oh well!  Looks like other people have had problems with them falling apart.  It has been a really wet summer, so they have been wet more than they have been dry this year."
It's a beautiful watch however it was too big then had the nerves to break SMH Im going to contact cs for a replacement
This shirt is at least one sz too small. I can't stand the feel of material and one snag would destroy it
It's cute but the material feels horrible!
"however, if you are looking for the original ""Made in England"" Docs these are not it.  I just received my Made in England Docs today and let me tell you, they are far better constructed.  The leather actually feels like leather, it is stiff but with a little break in I'm sure this will subside.  I have always owned the Made in China version before this and they serve their purpose of about 1 to 2 years of life and then throw them away.  If you are looking for a boot that will last, spend a little extra money (only about $50) and get the real thing."
"They're HUGE.  I had no idea they'd be so big!  They're the biggest hoops I own, by far - down to my shoulders.  I look like a clown wearing them, which I've only done once because I was so self-conscious.  If you don't mind gigantic hoops, go for it.  If you're looking for something not quite so.... large.... these might not be for you."
"It would be perfect if it was a real woman's 2XL. It's more of like a junior's, if not a China 2XL (which is closer to a US M). The bust is smaller than what it should be, but the rest of it is a really good size. If you are over a 40C bra size then the 2XL will not fit."
Hat fits much smaller then other Flexfit's. The dome of the hat is very shallow.
"Although I'm not a textile expert, I'm pretty sure the one sent to me is not knitted wool at all, rather some synthetic knitting material. It is quite elastic and no wool or even cotton in the fiber. I took a very close look at the enlarged picture posted online. There is no similarity, not even knitting type. Very disappointed and frustrated. Waist of money and time."
Ordered a hoodless zippered sweatshirt in XL  size. What I received was a sleeveless hooded sweatshirt size XL that actually fit more like a medium. It took forever to receive the wrong product. I won't be purchasing from this store again.
"Very good looking shoes, but I'm not accustomed to wearing heels, so these actually hurt a lot.  Some reviews said to order a size down so that's what I did and the heel of the shoe just dug into my own heel, I felt that if I wore it for even more than a few minutes I would have cuts on both heels.  OUCH.  Good lookin' shoes though.  I think I should just buy heels in an actual store, so I can see what I'm getting myself into!"
They fit as expected but were uncomfortable so I returned them.
"I Ordered mens size 8 and got womens size 8. Aside from that, the quality seemed fine"
"I ordered a size 17, I have a muscular build, sleeves are long and arms are tight in the forearm area"
"it looks nice but you barely notice it on your finger...
i don't recomend for adult's hand but a child or teenager it's perfect!"
Absolutely adored these rings but they didn't fit. Incredibly bummed out.
WAS NOT BLUE AT ALL!
"Maybe it is me, but I cannot ""find"" the arch support on these sandals. My arches get no support - perhaps Teva thought the arch would be naturally supported because of the cut of the sandal, but for an almost archless foot, the support just isn't there."
do not like the way they fit would not buy them again
I was surprised at the discomfort given the reputation of the Brand Name.
"I did not realize when I ordered this bra that there was no support/lining in the cups for shaping. My left breast is slightly smaller than the right, but not enough to go down a cup size. In this bra, the fabric was bunching up on the left and even a little bit on the right. There was so much empty space that it looked ridiculous. I would have had to stuff my bra in order to make the cups rounded out (and I am not small-chested; C cup). The band and wide straps were very comfortable, but there was no way I could keep this with floppy, misshapen cups. Returned immediately."
So ugly and unflattering.
"Too small, it's a medium if you're  twelve years old."
Too big and no shape to it at all.
"The cup size is so tiny it'd fit an 8 year old girl.  So sad because it really is cute, but again fits  nothing like the picture shows."
The gold chain is kinked and cannot be fixed.  Not worth the price to send back.  The other two will be ok.  VERY thin and delicate.  Would not recommend.
"I ordered 2 of the same tops in different colors. One was properly folded but the other one was not. It was folded so the part of the flag embellishment was touching the other side of flag. Of course, being in the warm weather inside of the packaging they provided, the stars and stripes melted and became sticky so when I tried to unfold the shirt, they peeled off. Careless packaging and very cheap graphic material for flag"
Not as impressed as I hoped. Laces against the tongue are very uncomfortable.
"I purchased a small, and while I understand I'm fairly tiny, it looks like a ridiculous moo moo. I tried it on, laughed at how sad it was, never touched it again. I'm very dissappointed because the model shown wearing it and I are about the same in size, and that is definitely not how it looks on."
"Flying a lot, I always had suitcase envy when I saw folks effortfully pushing their suitcases so I decided to purchase this set.
Poor quality on the handle which feels week and unstable prevents you from trolling the suitcase correctly and when you try to just do the old roll on 2 wheels, it is very stiff,

Would not recommend at all, wish I could have gotten my money back,"
"As a veteran, I've worn shirt stays for over a decade. These don't cut it. I am 6'2"" and never had an issue with the shirt stays from the base exchange. These stays are too short and too stiff. At about 10"" long, fully extended, they are under full tension and it shows in your shirt. The first time that you sit down, at least one pops off.  On a final note, the ends are heat treated to prevent unraveling and are very sharp and uncomfortable."
"so, I followed the advice of other reviews, and ordered up a size, only to find that the item was too big. and also the style was not what I was looking for.  its not really a ""boy friend"" jacket - it's more like something preserved from the 80's ( been there, done that, although maybe the shoulder thing is coming back)"
"I always buy Alegria shoes because I have a lot of foot problems. They are pretty much the only shoes I can wear and walk for any period of time. I do wish they used better quality Velcro because after about a year you either need to replace the Velcro or the shoes. But since they're the only shoes that work, I buy them. I wear a women's 9 and I order a size 39 and the fit is perfect.
***Update: The last pair of shoes I bought, the velcro failed in 5 months! For shoes that are over $100, I expect way better than that. I contacted the company and they want me to pay to ship them back so they can inspect the damage. I do understand the need to inspect the damage, however I don't like to pay $15 to ship damaged shoes back with the chance the company could just decide that they have been heavily worn. I will probably try to find a shoe repair shop near me and have the velcro fixed there. I will start looking for another brand of shoes to buy. ."
"Just CUT these off, if your feet sweat at all you will never get these off..."
"The size didn't fit me as expected, and the color didn't satisfied me too."
too small to fit in ears. not happy.
"no colors, what a rip off"
"I have had a lot of good experiences with New Balances, but these shoes didn't really do it for me. The fit felt a little long in the toes and the color scheme looked better online then in person (the shoes seemed to have a glossiness / sheen to them)."
"I swear I purchased a medium, but I removed the tag before putting it on so I cannot verify if it truly is a medium. This sports bra was really big, especially the band around the bottom.
I wear medium in all my other sports bras. So either this one was a mistake or they run big. Unfortunately it's going to Goodwill as it's looseness irritates me. I'm not big in the chest dept but still, exercising with a loose sports bra is extremely distracting.
Quality wise it seems like a good product. Unfortunately because it was so loose I can't comment on its functionality."
Bulky and does not have enough hang on it.  It practically covered my mouth!
Made beautifully but way too small. Perhaps its my fault fo not buying wide width.
"I loved these shoes, they have a weird smell but who cares...lol... They are pretty high and the size does run bigger. I usually wear a size 8 in these type of shoes, so I read other buyers reviews befor I order them and I was aware of the size situation so I ordered them In 7.5, they are still a little big but I can wear socks with them and make them feel good. I think a 6.5 or 7 would have been perfect size, maybe these shoes run by normal shoe size and not high heel size. They are really nice though, they look good with skinny jeans and dresses... you have to get a pair!!

That is my review before I wore the shoes...Not happy at all. the first day I wore them the heal completely broke after wearing them for only 30 min., I had to literally buy another pair of shoes because I was away from home! It was so embarassing I wanted to hide. My husband tried fixing the shoe with crazy glue, garilla glue, and even apoxy, nothing worked...very disapointed. The smell of the shoe (plastic chemical)still hasn't gone away. Pretty...yes...quality...very poor!!!"
Returning this. Much smaller in life.
"Cute as all getout, but too small. I wear a 10 and had to return for an 11. The eleven fit but a 10.5 would've been perfect. Sizing aside, the shoe, when you can find your size, is very comfortable and looks so good!"
I have a high arch. There is no way to actually put my foot into these shoes.
"large and heavy , kid doesn't like it, uncomfortable"
"I really wanted these to work but the minute i put them on with shoes and started walking, they slipped off my heel while walking.. im giving them 1 star because i like the material and weight of the sock"
"The quality of these shoes is great! Apparently, I have skinny feet because these didn't touch me anywhere! They flopped all around on my foot. I am so sad! I even paid for expedited shipping to have them before Easter."
"As pictured, the bottom of this shirt should rest at the hips. I'm not that tall and it barely touches my waist."
"This bra missed the mark in every way. I am 5'3 and 200 lbs. Pretty average height. The bra straps are made for very call women. when the bra was place on my breasts appropriately I could grab a couple inches worth of fabric from the strap at the top of my shoulder. If i pulled the bra down so the straps fit correctly then the back of the bra went down to my waistline! I ordered my size based on the size chart and the band was tight with absolutely zero stretch so It's not like the bra was too big everywhere. So, unless you are 6 feet tall I wouldn't suggest this bra."
The anklets I ordered came to me broken and missing parts.
"This is a nice concept but it is so cheaply made! I recieved it and when I opened the box, two separators were already broken. Also it was messy inside as a result of the separator being broken it caused little saw dust like pieces to scatter. Not worth the price. I would return it, but I live in Trinidad and that was be very costly, maybe the seller can work out something for me."
The sizing info was not helpful so I bought the wrong width and had to return them.
"Color was more dull in person and it rolls up on me pretty badly. At the time I got it I was about 125lbs, 5'5"" and ordered small. I feel like I need to wear a tank under it because it seems oddly loose in the bust, almost like I have no bra on when I actually do. It'd be good for working out or sleep maybe but otherwise the quality isn't great."
The pair is a bit too large for a long walk.  Returned it for the exchange to a 1/2 size smaller pair.
"Liked the material and pockets.  Leg openings were way too big, fit was terrible.  Too short for me."
"The shorts were nice, but didn't fit properly for my son. We had to return it along with another pair of Nautica shorts."
These run small and narrow. I had to send them back.
The chain was tarnished very bad the pendent is ok will not recommend to anyone. Chain need to change or clean it befor shipping
It didn't look as good as the picture.  It looked like a cheap costume wig that was all matted and stuffed in a package.  I couldn't get it to look like the picture.
"This item is ridiculously tight an the double seam at the bottom shows right through if you wear a knit dress.

Attempted to return it but seller informed me there is no refund if item was tried on.  If this was made known to me prior to placing order, I would have thought twice about using this seller."
The chain gets tangled up like it gets links overlapped and can't stretch back to form.... Not very impressed
Not good enough to buy.
Cheaply made and when stretched its like a run in your pantyhose
"Disappointed - I have owned Dunham 4E's before and loved them.  This one is too tight in front, and it causes a significant amount of pain.  Unfortunately I was traveling when I first wore them, and didn't have a choice but to suffer through, so I'm stuck with them now.

They look great - but the pain isn't something that works for me."
These were suppose to be REAL lambswool & suede. I've only wore them a few days & the faux sheepskin is already pushed down & it looks like Ive had them for years. VERY DISAPPOINTED in the quality. These are NOT the brand name they claim to be.
I find that the stones fall out quite easily. I wasn't very happy with this product. I have purchased a better quality set but will keep these in case it's needed down the line.
Did not care for the shape of this one at all. The fabric seems ok and the fit was good. But it makes pointy boobs.
THE UPPER PORTION OF THE SHAPEWEAR SEEM TO BE TRUE TO SIZE BUT THE OPENING IN THE LEGS ARE WAY TO BIG !! THE HOOKS AND EYES IN THE CROTCH AREA FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE AND HARD TO OPEN WHEN YOU HAVE TO USE THE RESTROOM QUICKLY
"I was interested in these because of the price. I've been looking for sheer to waist black hose that I can wear with cutoff shorts without a dark panty area showing.

First off, these have an unsightly T-crotch. Secondly, they run small in width and long in length. It took a lot of pulling and adjusting to get them on, when I pulled them all the way up they went up comically high, all the way to my chest. Because they had to stretch so much to fit around my thighs, the T-crotch part stretched below where it's supposed to be and was visible when I tried my shorts on. Not cute. They're supposed to be non-control top but the waistband was still very binding and constricting. It also rolled down. The ankles were too big and not flat against my body, even though the rest of it was too small. The appearance is pretty much the same as L'eggs Sheer Energy, but they ran tighter and longer.

For comparison, I'm 4' 10"", 150lbs, pants size 10/12, and have 42"" hips, and I got size 3/4. If you are tall and have slender hips these might work for you. If you are short and/or a size 10 or larger, skip these."
"Feels cheap, plasticky"
"Not happy with how long it took to ship product. Also shirt is not as described, cheaply made. Material is stiff and see-through. Cannot give as a gift as intended and will have to purchase a shirt through someone else."
"dont buy thesepanties, they are like pantyhose cheap and waste of money"
Pants too tight in the crotch. Also too low in the back. Sent them back.
Not what I expected with the fit and everyone praised these shoes but I truly don't see that they are all that
Wide Fit. I returned.
When I got this product their was a horrible smell it stunk sooooo badly I definitely wouldn't recommend anyone buying this
"Brim is too short, much shorter than others and crown is also much shorter.  Looks funky (not in a good way) on my big head.  I probably wouldn't buy this again.  Hat looked like it had been washed before it arrived.  Shipping was great, but product quality was so-so at best."
The pants are more like capris. The shirt is very cute but runs very small. I bought a 2t for my 18month old and I wish I would have bought a 3t. He will only get to wear this shirt for a short time and he will not be able to wear the pants at all.
"This was to run small, so I order a larger size, but it was much TOO large.  Also - the fabric was extremely thin and that made the stitching difficult, and one side had puckered a bit from the stitching.
It was a rich color and I liked that, but because it was so thin, I had to return it."
This was a great looking sandal but the size narrow I ordered was simply too wide for me so I had to return them.
It's too big for my 2.5mo old who is considered a big girl..falls off easily and even tired shrinking it in the dryer.
foreign
UGH
"These earrings do not look like real silver. They are comfortable but look more like cheap, cosmetic jewelry you can buy at Kmart.  I haven't worn them much for that reason."
Very cheap looking. Looks like it would fall apart very easy.
"Has about a 3 inch inseam. If you want to cover more than your balls, these are not what you are looking for. The hand (feel) seems fairly good. The waist seems weak and I doubt they will last very long in that respect. I am a big guy and when I sit down they are about half way my ass. Hanes brand does not seem to do this. Just thought I would give these a try since they were a little cheaper. I am pretty disappointed
."
This particular shoe does not have enough support. I usually purchase Sketchers Premix which is a far better product which offers the padding and support I've come to expect from this brand.
"The dress is not as described. It is a shiny see thru material.  Amd especially made for someone who is at least 5'11"""
Timely delivery and great price but the zipper closed only half way up the leg.  This particular style is not for those with shapely calves.  I had to return them.
labeled swimdress as xxl but fits as a size medium.
"If your goal is to look like Buck Owens on hee haw, mission accomplished. Your new grandpa blazer has plenty of padding to protect you  from hurting yourself. Just pretend to pluck those strings like a boss. This sturdy piece made me feel like a real man, made my daddy proud. Don't forget to wear a giant  belt buckle to complete the look."
returned.  It was to large.
Doesn't fit like the picture shows!
"There was more cotton in the product than spandex so it tends to get out of shape due little elasticity.  Therefore, it was like wearing another pair of pants under my pants."
"Another overseas produced garment designed for fat Americans. Large Tall is exactly my size. Everything I've ever purchased in this size fits how it should (6'4"" 205lbs). This has the length you'd hope for in a tall size, but I could fit an extra person in it with me. The sleeves are especially oversized, could easily put my legs in The sleeves and where this shirt as a silly pair of pants. Too bad, like the way it looks. Returning."
I bought this March 27 for Easter Sunday- it said Id get it by Friday March 30 but I did not! The shipping immediately changed right after I completed my purchase! Seems a little deceptive! Its alao VERY small! Ive boughg similar blazers on here and always went with a 2x...this was more like a medium! Beautiful color though.
The seperations in the feather are sharp. The shape of the ring is awkward because the backside  is at a point so it doesn't lay right on your finger.
"I am an artist and quilt maker and appreciate the time and love which goes into creating art by hand. However, I bought the scarves based on description and photos. When they arrived, the two scarves were folded tightly together and were so loosely woven, and so stiff and coarse that I thought I had received half of one scarf. I finally got everything undone. I expected an entirely different fabric. The closest I can come to describing the fabric is insubstantial burlap. There is nothing intrinsically  wrong with the item except that I can't use it as a scarf. I may cut it into lengths and crochet them into a fiber project---I certainly won't waste hand spun silk. To satisfy your US  target market, I think you need to redo how you wrap and deliver the product, and you need to revise your product description on the Amazon sales page. The scarf itself could be improved by increasing the thread count per inch, and by making it longer. I'm sending my best regards to the artist who made the scarf, and wish you much success."
"Don't care for this shirt at all. WW have changed the way these shirts are made, sure ain't like they used to be. I ordered 3 of these shirts and wasted my money. Never again!!!"
Very big.  No grip at all!
"I tried to put these on and quickly realized that the left leg was made smaller than the right. I got the right side on but the left would not go up past my thigh. Also, they are not as sheer as I like and appeared to look more like tights than pantyhose. I returned them and ordered a different brand."
"I sent mine back. Too narrow, could hardly wear with one pair of socks, and the area for the ball of my foot was not well padded.
I got the New Balance Walkers instead and they are wonderful."
These are very cute. My son wanted  some toast socks and I couldn't find any for boys. This pack had one he could wear! The others I would give to my daughter. They fit him really tight and he said they were uncomfortable he is nine years old and wears a size 2.  The quality is very poor as well not soft or inviting.
The small holes made it hard to use.
This looks better online than in person. I love Patty but not this top. It runs really small and is not flattering.
Waist band stretched out when trying these on. Did not wear them for more than five minutes and they stretched out and were falling down. To bad bc they were cute before I moved in them.
"These are so stylish - just wish they were made according to size!  I wear a 12M and I'm not sure this style would fit a 10M. With a size 12, nowhere to go up so I had to sadly return them."
"I love the way these boots look and they're obviously well made of quality leather, but the quality is too good. By that I mean that the weather is so stiff it won't bend, the boots way and astronomical amount and are incredibly heavy on my feet. They are the least comfortable thing I've ever put on my feet and that includes snowboarding boots, ski boots, and pointe shoes. I'm so disappointed to have paid so much money for this well known quality brand of boots when they are the most uncomfortable thing I own, and after almost one year of trying to wear them, I still can't wear them for more than 10 minutes. Save your money get something more comfortable even if it doesn't last as long."
"Ships from China, so be prepared for long wait, even tho item description states Fulfilled by Amazon.  First time I'll say, ""you get what you pay for"".  Fits small, I sized up to a large, and it fits like a medium."
The quality is ok but the elastic does not hold.  You'd have to have a pretty big head to use the stretch. I really wanted to like these
I do not know what they want to call this fabric....but this is just the worst!  Itchy nasty ---son and I both HATE it.  Think of it as wearing Velcro.  Yup it's just that bad.
These run very small and dig in at the waist. I wanted something to wear under skirts not something that felt like sausage casing. The Skimmis Slipshort is a much better choice if you want something comfortable to prevent chafing.
"Not true to size, way too small"
The were too small and did not look as good as the picture.  I returned them for a refund.
"Wanted to keep these, but were just a bit too big to stay on my feet so had to return"
Was fine at first but I only got to wear it once and it got tangled and broke.
"I bought this product twice. One in March 2016, one just arrived yesterday. The medium was a bit tight around the hips and I wanted another so I went with an XL since they were out of L. It will not go over my hips. I checked, it is the same brand. The old one has a whole so I'm hoping I can cut up the new one and salvage this purchase by fixing the old one, but this is ridiculous. I shouldn't have to order 3 sizes up to get the same size 10 months apart! Also, this is described as ""plus sized."" Not even close!"
It was super tiny for somethings that's supposed to be a large
"Not only is this too big, it is awkwardly too wide. Terrible fit."
"very poor quality, cheap printing of pattern."
"Aside from fitting poorly, it was not the color that I ordered.

While I ordered a dark blue, what arrived was more of a turquoise blue (cerulean). Nor was the brand the same as what was pictures."
"Terrible terrible pants. Really stiff and uncomfortable, no flexibility whatsoever. You need one of those t-rex grip poles that bite things for you to reach anything below your knee. Pretty sure that if I tried to ride my motorcycle in these I'd have to amputate my legs. Go with something that stretches"
"Stiff as a board. Washed the bags to try and make them more pliable but it didn't work. The fabric is like cardboard. Waste of money. I will go back to using plastic grocery bags. At least I'm recycling and they're free (the grocery bags). I will use these ""shoe bags"" to store junk in my garage. Come on Amazon, please go back to selling quality products. I can't rely on Amazon to sell quality products anymore--it's like a junk flea market online."
The size seems to be a really small fit for age.
There is a terrible smell as it would made from tire rubber. Very tight. Absolutely crab.
"Did not get what I ordered! This seems to be a pattern with the seller  careless & poor attention to his work! Earrings are quite thin  quite fragile & in size somewhat small, specially if one has long hair. Nevertheless, the size is not as bad as getting the opposite of what I paid for in this order!"
"These boots are very smalli bought a nine. I doubt they would fit an eight!  I
will be returning them!!"
Poor quality and too small.  Returned shirt.
It doesnt fits all sizes very disappointed
Smells horrible and looks nothing like the picture!  I had to wash it 3 times before I could try it on!!
I bought the bag a while ago but didn't use it until now. Right away zippers were breaking and things were falling off. Plus the leather feels very cheap. I wish I could get my money back but it might be too late.
Did not fit runs really small. counld not wear at all
Thought I could handle the thin and sheet like material...bit the stitching was horrible and poorly made overall. Seriously a waste of money and time. Amazon seems overrun with poor products lately.
"what I got was not what I asked because it is not the same pack photo. I received the blue shirt, red was another design and instead the yellow I get a blue shirt and the cotton of yellow shirt was of low quality."
Asian sizing.  Much smaller than expected.
The woman in the pic models it much better.  OMG it gave me shelf in the back and I looked preggers.  Sending back.
NOT AS EXPECTED.
Junk.. canvas covered coardboard.
"These flats suck, i got blisters every time i wore them, i was in pain at work when i would wear them and my feet would get sore. The flats never broke in as flats usually do, it just got worse."
"These are not Buffs. If you are looking for actual Buffs or something even remotely close, order something else. These are the same material as those stretchy book covers but of even lower quality.  The edges frayed as soon as I looked at them and the seams are very obvious.  Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money or time."
Not the best quality. Button stopped working after first use.
These shoes are very narrow. Not the typical New Balance that I am used to. I will stick to the 574 version.
"This gown material is terrible, after one wash it created lent balls all over it, after while I threw it in the trash, because I just did not feel it was worth spending shipping and handling sending it back, I would never order a gown from this company. POOR MATERIAL!!"
AGAIN ANYTHING COMING FROM CHINA......DO NOT ORDER...TOO SMALL ALWAYS EVEN IF YOU ORDER XXLARGE
"These leggings are awful. The fleece lining is what gave it two stars. But I'm 5'4"", which is not very tall, and they don't even reach my ankles. Also, they are constantly sliding down to reveal my crack. Not just once or twice throughout the day, they slide down pretty much immediately after I pull them up and keep walking. I hate these and I wish I had realized that early enough to get a refund."
"""Stone""- plastic, rattles in the setting"
"technical writing was misleading.  States both wirefree AND ""Wide fleece lined wings and encased underwire for comfort"".  Asked for refund on both item as well as return shipping.  Company did not refund entire amount."
It didn't have a long enough torso.
"I decided to by these shoes because of the great reviews everybody was leaving, so I was very excited to get them in the mail. Only to find out that the right shoe fit ok and the left shoe fit too small. That was weird. Normally it's the other way around because the right foot is bigger. I would have asked for an exchange, but I was not all that happy with the quality of these shoes, the fit was a bit awkward. They are definitely not good enough for me."
"I am sure it is a matter of opinion, but I did not like this blouse due to the cut out shoulders.  It just looked tacky and cheap.  The fabric was nice, and the fit was good, but I just felt that it was not appropriate for me personally.  But you can't beat the price, so if it's your thing, then go for it."
Cheaply made...over priced.
"My daughter loves Saucony sneakers, but we returned these due to the poor construction in the velcro closure.  The velcro only lies across the flap and so over time will lose its effectiveness.  My daughter's other Saucony sneaker (Excursion, Cohesion, Kotaro) has a more secure/sturdy velcro."
"the shoes are not what was expected, very stiff material and uncomfortable, would not order again"
Came in a bag (crushed) and reformed with perma cracks. Too small for a 23 inch head (considered a standard Large by the amazon men's hat sizing chart). Good for kids but recommend something else for adults.
"Nice little kit, although I thought it was much bigger, especially for the price."
Ouch!  These shoes are so painful.  I even lined them in padded tape and they still blister and scar my feet.  They are going in the garbage.
"purchased these because of the glowing recommendations.  Well, they are not as described. They were pulling up the toenails on my feet through the socks, and I never even got my orthotics in! My foot measures a 6.5 but I get a 7.5 so I have plenty of room for my arch supports.  These were way too small. Worse is that DREW REFUSES To give me a refund! Do not do business with these people! I have $385.00 worth of shoes from them, unworn and in the boxes, they have refused to give me a refund on. Really? Are they that desperate for money? Guess one customer really upsets their bottom line! I have found Merrill's, which fit much much better, are extremely comfortable, and I have yet to put in any orthotics, they are that well designed.  DRew has been living off their reputation as a quality good fitting shoe for too long. I am doubtful of the quality, the fit just isn't there, and they are not good people to do business with.  I think they have been bought by the Chines and no longer give American service!"
This did not look like the picture.  The decal was way too big for the shirt and the shirt ran extremely small.  My son's belly showed if he lifted his arm the slightest bit.  Every other shirt that is 3T fits him fine.  Decal also looked as if it could easily be peeled off.  This shirt got returned quickly which was disappointing since I was really looking forward to him wearing it for his birthday.
"I meant to return it, but the design was the one that I was looking for. BUT, I couldn't ware even a 1/2 hour. It was too painful. I don't have big feet. I usually ware size regular 7. it's definitely too narrow for the front part."
This shoe does give me the support I need.  It almost like its flat and when working out in the shoe it's not what I expected. I need to examine another brand...
"THEIR SIZE CHART IS ALL WRONG. I measured myself and ordered according to their chart but the dress I received is horribly big. Now I'm stuck with it because it costs too much to return. Don't bother. But if you do try, order AT LEAST one size smaller than you normally wear (although I would definitely recommend ordering two sizes smaller, honestly). Basically,  stay away."
"not durable at all, sole separating after only 3 wears"
"I wore these across campus and each step was painful.  For some reason, these were especially painful for the big toe on my right foot.  Additionally, my heal slipped out with every step.  I wear an 8.5 or 9, so these must run big (I ordered an 8.5).  Or maybe I just got a big pair.  At any rate, regardless of them not fitting well, I also really don't like the look of the toe in person.  It really does look like the toe of a cowboy boot.  If you like that look, then maybe you'd like these.  It wasn't the look I was going for AND they didn't fit well.  I gave them to a coworker since I'd already worn them across campus and the soles showed that wear.  Oh well."
"The problem with buying this cardigan - regardless of color - is that you don't know what you will be getting. I ordered multiple cardigans in different colors; sometimes the item arrived would not be as pictured, e.g., the collar would be round instead of v-neck. However, since you can return for the item for item, there's no harm in trying it out."
Bought for birthday of a senior cancel survivor in nursing home. Very unhappy that the size is off by art least one whole size. Too small to fit cripple's foot...shame...shame.
I ordered a small size because I am normally a size 4 but the bolero fit too tight on the sleeve. It looks like an XS. The bolero ruffle on the front and back did not work out for my outfit. Lace material is strechy.
These were not original Prada Sunglasses. they weigh less than originals and looked different. I compared them at a store with the real product and was disappointed with these.
really stiff shirt and wrinkles easy
I got these for my son. I thought they would be good for school and fall. Bit they are practically mesh! See through! I got them cheap. Should have known. He would have to wear shorts under to wear these to school! Not worth returning
"I have had other swimwear by this maker, and loved it.  This is gross.  Granny panty up halfway to your boobs style.  Gross gross gross.  I am a curvy woman wanting a regular bikini style bottom, and this was not the answer.  For the record, in the purchase listing, it also said this was below-the-navel in style.  Not hardly.  That said, the fabric quality was nice.  If you're looking for a big ol' granny panty bottom, this may be your thing."
"These just arrived today. This shoe shows all of my toes' cleavage, and the cutout around the toe area is crooked on one shoe. Returning"
"REALLY PRETTY, BUT MADE CHEAP"
The top of this suit does not fit well...
Looks great right off the bat but the strings break very quickly with normal use and before long it looks just like the jeans you cut the legs off as a kid to make shorts.  Its looks great out of the box but just doesn't last as long as a season would require.
"Its only $7,99 and my expectations where on the low side to begin with, considering the price with shipping included. And I was right, its flimsy, barely worth the $$. UNTIL I decided to wash my hands and wetted it. Next morning it was flooded with moisture. Has to make a tough decision. Either never again wash my hands (let not even think about taking a shower) or return it. Guess what side won.

Not for scuba diving, but ANY watch should be at least water RESISTANT. This one is not. Stay away."
"These were ridiculous. The plastic is so stiff, it's impossible to wear these boots. Sort of like putting two garbage cans on your feet and trying to walk in them. Not what I expected. If you have small feet, these might look better, but on me they looked huge and were not comfortable at all."
"These shoes were a disappointment. I should of taken the advice of the other buyers. They are made for a narrow foot, They are too pointy for tennis shoes.
They do not fit at all. I did go up a 1/2 size. No disrespect for the other reviews, but a properly made shoe does NOT need to be broken in. These shoes are obviously poorly made and it is VERY rare for this brand."
"What is going on with online clothing all of a sudden? Used to be able to make fairly decent purchases of name-brand clothing online at fair prices. Not anymore...EVERYTHING I've purchased online in the last six months that is clothing related has been absolute garbage including these boxers which were again, NOT TRUE TO SIZE. I get that things are being made all over the world now and that sizes vary but if it's sold in the US shouldn't US sizes apply? SMH..."
"I'm so disappointed, I needed these in a hurry and prayed the size I bought based off of reviews would fit, but they didn't. Other reviews said they ran big and that you should order a size (at least) down. I shouldn't have, and even then, I'm not confident they would've fit still. My poor baby's sausage feet were too wide/tall to get his foot in. Other reviewers must have been thinking of length only. I'll need to see if I can stretch them out for him to somehow still use them.

He usually wears a size 6(T) and I bought the size 5. I'll post pictures soon for you to reference too."
I have a somewhat narrow foot and these accommodate people with Flinstone feet. Also they are surprisingly heavy for flip flops. I tried the ten and my toes went off the front. the eleven was way too big. I went with the TEVA Toachi 2 instead and am liking them a lot more.
I usually buy myself a new pair of slippers every winter and toss the old pair.  Unfortunately these slippers are very low quality and after two weeks of wearing them they had pilled up and looked old and battered.  I would not repurchase these slippers at all and am headed to costco to get my usual pair of dear foams.
Small was too small:(
"Arms too short, as is the jacket"
These won't stay up on my calves unless I wear another tall pair of socks over them.
"I really like the simplicity of this flat, but I just couldn't get over the amount of toe cleavage it shows and ended up returning them. I'm not a fan of being able to see any of the spaces between my toes in a shoe, and this didn't come close to having a high enough vamp to cover that. I really loved the color, though, and am having a hard time finding a similar alternative. I didn't have them long enough to break them in, but I did find that the heel dug in slightly and that the shoe felt close to slipping off when I walked (I believe because it was a little wide), which may have gotten worse as the shoe stretched with wear, though I can't say that for certain."
"The shortness of this makes it look weird. It is not as long as pictured, barely covers my butt."
"Super adorable Suit BUT I am a 36DDD bust and the elastic inside the suit was way too big. It didn't get tight enough to support my boobs. Had I went down a size in the swim suit, they would have been falling out the top. I wish there was some way to alter the elastic because this suit is adorable otherwise. I am 5'4 180lbs. Hope that helps!"
This hat came folded weird and the brim was all messed up and I look like a total weirdo maybe I have a small head not sure but I don't think I will be wearing this in public
"Way too small,"
"the jeans fit a bit large but I don't mind. The decorations instead is a bit of a problem. I can definitely feel them when I sit on a wooden bench or on the floor. I should have known. I still like them.
It's been a few more weeks and to my horror I now have noticed that the decorations on my jeans have scratched my wooden chairs. Because of this I am assigning a lower star value to this product."
"I have these shoes in the burgundy suede and I LOVE them!!  So soft and comfortable iI could literally wear them every day so when I saw these I had to have them.  They are beautiful!  The perfect little statement piece for the wardrobe.  However, the binding around the edges make this shoe very uncomfortable.  Totally different fit and feel than the suede.  I will be returning them.  What a disappointment :("
"Lovely pattern, hideous fit. COMPLETELY see-through. Returned."
"I was really disappointed in this one. As previous reviewers stated, there is not much to offer for busty women. Had to return."
"The first day I wore this bra I was impressed by how comfortable it was.  The support was great.  The next time I wore it I felt the underwire poking me.  When I took it off, I found that the underwire is not secure.  It shifts.  I was able to move it back into place but it doesnt stay there.  Very disappointing."
Runs a size smaller. Soles are slippery on smooth walking surface. Wished I hadn't made the purchase. Decent price but overall buyer beware.
"Super hard and extra padding - very high mid section. This bra was entirely unattractive and matronly - not really like the picture. The material is nice but somewhat hard...for the price, it should have been more satisfying. Returned."
Chest area is too small if you wear a 38DD. I purchased a 2x
"The material is SO thin, not at all like my bow Uggs. I believe the reviewer that said they are fake."
"Material is cheap feeling, but I have yet to give them the wear test outside.  I don't know how they will hold us. material is definitely not rubber or even rubber like. It is dry and very light............it might be good."
Way too small. I do not recommend even trying to buy this product.
"Item is too small, runs a size smaller thzn what you wear so buy big! Not worth paying more money to return!"
"I love these slpers and even bought a second pair in a s,alley size. But they stretched out and kind of flop. They are super comfy and warm. I only gave them a 2 bc it's hard going up and down the steps in them. Especially carrying laundry or toys. I really wish they didn't stretch out"
Requested to return item.
Designed for people with ultra skinny feet and legs. My package went straight to the Salvation Army.
It's beautiful but it was a bit constricting and not very flexible. I also have a somewhat longer torso and this seemed short. I returned it.
They run extremely large and the opening is huge. They looked completely ridiculous on yet so cute off...
"I bought this for myself being an Amazonian, but the fit is ridiculously small.  Its so small that my wife wears it as a cozy around the house kind of shirt."
"While the shorts were ok, the sewing on the seams of the Tshirt were very poorly done. Not the quality I was expecting."
"Nice looking but cheapy made glue on seams. About 5 different spots ,thin and no tread. Not made for snow or rain wearing."
"I bought these shoes in black and love them...the straps on the black are more flexible and comfortable - I wore them all day as soon as I received. The straps on the gold, however, are very rigid, no give at all. Also, the upper straps are far too loose. Had to grip shoe with toes as I walked to keep it on. Sadly, will be returning - no point in having a pair of this usually great brand if you cannot wear them comfortably."
"very high, very uncomfortable platforms, I have not yet released"
"Weird fit. The elastic around the waste seems loose and falls below my waste when I'm wearing it.  I purchased a S/M, as recommended by the reviews I read prior to ordering. I'm 5'4, 150lbs."
This shoes is not what I expected! Looks nice but fits horribly. The material is too hard. Runs small! First time I bought this brand and would not buy again!
"The picture does not properly reflect how poorly constructed the shoe is made. My balls of my feet ached badly and the heel did not support the back making as though I was walking in flip-flops. The soles were heavier than most shoes I buy. Luckily, Amazon promptly refunded my purchase."
"Big and frumpy...fit was odd, huge for a medium, and i'm not sure a small would have fit any better."
"The beads are pretty cheap looking. The quality is not that great.  I wasn't expecting too much from this bracelet, and I'm glad because I really didn't get much.  I wore it once and some of the beads are already coming off.  I wish I hadn't bought it."
Not sure why but the footbed was very hard and hurt my feet. Super cute though!  Still love love crocs!
Too small. They should really figure this out already. Would not recomend
smelled terrible and too small.
To big and don't stay together very well
"It was too snug for my expectation. I bought a small. I'm 126 lbs. 34-26.5- 36.
It was also too long..like at least 2 -3 inches if you are not wearing a footwear..
Definitely not recommended for work.
I bought the olive color and returned it.
I bought it through Amazon prime,  it also showed to have free returns.
But when i was about to return it, they said it is not covered for free return..and that I had to pay for my shipping. Thus ended up paying to return this thing back !"
"Its a cute backpack, but it started falling apart in the first week of my daughter having it. The handle at the top ripped off. The second week the buckles to adjust the straps stopped holding. And 5 weeks after getting it, there are holes in the bottom. Cute, but poorly made."
Dont even bother orderering.  Cheap material and the fit is way off.
"What can I say, just didn't like it"
Color is not bright. Design not flattering to body. Material cheap.
Took 4 weeks to arrive. Not the tall version as well. Not what i was expecting.knockoff version.
I'm returning the shoes
"Great fit and great to wear in and around pool. However, Right shoe tore at seam after one wear. Not a quality product for the cost."
"Somewhat cheap. There was a hole in the pocket when i recieved
them.  Not on the seam, bu
but missing material about the size of a dime."
I ordered this bra at size 34DDD and it fit more like a 32H. I think this company needs to warn buyers about their difference in sizes compared to other manufacturers or they should check their products more closely to ensure the right size tags are being put on the proper bras.
"I don't understand the way this size is supposed to work - I ordered a Medium size, Petite fit. Apparently that's not how Alfred Dunner thinks. The pants didn't fit - much too baggy."
"These are soft and pretty, but the material is seriously heavy duty.  If stretched, I'm sure you could launch cannon balls with these things.  The lack of elastic around the front of both legs make the panty creep up in back."
"Ordered these earrings, and they broke after the first use. Cheap Cheap CHEAP made product.. Buyer beware. You have been warned"
"The Shoes are Beautiful..I love the style. The left shoe felt great.

The right shoe fit very lose. It's not my feet either I received 2 pairs of Pumas today. the other pair fit perfect. To be honest it looked like the right shoe was stretched out. My wife said it was probably because someone with a big foot tried it on. I don't know what it was but it was too large to the point it was slipping off my foot."
"The design of this band is nice, and it fit true to size, but the quality of the diamonds was just so poor that I had to rate it two stars and returned this item.  The photo shows clear bright diamonds, but these diamonds really are a murky grey and looked especially dim next to my diamond engagement ring.  For the price, you can get something at least as nice in a local jewelry store, and for a little more, you can get something that really stands out.  Pass on this one!"
Never received
These are very soft and cute but the cut is HORRIBLE! I ordered an XL and it came mid rise to my abdomen. Maybe for my 10 year old niece...MAYBE... disappointed and would NOT buy again
looks good but is very narrow and somewhat small.  The shoes was posted as running large which was the exact opposite of what I experienced.
"Doesnt look like pictured item at all, feel like the pictured item is different material, please reconsider this item before you buy it."
The jeans are nice but i have now returned them twice. one size is too big so i went down a size and can't even get them on  the sizing is crazy
"Fit is very small for a men's medium.  It wasn't worth returning, so i'll gift it to my nephew who is 12 years old.  Material is thin t-shirt quality."
"While these are super cute, they are THE MOST uncomfortable shoes I have ever owned in my entire life!! The footbed is hard as a rock! I don't know why so many other people say they are super comfortable because they are hard and stiff and cut into my feet. I'm hoping I can still return them. I bought them a couple of months ago and since it's still rather cool here just haven't had the chance to wear them until yesterday. For the price I paid, they should be perfection but they are not."
color looks nothing like the photo..should be burgundy..looks burnt orange  :(
"Plantar Fasciitis was definitely aggravated by these shoes, little to no ankle support, the foam just buckles after a few weeks, they are too soft to wear for me, I'm 6'1"" 275lbs and I had to stop wearing them after just one month."
Too big for my taste. Was hoping more for a Lennon look.
I gave them to my daughter.
"I bought these quite a few months ago and have been most disappointed. The little ""toe grip"" was hardly there and the material on the sole lasted about 4 months before wearing down at the heel from concrete sidewalks. I peeled the stuff off from under the arch and glued it on the heel to make them last longer. Now it's worn down to the wood again. (Mine may have been the last of the ones made with wood.) I'm not going to buy these any more, which is sad, as they were my ""mainstay"" for many, many years. The ""original"" quality is gone."
To small even for daughter who is not over weight.
The color was way off from what was described so returned it for another brand and color
Going by measurements it is too small and I spent the whole day pulling it down so it would ride up over my hips.
accentuates too much of my behind. Cannot wear to work
Tore within one month
Gave these to my mom because even for a size 15 they were huge
"These shoes look great on the site; however, I wear a size 11 and these are way too big!  My heels come directly out of the back and I literally have ""walked out of my shoe"".  The heel feels less than strong - wobbles back and forth."
These ran way too big.  I gave these for a gift to my daughter and she hasn't worn them or returned them.  Probably will not buy clothes on Amazon again.
"You can't see the back in the photo so beware if you've got buns they aren't gonna make it in this suit. The slashes look like they're made with scissors, and there's no form keeping the girls up! Unflattering!"
Sent back got a med. fit like a XL
"Don't buy it.  Material stinks--too hard to wash and dry and creates static..  Way more than advertised,  Keep away if you're a stout girl.  Crotch doesn't fit right.  I threw them awayl"
I thought the Go Walk 3's would have the same fit as the Go Walk 2's. Not so.  The 2's are much more comfortable than the 3's and what ever improvements there are in the 3's are negligible.
"This ring did not hold up, turn color lose sapphire."
"the shirt is a low quality, stiff cheap fabric, not comfortable, super extra long men's shirt (I ordered a large) and it looks like something went wrong w the printing of the graphic- like the color ran or they ran out of ink- it's not black either, just gray. And it took weeks longer to get her than it sad it would. Disappointed."
"Not what I expected. A bit disappointing. Fabric is a cheap cotton, so its a bit uncomfortable. The 'string bow' is awkward looking as well."
"Only good thing was it came in 2 weeks early. Well I ordered a medium, and my breast were popping out the sides. The bottoms fit small, snug on my butt cheeks. Plus the line on the top is red. Wish I could send it back for a refund to buy a different bikini. This wasn't what I was expecting at all."
"I received this bag late yesterday afternoon and it was ready to be shipped back last night.  Sent it back today as the ups was closed by the time I checked it and printed off what I needed to send it back.  I will say I liked the size and the looks of the bag but I did not like the top zippers at all.  Cheaply made plastic and I could not even get one of them opened on the top.  The side ones opened easily enough but closing was a little hard but figured with use they would get easier.  The top ones were a different story.  Like I said I could not get one open and the other two opened and closed so hard that I was afraid I was going to break them.  Wish I would have taken heed to the reviews that stated about the zippers.  Would I recommend this to anyone.  Absolutely not and that is because of the zippers mainly. Gave it two stars because I liked the looks, feel and size of the handbag but not the zippers which was one of the main reasons for buying it."
the label size tag read 36-30. That's what I ordered. The size was actually 38-30. Not American Made either. The pockets were double. A pocket within a pocket. Made it difficult to retrieve items in the placed in the pockets. A Good word for the pants would be Junk
Shrinks after a wash tremendously. Also the threading at the bottom is coming undone. One more wash and this shirt will be ruined
"I ordered size S, its pretty tight when I was 18wks. returned them, go with real maternity clothing line. a lot more comfortable"
"These are described as helping your feet align. They flop around like thick pancakes. If you have serious foot issues: metatarsalgia, tendonitis, arthritis -- these are not for you."
"I have purchased many shoes online and also have ""Softspots"" in another style.  These shoes are at least 2 sizes short and wide width even though they were listed B(M) width.  I was afraid to order another size because you have to pay return shipping.  I paid 10.50 (2 pair) to find out these did not come close to the correct size."
"I have an extremely high arch, a wide foot and large calves. So, It may fit someone with the average wide foot. However, the zipper would not zip up, and I tried to zip it without my foot in the boot. The zipper was damaged and seemed cheap. It was not a high-quality zipper."
"Looked great, but was way too small. I broke it while putting it on. It was a waste of $12.00, but I should have read more of the reviews from others. "
I wanted grey boots and these are closer to blue.
"This was a surprise to me since I am loyal to Hanes. I did not like the fit or feel of these t-shirts. They were itchy, not soft at all. I found them to be rather tight. I will probably wear them to bed if that. A big let down."
Nice quality but not the size that they say
Fit is for wide feet!
"It's a very pretty bracelet; however I should have read the reviews before purchasing because it did turn pink. I was under the impression the bracelet was .925 sterling silver. Unfortunately, I would not purchase again."
"WAAAAAYYYYYY too short.  I am 135 5'6 and usually wear a medium, but this made me feel like a giant.  Not sure ordering a size up will help since it was wide enough just not long enough."
very poor quality.
"My wife normally wears a large, but ordered an extra large to be safe. This dress fits but is very tight to the point that it would be inappropriate for her to wear to work. The shiny material is a bit odd and would not be comfortable to wear regularly."
"I am 5'3'' and weigh 105 lbs.... these were way too big.  I had to send them back.  The other pair of leggings I got from another company here on Amazon fit just fine, and they were also ""one size fits most.""  These seem to run large for us smaller gals....  But they were cute."
"I bought this for my granddaughter in December 2016, but didn't give it to her until her 4th birthday in April. So she's had it just over a year. About 3 months ago, we noticed the music would stop playing after a short period. We end up just tapping the ballerina and we can get some of the music to play. She's very upset and wants me to get her a new one. I'm upset because while this box is very pretty, and perfect for a young child that loves ballerina's it is very small. I feel for the money paid, it should have lasted much longer. I am the one who winds it up each night, not my granddaughter, so I know I'm not over-winding it. I will try to contact Lenox to see if there is some type of warranty, but based on other reviews, I don't think they will be of much help."
Heavy and droopy - doesn't retain any shape to it at all.  Not worth even half the price!
"awful quality,  garbage DO NOT BUY"
Disappointing. I thought this blouse would have a distinct flare at the bottom. It didn't. It is not flared at All. Too tight in the waist. And I ordered a 3x! I returned it. Bummer.
"I've been on a shoe hunt for slippers for the past 3 months and I've become very frustrated. I've order from many brands, primarily through Amazon, and this is my honest detailed review.

Overall: These slippers are very basic, not what I'd expect from a Dr. Scholl's brand. Seems more like a generic brand that'll find at a local drugstore... poor material and construction.

Foot/Arch Support
There is NO foot support, which I figured a Doctor brand would have some.

Inside Cushion/Softness
Thin cushion inside. You will definitely feel like you are walking on a hardwood floors, if you're walking on hardwood floors LOL.

Outside Material/ Design / Color
The fur on the foot is the best part and the reason why I ordered it. However this isn't good enough to not return these slippers due to other issues. The color is as shown along with the design.

Bottom Grip
The bottom seems slip prone as the bottom grip is barely functional. It is more of that cheap rubber that barely makes the cut as a bottom shoe grip. So do NOT walk on wet surfaces or outside (please no).

Sizing/Width
The size seems true to size, as I ordered a XL (which I'm usually a size 10 = L) and they were too big. These slippers are also on the wide side oppose to a medium/regular size, so it would be hard to wear these without socks (if your feet isn't extra wide).

Longterm Prediction
Based off my experiences, with other slippers like these, I do not feel like these will last and probably will rip/tear quickly. The material on the bottom will either crack or the slipper will separate from the bottom as my other slippers similar have done. These are no different than any non-name brand slipper on the market.

Final Verdict
I RETURNED THEM. These slippers are just not worth the price in my opinion based off of experience. I've tired and reviewed Dearfoams, Dr. Scholl's, Isotoner, Sketchers, Vionic and more on Amazon and still had no luck. I will keep trying and keep you posted... please follow my page for updates and more reviews. I hope this helped :)"
"I receive a spring clasp and knotted boxed chain. As I told the sell, if I was not in such a need I have returned it to them. Their reply we will work at doing better"
Most of the suits I have ordered have not been true to size. This was a very cute top but the cut of the suit was just odd. Happy for the accepted return.
Very cheaply produced product.
"The arch support on these is so aggressive that after wearing them around the house for about an hour my feet felt like I was standing on rocks and the entire next day my insteps were bruised feeling and I felt like I had shin splints. I don't care if these are considered ""top of the line"" or not, but if they kill your feet to the point of disability they might as well be $10 Dollar General shoes. Very stiff and supportive for backpacking but I thought them to be overkill unless you are doing serious  mountaineering. Definitely not for day hiking even if you plan to hike in rocky and hilly terrain."
"Perhaps I received a poorly made model, or perhaps all these hats are much, much too large.  I have a normal sized (at least) head, but this silly things would not even grasp my head.  I had to return it.  Too bad, because I do like the style.  If only the manufacturer would size it properly so it can be used on a normal sized woman's head!"
"I always fit into an 11 with Asics. But this is too big. Something changed. Also, it has support but the stability is less that what was expected. Gel Forte fits me the best, so I ordered that instead and the pair fits great!"
My kid is petite and these shirts were way too wide and long. Better suited for larger children. Returned.
"Got 2 weeks use out of the ring.
Always wore on clean dry hands only.
On the 14th day turned finger GREEN!
Description says plated with silver. Silver what,  I don't know.
Guess you learn if it does not specifically say plated with ""Sterling Silver 925"".
Complete waste of money for me.
I wasn't wanting a 2 week disposable ring."
The inside of the soles fell apart within a week. Disappointing.
I now have two new skin-tight nightshirts...
Hate it!!! It's too big and too stretchy. It's not tight like a corset should be... elastic material
"Laces cut right through the eye-holes on top-most eyes.  I had to put in some gromets to allow me to use the top holes without further tearing/cutting of the holes.
Soles on heel are some kind of laminate and are peeling off.  Rubber is peeling off of right shoe and heal (top back) is peeling from left shoe.

This is after 1 week.

Avoid these shoes.

I've had $15 shoes to big-box-mart last a lot longer than this.

In my photos you can see the sole de-lamination and the eyelets I had to add to keep the eyes together."
"Well, despite some reviews about these running somewhat big, I ordered my true size. I always order my true because reviews for every shoe have complaints about running big or small and I've never had a problem so far. I'm always a 7 and the 7 always fits perfectly. These were too big. And wide. I'm disappointed and I need to return them. Despite the obvious quality and the fact that they are a nice shoe, I don't think I will try another size. They don't seem to be the right fit for my  foot."
"After reading all the reviews, I ordered too large a size.  Also the lace V on front is scratchy."
"I did not receive this item I ordered. Instead, I got a pair of yellow gold hoops. So now I have to wrap them back up, go to kinkos to print out the return form, buy a new envelope and set up a pick up the with UPS. What a pain."
I have bought Savane pants from Costco before and they fit fine. These are smaller by two sizes. I wear 38 these fit like 36 even thou they say 38?
The look of the necklace is great but after wearing it for about 1 month it started to turn my neck green and I NEVER EVEN wore it is the shower.  I do not recommend purchasing this necklace if you want to have it for a long time.  Not worth the money. I would buy sterling silver instead from now on.
"The order was for a large petite which indicated on the package the pants. On opening the plastic wrapping, I found size small and it wasn't petite either. No way I can wear a small."
"So disappointed to update my review to one star. Wore these twice and it looks like they've been worn, used and abused for a while. The leather layer is as thin as a paper sheet. No good quality here. I've asked for a refund as these are not worth 80. It's so unfortunate because the shoe style is so perfect to me."
The blue is closer to grey. I should have researched 6mm because the pearls are very tiny.
"Very thin, super-light fabric. Quality of shirt  unimpressive. I need to repair it before I will wear it."
"This belt was torn almost in half after about the first two weeks of wearing to school 4 days per week.  We would love to return this belt, but unfortunately it is past the date returns are allowed.  Very disappointed because its very cute and would be perfect for uniform belt.  My daughter wanted the gold instead of the silver ones, so we chose this one.  The silver ones held up beautifully, but she cannot wear this anymore, as it is torn and non-functional at this point.  :("
"Looks like a $25 shoes. For that kind of price I expect more, maybe two set of strings built like a scheckers..."
Once you wash it it gets the furry balls.
"the glue job on the insole to the bottom of the show is so bad that it left wrinkles and bubbles leaving the shoes painful to wear. This is the second pair that I have ordered the first ones' top leather cracked after four weeks of wear. Skechers shoes have a good reputation, but perhaps they should review their quality control."
"fit fine.  simply an ugly shoe.  I'm a grandma and old, but I don't like wearing shoes that look like grandma shoes."
Unwearable.  The material is so cheap that they don't unwrinkle after you wash them.
I have never had a problem with JRENEE shoes. A little hard.
it's suckwithout any outpackageafter delivered there s many scratcheslook like fake
So cute but too small!
"Bought these boots in March with nothing but hearing praise of the brand. Here I am in October of the same year, and the boots have about blown out. I do work construction but still these should have lasted longer. The laces broke with in the first month. The stitching on the heel of the boot has been coming undone since May.  The rubber toe and tread have almost been stripped away. The only thing that hasn't let me down is the comfort of the boot."
Loved the socks. It is very disappointing that one of the pair of socks had a hole in it the first time I tried to put the sock on. Colors of the socks are good.
"The product is terrible. The size I choose is absolutely the correct size. The slipper just will not stay on my foot. When I walk it comes off and in my impression is dangerous, especially going up and down stairs. When walking stairs it comes off the foot and will likely cause a fall trying to keep it on. I am returning the item to look for a better quality slipper."
The material is good but the fitting is very bad in the waist area. It kind of hangs there and has not shape at all. I I wear size medium and ordered one but id not like the way it is very loose at  the waist. Returned.
"Bought this for bachelorette party for everyone... does not fit anyone of us. Way too big. Literally spins on my head when I move. Doesn't even come close to fitting...... for a man I guess this would work... for a woman, not even close."
"!!!FALSE ADVERTISING!!! I already own 32 Degrees Shirts (3 of them), and this is NOT A 32 Degree shirt!!!
This is simply a thin somewhat stretchy cotton T-shirt. Again, this is a knock off, There is No brand logo, and the
shirt is labeled 100% cotton, and fits slightly larger than the correct shirts do.
The 32Deg shirt is 87%Polyester and 13% Spandex. I will be returning it."
"I don't care for this shaper.  It is not particularly high-waisted... it comes to just 2 inches above my belly button and it rolls down almost immediately. It is slick feeling, as others have stated, but pant legs still cling to it.  Also, there's a seam up the inside of the legs and you need to be careful to keep it positioned correctly.  It's a thick fabric that gets hot during wear.  It is made well, though, and the thick fabric won't snag or run easily.  For comparison, I am 5'3"", 135lbs, size 6 pants, and I ordered S/M and it fits well in the legs and butt, but does nothing for muffin top."
"I ordered these for a kindergarten project. They were OK.  They were smaller than expected, but that was probably my fault for not reading the description closer. However, the quality wasn't great. Some handles were falling off, some bags were pulled, and some handles had threads hanging off. The kids started pulling them and the handles would start unraveling. Luckily I bought extras."
"Love the color hate the shoe. Runs small, I am a 7.5M. No cushioning or arch support.
Had to return."
"The shoe would be very comfortable if the sizing was correct.  I ordered my regular shoe size 6.  I have small feet and these shoes were very narrow.  In order for me to wear these, I will have to order a whole size up and even then, I am not sure the width will be good."
"its just too large, as in too much fabric that doesn't just flow nicely, just looks too large. And the sides come down too long. too bad, if the fit was more snug it would be a nice blouse. but as it is now i don't like it"
I'm so pissed off!! I bought this dress and brought it 4 hours from home for a special function!! The whole bottom lace is falling off. This is ridiculous!!!
Ripped first time I tried to unbutton
"whatever size you wear, add one size larger. i have a size 12 shoe and ordered a size 12. these were too small. felt and looked like a well made swim shoe but anything made in China is way too small. Good luck."
These things are SHARP! Be careful when trying to put them in.
Fit good..but the fabric too cheap for the price
"~3 inches too small in the waist, and that's no joke. I bought this 1 inch bigger than my jeans so I could tuck my shirt in, but it's so tight that I could barely even get it buttoned. I'm not a big person, either. The pockets feel like stiff canvas, which is very odd.

The length was good, though."
"Bought these Jan 6, 2018. Started wearing them towards the end of Jan. Its now April 10 and one boot has a hole in it! For this price I expected them to last more than a few months. Really disappointed.

My last rain boots lasted TEN YEARS and were only $22."
returned this- fabric is very thin
Not much to review.. It is a shirt
"A little too much bling, but I am sure there will be the occassion I will need them."
I own a few Columbia jackets so I was disappointed when I purchased this jacket for a vacation to New Zealand to find out on the flight over that there was a 2 inch hole in the seam near the right hand pocket. It looks like the person stitching the jacket hadn't joined the two edges together when they stitched them together and left a gap. What surprises me the most is that it got through quality control without anyone noticing the hole.
Shoe Runs Large.  Returned.
"My boyfriend disliked the ""snug opening"" and had trouble getting his privates out."
These dresses are extremely thin and see through. You really could not wear them out of your house. I wear them to lounge in the house. the material does not hold up after washing. There are many holes where the seams have come apart. Not well made.
If you are a Plus size DON'T buy!!! I was excited until I opened my box. Nothing like the picture at all. And I ordered a size up!!! Sending it back soon as the other dress comes.
"Looks nice and fits but inserts came out after three days, sole is decaying at an accelerated rate.  Buy another product."
I ordered my regular size which is 6 and my foot barely fit into the boot. Too narrow and small all around. Boots were pretty but not well built.
Not plated 100 % with gold.
Back light is very dim. Sending it back. Terrible for seniors!
"Good quality fabric, just waaaay to small. I ordered a size 7/8 and they are smaller than her size 6 undies."
The boot is very heavy and is not comfortable to walk with as it constantly slipping in the back heal.
My ex-wife ended up sending the shoes back. They did not fit well
Cute but mildew smell was so strong the packaging had to be disposed of outside and the bracelet is unwearable unless I can get rid of the super strong  odor. Disappointing.
"should be listed as KIDS hat, not for adults.  or adults with xs/s heads"
Tried cleaning my adidas gazelles with them and it stained them even more
Way too small. Had to return. I'm a size 18.
"I'll start with the pros:  It's pretty, simple, the time is easy to read -- especially in the dark when you push in the side pin and it lights up the face.  I find the date difficult to read, though the box size seems to be better than what I've had before in other watches.  So if that were the only things about this watch, I'd give it a 5.  However, I bought this watch in July and a mere 4 months later the watchband is shredded (it may be leather but it's very cheap, poor quality leather and the black coloring on the leather has worn off at the hole.  And a week or so after that, the hour hand has gone wonky.  It's 1/2 hour behind where it should be on the face. So when it looks like it says 11:30, it's really 12:30 - and there's no way to change that.  So now, 4 months after buying, I have to send the watch back to Timex for repair.  What a hassle."
"Rises up from the bottom causing ""bunching"" at the belt line causing discomfort. Another disappointment."
"Loved these shoes and the material is very soft. The bad thing is that one shoe was bigger than the other. Unfortunately, I returned them."
customer returned
"horrible.  this is so narrow that I cannot fit it over my 36D chest.  It barely covers my bottom, so there's no way it could be a dress on me and I'm only 5'5.  I normally wear a size 10 at the most and the size large was incredibly small.  Fit like a size 4-6."
"I usually wear a XL-2X in skirts, so I ordered up a size (3X). The skirt fit just fine. However, it looks really boxy and the liner is much shorter than the skirt. I'm 5 5 and the skirt was knee-length, but the liner only hit mid-thigh and the length of the liner isn't even all the way around. The skirt is very sheer, so it was very obvious the liner wasn't even and it just looked really odd. I'll be sending this skirt back."
"The ""fabric"" upper is plastic underneath.  The photo looks like comfy elastic, but they were not.  Too narrow and have to send them back and probably pay for the return shipping."
The fit wasn't what I expected.
"This jacket is thin and itchy.
I wish it held its shape.
The collar is thick but the body is thin.
It looks saggy on. lol
I paid $29
Its not worth it."
"The zipper is too pointy for a 3 month old baby! It stickes to the neck
Nice design though"
Bought in December for my daughter (freshman in high school) and the straps have already come undone. Average use and didn't last longer than 3 months.
"If i could give this shirt zero stars, i would. Shirt looked nothing like the picture, its NOT off the shoulder and it did not have the elastic band on the side. It was just an overly expensive t-shirt Very disappointing, i will never purchase from this seller again."
With some tailoring it would be cute but it fits like a hot pink hefty bag
I ordered the wide and was very excited to receive such a versatile shoe.  Imagine my disappointment when the shoes were just way too tight through the toe box.  I will be returning these shoes.
This is the ugliest thing in the world. I feel like I could be a pirate. It just doesn't look anything like in the picture. Very disappointed.
the bracelets arrived smelling of mold. I ended up throwing them away.
Yes this item runs extremly small but that is the least of its problems. It rolls down constantly and the but is not too flattering. You could see the cushion when you wear tight clothes with it. Also since they are inserts and not actually sewed on to the boostier I feel they are in a different place every time you move. Not happy :( was really looking forward to this product very disappointed
Sent back.  The backside of the dress was upside down.
"My little one wears 2t-3t underwear, so I ordered these. They were way too tight."
This item is extremely small. I got an XL and I couldn't even try it on. I wear a medium.
This dress is not cut well so it was not a good fit.
"Waited too long to return but I *hate* these sandals. If I tighten the strap to stay on, the toe area is far longer than my toes! Walk right out of them.

I have several Columbia Toe Ring shoes in various styles, too many to count, but I'm hugely disappointed in these."
"These are nice, but waaaay too small. I'm normally a comfortable size 8. I would need a size 12 in these as they are made. Returned."
"the design does not fit my face , so that would make that puechase my fault but i will try again"
These just don't fit my feet correctly. It's the right size but just doesn't feel like my other Salomons. I would not purchase this style again.
decisely too large
"I miss the old daily boost bras, I ordered this and hated it! Straps are just like in the picture, too far over, doesnt fit well at all, bunches at sides"
After 3 wearing the loops that hold the straps in place were completely shredded. Not going to buy this again. Poorly made. But it was very comfortable when I first got it. Too bad
Huge and cheap!
The material is a bit thin and I wish the shirt were longer. I guess I can't expect much for the price.
"I love the feel of the fabric and the nice bright, white color.  However, this bra is way, way too small for my large bosom.  When I wear this nursing bra to sleep, my bosom falls right out of this bra like I'm wearing nothing at all, rendering it useless.  I can't even wear it around the house in the daytime much, because the bosom pops or slips out.  The support is pretty good, but the cup sizes are too small for the D-cup range."
Slightly itchy thing fabric. Not worth more than $10.
"Same comment as for the Ultimate Roc II pants, bought one size larger than I need given they measure differently where ever these are made."
Too baggy for my taste.
"Did not like th fabric and runs small, maybe because it is not leather which would give some."
"Fabric quality is good.  This pullover also is warm and feels good.  However, I found it hanging way below the waist line and sleeves also are a bit too long.  I would have preferred a pullover that would fit around my waistline.  Overall I am OK with it."
"I love the colars and all and the fit is good, its just i was kinda disappointed by the fabric its very thin..I didn't appreciate that, and i bought the exact same ones at WAlmart.. Thats sad."
feels like your walking flat footed
"I received my Slim Wallet by SERMAN BRANDS last week. As soon as I opened it, it stinks like chemicals, not like any leather Ive ever smelled before. I had to put it out on the porch it was so bad. It comes in a nice presentation box good to give as a gift. I ordered the cherry color; it is a real dark, dark cherry. The wallet itself comes with 2 credit card slots on one side and center pocket for cash. It says it has RFID technology to keep you and your credit information safe from theft. Of course you can use this for business cards, cash and your identifications. It can be used in your front or back pocket. I ordered this primarily for my son but he has asthma and with the smell of this he will never be able to use it. I decided to give it to a friend that helps me with doing odds and ends around my home. I would not repurchase.
Disclaimer: I have received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest unbiased review. My opinions are my own and they are given after I personally have experienced the product."
"This shirt is truely black, not faded.  And the logo is spot on too.  It came in in a reasonable amount of time and the price didn't bother me.  The only issue is that it's probably about a half a size smaller than it should be.  I wear an XXL and it's a little tight.  Not so much that I can't wear it, but if I lost about 15 pounds, it'd be perfect.  Other than that, I like it."
Too ugly.  I sent them back.
"Cheap stockings, came with runs already in them. Love the attached garter though, keeps them up without hassle."
"This is a good watch and is easy to set. I love the look of it and the band is solid so no need to worry about it falling off when roughing it up. The display however, can only be from viewed directly above. If you view the watch face from any other angle, it will read all 8s which is frustrating. Also the pressure from rubbing the sleeve of my uniform cuff is enough to hit the Mode button which can lead to resetting the date and time or just some annoying beeps in my experience. The instruction manual that came with the watch didn't match the watch I received."
"I really liked this bra, but for some reason it felt like it was going to slip up all the time. I think it was just too big. was returned."
"Not large enough, needed larger size but was not avaible"
"You get what you pay for.  It is strong, but I wouldn't put any expensive pendants or anything I couldn't live without, on it."
Look strange on
looks nice but clips could be stronger
When they said big boys - did not know it was for early teens. Had to return it but Amazon happily took it back and we got another product.
The material is the worst in all toms shoes I have. Really disappointed.
The quality was excellent but the size ran very big. Order one size smaller.
"The boot itself is cute, well made, waterproof, and sturdy. However, it hits at just below the part where my calves taper and it's really unflattering and kinda diesel-looking, frankly. And while there's nothing wrong with looking diesel, it's not my particular thing. Motorcycle boots have enough toughness on their own and I returned these because I'd prefer a more flattering/slightly more feminine looking boot that still has some edge."
Im a 32 or 33 usually but for these pants im a 30 exactly
"Didn't fit, see through, poor quality"
doesn't lay right on a curvy person
I returned this shoe because they didn't fit right for me.  My heel came to the right spot but my toes felt cramped.
Very narrow and insole is not removable so my orthotics won't even slide into the shoes. Have 2 other pair of Patagonia that I love. Will try to find some similar to what I have.
"Ok, fabric is thin but some may want that."
"Toe is right at the top
Not as tall as appearance"
they shrink to much
I wish this top was as long as pictured. It is shorter than I would like. The material and construction is quite nice and I would give this 5 stars if it was longer!
Nice but needed to decrease 1/2 size.  Should offer free return shipping knowing these sandals run small.
"It fits. It was ok, not very sexy, but practical"
They are no longer elastic......beats me! Comfortable at first but after two dozen wears they've lost their mojo.
"The shirt looked awesome, but it ran small. I wear an xl and the shirt fit like a medium. I didn't return it because I am losing weight and hope to fit into it soon. It it's really cool looking though!"
The regular medium is too short and the tall I have bought elsewhere is too long
They did not hold my 8yr olds glasses snug on his face. The hang around the neck. However it is a nice strap if you are just looking to hold the around your neck.  Going to give to my friend how's 10 yr old has locks.  They will probably be snug on his head.
"Have this watch in several other colors.  The size is absolutely perfect for a ladies wrist, but quite sporty and an easy to read dial.  This color combination (pink/brown) is unusual and classy at the same time.  Unfortunately, it arrived with the protective plastic missing from the band and the tag cut off.  I think it may have been worn before returning.  I did contact Amazon requesting a full refund, which was a speedy process. The watch itself is super nice and a great price through Amazon, if you are willing to take a chance for whats in the box."
"These are nice, but they are not book ended.  They are two earrings identical so they don't really hang as well as I would like.  Will be more careful to look at that before ordering earrings again."
Not as comfortable as I expected.  :(
Love them but are very very small.  Barely fit my one year old.
Pants are more like 12 month size( I bought 18month size) just a little wider in the waist and they're actually a little shorter in length then some of my 12 month pants that I have for my son.  They work for now but not when hes going to be actually fitting in the 18 month size clothes.
Keeping but it does run small in the chest and in the arms.
Feel a little squished.  Went up asize on the next order and it was perfect.  Very comfortable.
"i loved the style of these Crocs. Unfortunately, they gave him blisters so he has to wear socks or footies with these."
"I usually order a large, these run larger. The material is really thin, they are perfect for lounging or exercise."
"This is a so called ""plus size"" blouse.  I would want designers to know that many plus size women have breasts.  This blouse is beautiful and the pleating in the back is gorgeous but it doesn't fit in the chest and it's designed for smaller breasted women.  I will never  understand clothes made that are supposed to be large and designers don't give room for larger waists and chests.  Even if I lose more weight my boobs won't flatten out to fit this blouse properly.  I will gift this item to a friend."
"not nearly as 3D as it appears in photo, just a flat scull, is not accented with the shiny look on photo"
Product in the straps kinda weak broke them as soon as I unpackaged the package *sad face* material seems warm though
These are hard to keep on.  They gape open on the sides and I walk out of them.
"It ran a bit small,  but worked."
"In terms of style and comfort this shoe meets all the criteria, unfortunately I feel it's a bit on the heavy side for an active runner as myself,  size does run smaller as well so keep that in mind, order a size up.  But overall a good shoe for your daily routine use."
"Because the rubber sole is thick and heavier than most flip-flops when you walk they make a loud slapping noise on your heel when they come back on your foot when waking,  It bothers me so I am going to ask to send back."
Not a firm fit so had to return
"Fits good but really puffy. Im 5'7"" 145lbs. Does look cute though."
"Shoes look nice, but they are so ""hard"" and don't expect them to go any wider... nothing helped and as of right now I never got the chance to wear them..."
"I purchased these cause my favorite color is yellow and i love boat shoes.  Upon trying them on I noticed a bit of extra room and in addition, , wearing socks with these is goignt o be difficult.  They are not too comfy to walk in either but because they are a nice bright citrus yellow they will get a thumbs up."
Love the white dress but too big. I ordered two in a medium a black one and white one. For some reason the white one fits like a large.
"Great because they're cheap. The Velcro bet part doesn't tighten or adjust at all, it's decorative (and when the Velcro fills with snow it stops holding so the strap just flaps around) and on day#2 one of the elastic at the top popped right off. But you know what? They keep my kid's feet warm and reasonably dry."
Cut oddly across the top of the thighs and stomach. Good if you have thin legs and a pouchy tummy.
"I bought a size 18/20 in the black and white stripes. I'm 5'9, about 210 pounds, the dress goes all the way to the ground! The elastic part on the top is a little bit tight, I have a pretty small chest for a plus size woman so for a size 18/20 it really shouldn't be tight. Pretty dress and it fits me relatively good. It has 3 stars because I don't think most 18/20 sized women would fit well in this dress."
"For size 12 D the shoes are very snug on my feet. I preferred more room but I'll just keep them and wear them occasionally, but there's no chance of me  reordering these shoes."
Love the color buto for a baby who wear a size 6 and the size didn't fit they must run a little small
"the material of the bag is a little light, but is put together well"
Runs small
Better quality than the Brawler pants but still a little pricey.  Likely would not buy again unless the price drops around  $10.
the bodice seemed alittle crooked.
I didn't like the faded look it has and there was was a snag on the material that stood out so I returned it with no hassle just had to pay the shipping label. I chose another dress from this seller because they have so many options.
"Ive been a Dansko die-hard for over 15 years. Im a size 41 across the board but since theyve been outsourcing their production to China, the fit is inconsistent. I sometimes have to order 41W or have even gone up to 42. Disappointed in this particular pair as the left shoe fits fine but the right shoe is painfully tight across the top of my foot. I will try to stretch the shoe. The length is good (my standard size 41) but the width feels very narrow. Nice color though."
"It is attractive and seems strong.  I was disappointed in the packaging.  It was in a plastic baggie inside a nice jewelry box.  However, despite guides available in the box it was twisted and tangled.  I spent about 20+ minutes getting it straight, and I think I damaged 2 links trying to get in untangled."
This dress hit me almost two inches above the knees and I am 5:9 so it would be better for a shorter person
"This ring looks beautiful on....for awhile. I have been wearing it now for 5 months. I am holding out for a ring of my dreams, until then, this will do. However........the prongs move around alot, one of them has broken off and the color and brilliance of the metal has faded alot. At least none of the stones have fallen out and it still fools people."
The colors ate WAY off. More a yellow-orange than orange. The wings will need to be adjusted for my 7yr old. The tail can be pinned but needs to be stuffed. He is excited and is willing to wear it.
Kept them because they are blue.  Not great quality or fit.
"Not very good quality, thought material would have been better, graphic faded after one wash, i wouldnt buy again, but cool designs."
"I ordered a whole size larger than my usual size 5.  Even then, for a person with a high instep like me, these slippers are really tight across the instep.  I wasn't convinced that they would ever feel comfortable, even after the lining packed down some.  The rest of the slipper felt fine.  Just be aware that this style comes up high and may not work for those with high insteps."
This belt is confusing and loosens up to easily.
cute shoe and appeared very comfortable but too large. The biggest part was the strap across the front was huge.
Good replacement laces for hiking boots
"It is beautiful i like it, but it's not free size. It's large, also the material is not that good, doesn't have the good price for this material."
"It's too big in the armpit area/side bust. I am a 32 DD, so I can fill it out but there is still extra space in the arm... I love the style though so I will be taking it in with my sewing machine..."
"I have an older version of these that I was looking to replace, but these are not the same item and run larger. I will have to exchange for a smaller size. The thickness had increased as well."
Yes my son has a big head for his age but he's two and this says its for 6+. It works for a picture but I won't fit most kids over 3.
returned only because I didn't end up loving the longer side otherwise dress was perfect.
This dress is cute. It's cheap or-inexpensive but cute I kind of worried about putting in the washer  I think I'll wash it by hand inside out.
"I gave this shirt three stars rather than 4 or 5 because it ran a little bit small. My son's uniform polo shirts are extra large and he has extra room in them, but tohis one was a little snug. It's a nice quality good looking shirt"
Does what it should. Practical. Lightweight. The shoe compartment is what sold it for me... I cannot think of putting shoes in the same area of clothing!!!
"I was disappointed in the quality of the product. It was not real leather and was not distressed as described, they are shiny and hard."
These run three sizes too small.  Made for Hobbits
"My wife has very long legs, she's 5'9"".  These barely made it up her thighs. She kept worrying all night that her skirt was too short because the stocking tops would show."
I have worn Dearfoams for years and this is the first time they have ever seemed small and I got the same size I always do.  Maybe next time.  Am giving them to friend.
"These were great while they lasted.  As others have said, they do eventually split open up the back.  I tried fixing with duct tape, but to no avail.  So, enjoy these while they last.  For me, they lasted for two years, and I'm OK with that.  The bottom cushion also came loose, moved around, and bunched up over time.  I threw it out.  I continued to wear them without the insert and I had no problems (but I don't have picky feet)."
its a work shirt
Would like to have kept but it was about 2 sizes larger than reported.
So far quite satisfied however water leaves stain marks !!
Fit is WAY too small.
This product ships directly from China.  It has a chemical smell to it. Which is too bad because they are cute and inexpensive.
"I should  have ordered medium.  However I liked it enough to give them to my sister.  ""Love's Them""."
The only complaint I have is that this is advertised as a drawstring closure.  The string is just sewn on in the front it does not go around the waist and thus does nothing to cinch the waistline tighter.  So once the elastic starts to give the pants are done.  If not for that I would've given this product 5 stars since I prefer an adjustable fit around my waist especially after the pants have been worn a little.
"These are beautiful hoops, but the coating turns my earring hole green. I can only wear them for a few hours at a time before they start to turn green and start bugging me. Not real gold coating in any way, and equivalent to what you would find at low end department stores. Good for the price, just don't like how sensitive my ears become with them on."
If I had purchased half a size smaller these shoes would have been perfect.
"Great looking, funky/hip leather wedge. BUT, so uncomfortable.. I found the ankle strap a tad short, the shoe somewhat narrow for a medium width and no arch  support. This wedge was hard to walk on out of the box. Sending back...5 stars for looks and 1 star for fit. So a three is just about right as an overall score. There may be someone out there that has better luck with the fit of this wedge. If you have flat feet, and trouble with high heels in general, avoid this shoe."
They are comfortable on my high arches. I stand all day at work and they comfortable. The cons are they tend to make my back hurt and they track in dirt.
They are very small.
"Wish it stayed up a bit better. Fell down (not all the way off, but came down) quite a few times throughout the day. Works good with a tight fitting top. I have a C cup and still struggled a bit with keeping it up."
"Looked like the product picture. Extremely cheap and thin plastic, probably would only hold up a few wears. If this was under $6 I might give it a 5 stars. For this price I expected the plastic to be a bit more sturdy."
"I like it fits well, sexy to some degree an the quality is not bad at all."
This WAS my favorite dress!  I loved everything about it until I wore it to a sweaty jazz club. The fabric does not breathe and the dye ran TERRIBLY!  I can no longer wear it and it was such a favorite of mine.
I wore and loved the UA speed foam shoes previous to this pair. I'm disappointed as these lack the form fitting comfort and cushion my first ones had.
"Love the idea behind it, but first time using when it was raining and a little windy, it bent some of the wiring. Maybe needs to be a little tougher."
"Nice, but to small for my arms. I thought an adult could use it :("
Material was totally falling all over the place. Runs too large
Based on reviews I bought a size smaller than I normally wear and it still fits a little big. I kept it because the print is adorable and it is really comfortable to wear. To overcome it being slightly big/boxy I just wear it with a skinny belt!
"I purchased this cloak for a theatrical production for my school. I like it, but it arrived with the button at the neck so loose that our costumer will have to repair it before our play. Other than that, I think the quality is okay."
"Okay, run large."
I had to return this because it had a stitching error on the inside.
Nice flip flop if you can stand the bumps inside. I couldn't so I sent it back :(  Runs a little large too.  Good service and package was clean and new.
Too small. I'll go one size up next time. They do cut the wind as advertised though.
"I ordered a 7 in these because I had to order a 7 in the Floe style.  These are way to tight on the top of the foot and way too small.  They are heavier than the Floe style as well, which is not a deal breaker, but I think I'll keep the Floe style and send these back."
Really comfortable but a little sloppy looking. They're fine around the house.
The top fit pretty comparable to other brands. However the pants were too short and very bunchy.
"This shirt runs large.  I'm usually a 1X, which is what I ordered but it definitely feels like a 2X."
"The dress looked nice overall, but i ordered plum it was more of a reddish/mauve color. didn't match the other bridesmaid's so i had to return.

Also: some people have commented saying the shoulder straps are way tight, but that is because they are supposed to fit off-the-shoulder. knowing this, they fit fine"
"Super tight fitting. Maybe they're supposed to be that way, but it's definitely a pain pulling baby's arms through."
"While attractive, the watch is huge, and is sized more like those ""urban"" watches. I am nearly 200 pounds and 6'3""."
Perhaps this was mismarked......  I always wear a large but the coat was way too big.  It was an X large or more.  Attractive coat though and I could feel the warmth immediately when trying on.  Had to send back due to the size issue.
"I was so excited about a petite jacket with stretch in gray. The length is okay, but arms are way too long! And, because of the cute button detail, hemming the sleeves is going to be a problem. I'm going to keep it, but I'm really disappointed"
Left show fit perfectly but right show was wide & not as comfortable
"I normally wear ""M"" or ""D"" width shoes,  but I guess in sandals, you need to go wider.  Or the makers need to make the sandals wider.  They're nice sandals, just a bit on the narrow side; my big toe on both feet tends to hang over the side a bit.  I'll keep them because they are pretty comfortable, but I won't get the same ones again."
Runs a little small but still not bad
"Shirt is nice to the first few times you wear it, but once its been through the wash a few times, it starts to pill and the material is very thin. But the length and angled hem are great!"
"This hat is attractive, but it is thin and not very warm.  It's attractive as a fashion accessory but not useful in really cold weather."
Dress is nice but its very small in waist so it doesn't fit properly.
the shirt
"These are okay, would be better if they didn't cut through the middle of each cheek. I think they just run a little small."
"Love the strap, nice thick leather that matches my Fossil watch perfectly however, I have large wrists and the strap is pretty short and its very tight on my wrist, so tight I can't use it. If you have average to small wrists it's perfect."
"Did not understand ""shelf bra"" meant a thin layer of fabric."
this is a pretty robe but I feel it is shorter than the photo would suggest and I am only 5'
Needs more support even with making the bow extra tight just does not give much support
My daughter loves this and won't let me put it away with the luggage even!  It is cute and vibrant.  My only issue with this and why it got three stars is that it is very easily scratched and marked so we have to be very careful with it.  Great for going to Grandmas in the car but don't think it would survive much heavier travel than that...
"very, very small/real tight fit on 7 yr olds ears. and no purple."
"Got these for my husband for workout shoes. They were replacing his Nike Free Runs. They are little heavier than he expected because the sneakers he's used to are really light. However, they are soft and have good cushion and fit well. He is happy with the sneakers overall."
I have been wearing this particular shoe for years so I can't figure out why this pair was tight.  I think it might have been mismarked.
"I haven't worn it yet. But love the colors. I keep forgetting I
have it actually.... Thanks for the push..."
"There were no pockets in bag more like a shopping bag, also I went to Ross department store
locally and found the same make, colour and better styles for ten dollars cheaper.
I did not like paying 8 dollars for shipping either.  I ended up giving item away."
Fits good and quality is good but even for walking in March and April (15 degree of Celsius) it's very hot for feet. It's my first pair of Nike and expected more than I get
look very nice on my baby.
The same style in the button Vee necks are way more comfortable. The somewhat small size makes these sort of uncomfortable around the neck
not for people with leg muscles. The boot fits but the cuff is really tight on my calf.
I have older hanes beefy tee shirts that are roomy.  The new ones are  little smaller.  They are acceptable but rather they were a little roomier.  Material and construction are good.
"I purchased this jacket in black, size M.  It fits beautifully and looks very stylish.  A very nice jacket and I love it. So, I decided to buy the same jacket in blue, same size.  When it arrived I immediately tried it on.  I could not believe that the fit was too tight.  I could zip it up but there was no room for movement.  Now I ask, how can there be such a discrepancy in sizing between COLORS.  I had to return the jacket.  I would have reordered the blue jacket in a large, but I would not have been able to receive the special pricing deal that was offered originally.  Very disappointed."
"These boots were super cute and looked well made (didn't look cheap). They fit well on my actual foot but I could only zip them up half way. In other people's reviews they wrote that they could squeaze in to them but that was not an option for me. I have muscular calves but didn't think they were bigger than normal considering that I'm a small person. Very disappointed, ended up giving them to a friend who is super tiny, fit her just fine."
Feel like some cheap thin material.
I don't like the buckle mechanism.  Got stuck several times.
they feel vary thin
Returned Item and disappointed on my refund
"I bought these as a gift and I have to say that they seemed perfect. However, after only two weeks the polarized lens appears to be pealing :/ they've been kept in the case when not being worn."
"Too big, there is no way to wear. And the actual size does not match."
"So, these are definitely not ""no-show"", but they are comfortable and grippy, The heel does not slip. While I won't be wearing these with my ballet flats, I will definitely wear them with slip on tennis shoes. They are also kind of nice to wear around the house - the bottom is non-slip."
"This watch case opener is OK for certain watches that have the particular snap back case backs that have a slot that the opener will fit. This watch case opener will not accommodate all watches with snap back case backs. I have several type of watch case back openers, which is a good idea for those who are watchmakers such as myself."
"These are poor build quality with overspray of the black paint on the front of the strap. They look okay and fit okay, but when I walked two miles in them, there were sores on my feet. I don't get those from most flip flops. They may be better when they've been worm more."
"good quality, but narrow, have to fold your dollars in order to fit them into this wallet"
If u want a dress for around the house then this is what you'll get. In my opinion the picture is miss leading. It did come pretty quick but not what i expected as far as material. I will be returning mines.
Its good but not as soft as expected..
a little uncomfortable but for the price you really cant go wrong.  Tags are kinda itchy underwire a little stiff and jabs a little but color and style very nice looking
"This wallet lasted about 3 or 4 months, then the inside liner separated from the rest of the wallet somehow. Also, most of the credit card slots are too small. The magnetic fastener is coming out of the flap, and I have to be really careful with it, or it will be gone forever. It's not bad for the price, but I will be replacing it within a year of my purchase because the quality is not such that it will hold up to regular wear for a long period of time. I do like the owl design. It's cute."
Warm and comfy. Some of the seams came apart when washed but were easily repaired.
"It is of good quality and it's an okay vest but I was disappointed the way the shoulder pads don't lay flat against the shoulders at the edge.  They ride up on my shoulders, why I don't know and it may just me being too critical !"
Very sexy shoes but a little high
"They are nice socks, for that I would recommend them.
What I was looking for was a diabetic sock, with compression in the ankle area.
The don't seen to have the amount of compression they require and loosen up."
Great gloves to keep your hands warm but don't expect to use them with a handgun like a Glock.  Fine with AR15.
"and soft and comfy, ty"
"Nice, packable and lightweight for the money"
"Love the fabric, the colors, the style, but they're too narrow.  I find Skechers to be really inconsistent with their sizing and must really be tried on in the store.  I ordered my usual 7.5 M but they were too narrow on one foot, okay on the other, length was fine.  I returned."
Bottom of the skirt looks undone I was confused otherwise nice easy wear thanks
"The kimono style wrap itself is gorgeous! Good quality sewing and stitching, beautiful bright colors. But it is cut VERY small. It is not a loose, long and flowy wrap. It is cut to be worn like an open fronted suit jacket. And in all honesty, while I purchased this for it's loose, flowing coverage I still really like it. When worn with a tank or camisole parked with a pair of tailored dress pants/capris it looks fantastic. I went to a professional training seminar in it."
"The necklace was very short- and the pic of the Cross showed a Black background- which the Cross I received did not have a Black background- but was Silver on both layers. However, I do like it."
Way to large for my personal needs.  Good quality
Ok fit.  Needs to be longer.  Nice fabric; feels good on the skin.  Not muuch fading after multiple washes.
A little to shiny
"I ordered a small size but it was still too large, I am still thinking what to do about it."
"Well I really want to like them, this is my first pair of clogs.  I do not find myself to have wide feet but when I wear these they rub the outside of my toes (sides) , Haven't given me blisters but definitely rubs on them till they are sore in those areas.  I have only worn them for a week now and I am wondering if I should of just bought the Danskos instead.  The price was unbeatable, but  yeah kind of wish I would of went with a slightly larger clog.  I worked 14 hours one night in these, and my legs didn't ache like normally so that is amazing!!! Just sore toes."
charming but broke at the seam on the first day
"These are cute but they don't last. My older kiddo wore them for one not-very-rainy season (certainly not every day!) and they had already started cracking. When my little one got them as a hand-me-down, they lasted just a few wears before they had cracks throughout, especially where the boot bends while walking."
"It works well, but the ribbing bends too easily after a couple of wears."
"I liked the shirt very much, but it did not fit across the bust. It was too tight. I ordered the medium, but a large would have been too big everywhere else. I am a 34D if that helps."
"These are great for about an hour, then they begin to roll down."
"I ordered a C/D width which is my normal size, but these seem a little snug right out of the box.  Maybe, they will get better with some breaking in.  They are a nice looking shoe."
Smaller than what it is made to look on the page but overall the color is great and it is nice quality
these also run a little large and have a tendency to stretch out after a few hours.  I'm going to wash them in hot water and dry them in a hot dryer to see if I can shrink them a little.  but they are comfortable.  nice soft denim.
"It's not very well constructed, but it does serve the purpose I got it for - taking pictures to frame items. Not the best, but you could do worse."
I gave this shoe 3 stars not because this pair was good but because I have 3 pair of this shoe that are wonderful.  Could not wear this shoe more than 5 minutes as my foot was hurting.  I returned this shoe.  Makes we wonder if these were the real thing.  I bought the same shoe somewhere else and it was comfortable from the minute I put them on.
"I give up on slippers; despite the ads, I find that there is too little support in the sole of any slippers, these included"
I use these as my everyday earrings. Comfortable and fun.
Seems to shrink when I wash it so now it's to short as I usually like to get longs when they are available
I purchased these for $67.  I was thrilled with the great price.  I read reviews & ordered 1/2 size up.  They fit but I will be returning.  The boots are not substantial like other Timberlands that I own.  The sole is thin with little padding in the footbed.  I'm very disappointed in the quality of these boots.  Timberland's quality is slipping.
this slipper is soft and comfortable and fits well. but it's a lot heavier and the sole is stiffer than i hoped. i hoped for something like crock kind of sole with a soft top. but it's more like a dress shoe kind of sole.
"I so much wanted these to work. They are cute and comfy. I usually wear a 9, so I ordered a half size down. I have one other pair of Keens which are a 8.5, so I thought this would be normal, and also based on other reviews-- it seemed good to go down. The width is perfect. I can tell they are a lovely shoe. As I walked around the house with them on my toes touched the end of the shoe. So while they seemed really good in every other way-- I just know that it will bother me to have toes touching the end. I can tell though, that the next size up would be too big. So while I really wanted them to work for me.... I can see that they won't. Sad day."
This is your typical party store halloween costume for kids.  Mask is rubber and the costume is fabric.  I don't expect much out of it and hope he is able to wear it to school and trick or treat without messing it up too badly.  Any fall or knee slide will tear this thing immediately.  Not meant to be worn more than a couple times.  I would not buy this as a play outfit for your kid.
"Loved it when I initially received it. So pretty but a few weeks into wearing it, it has started staining my skin. I've purchased several charms through Amazon and this is the first time I've had this happen"
You get what you pay for.. I just probably won't pay for these again.
"I am a true size 6 in sneakers, 5.5-6 in shoes. After reading the reviews I decided to go half a size down because most agreed they run large. The 5.5 was surprisingly big. There was about 2 inches worth of space in the toe bed. I'm exchanging for a size 5, which I suspect will fit.

Also, by no means are my feet wide but they did feel a little more snug than usual around the top part of my foot, but not uncomfortable. Maybe they just need a little breaking in, even though they are canvas. Let's see how the 5 fits..."
"Nice thick material... Wasnt sure what to expect. .. I'm 5'4"" and normally wear between size 12 and 14 bottoms, so based on reviews, i ordered a 2XL... Big mistake - it was way too big. I pulled on d skirt and it was just loose... I live overseas, so doesn't make sense for me to return it. I only realised after taking off d skirt and turning it inside out (to see how and if i could take it in) that it has a hidden zipper. .. Based on that, the material and the style of skirt i should have ordered a large for a proper fit."
returned as didn't like the way they fit.
I love the Dawgs but this pair are not the same size even though it says they are. One feels like someone stretched it to the next size up and the other fits snug and it is like I don't even have shoes on. The bigger shoe makes a sucky noise when I walk. I love the color. I have other styles of this shoe and have been very happy.
one size fits all I wear size 7 and they were too small
"These boots are adorable and I was surprised at how sturdy the sole is.  However, they felt very wide and huge on me, even though I had ordered my usual size.  I was looking for something to wear on rainy days while in Europe this spring, and realized these weren't it, just fit my size 10, wide feet much too loosely. This was my first time purchasing rain boots so I have no comparison.  I could imagine that they'd be good for being out in the mud mucking out the barns or taking your dog for a walk, just not the right boot for my purpose."
"Beautiful watch, the size is perfect, easy to note the time at a glance and the stopwatch feature (which I use constantly) is also easily viewed.  The reason I gave it only three stars is the size of the date window.  This is a large faced watch (45 mm) and all functions are easy to see at a glance, except for the date window.  The date window is totally out of proportion with the rest of the watch and nearly unreadable.  This makes no sense as there is plenty of room on the watch face for a larger date window.  A fix is needed here.  Otherwise I'm very satisfied."
"Some sock pairs were not identical.  Three of 12 pairs had unequal heel color areas, where one sock looked normal while the second sock heel area was half again larger than the ""normal""sock.  Since the toe and heel areas are either contrasting color, or a color picked from from one of the colored  stripes, the sock with large heel area stands out garishly.  With casual loafer style shoes it is visually distracting.  I kept all of the socks and will wear the mismatched heel socks to wear only with full oxford style shoes.

All of these socks were finished off with rather rough ""stitching"" at the toe.  I had to remove some strange colored thread samples from several socks.  I can't imagine how these thick blue treads ended up in the stitched toes.

All in all, you can not fault the low price of this dozen pair of socks."
Not as comfortable as I expected. They black ones fit smaller than the multi - color ones I purchased. Can only wear them a few hours - disappointed.
These are nice snow boots but I returned them because they were too big.  I will order a half size down next time.
"I got some doubles and triples so they're no carefully picked out but overall, I like a lot of them. Some I wouldn't wear but that's just my own picky taste. They're sturdy and won't break easily."
The part on the top of the foot comes up higher than the teacup crochet version that I love.  In my opinion these are ugly and disappointing compared to the crochet pair that I love
"Very cute boot but a tight fit in the toe area. I was only able to wear them for a short time. I'm hoping after I break them in a little more I'll be able to wear longer.  Also, the heels are very noisy! The padded insole is appreciated!  I really like this style so I'm not ready to give up on them yet."
Sad to say but I order size 10M size 7 is what I got.
Runs smaller then it says
"I did not like this dress. It looks great in the photo, but when I put it on, the neckline came down about halfway between my sternum and my navel, and I felt uncomfortably exposed. I would not have been able to lean over even slightly without flashing someone, and it was so low cut as to look awkward and strange, not sexy or alluring. Seeing as how I was looking for elegant (not sexy or alluring, and certainly not awkward and strange), I returned the dress for a refund. Perhaps on a very busty woman, it might work for picking up men in bars, but this dress absolutely did not meet my standards."
"The glasses look rather big on your face and end up taking up a rather large proportion of your face. For this reason they are not ideal as an accessory. They're also slightly uncomfortable. Other than that, the glasses appear to be good quality and they're not a bad style."
The green is quite dull in person.
"Poor product, very thin and elastic has very littles stretch. What has happened with Hanes??"
Wasn't the legging presented in the picture when it comes to length! They are down to my ankles
The recommendation to order a 1/2 size down was right on for me. Fit in the foot was comfortable. Liked that they were pretty light weight compared to some waterproof knee-high boots. Unfortunately the hard plastic on the front of the boot hit my shin in the most uncomfortable way when walking in these -- which I planned to do a lot of. I will have to return.
"Tons of pockets, durable, and many features.  I'm a short person and these didn't fit so well.  They're also a bit thick and too hot for warm weather."
"Its a very cute bracelet, and thats why i gave three stars. It arrived quickly, but fell apart quickly. It was strung entirely too tight and one of the turtles fins broke off."
Cute pajamas but as many may know Gerber clothes tend to run small!
"Love the fabric. I probably should have ordered a size smaller. They are as advertised - verrrry stretchy. They are also very high waisted - maybe too high waisted...especially since I have to keep pulling them up. I love the length. Ordered grey and black. The grey ones came with a hole/tear in the seam on the leg. Overall, I am happy with the purchase."
"Unfortunately I am returning the one I ordered because I got the wrong size. I ordered larger than I'd normally wear as these types of shirts usually fit too tight on me, but this was not the right move! Suggest ordering your normal size or going up one size. This tank would work well for layering with a snugger top underneath or sleeping in."
"These shoes fit fine, but they are stiff and a little uncomfortable. I hope they'll loosen up with use."
"The design of the purse was exactly what I needed for an event; but I was very disappointed in the quality of work for the purse.  Screws holding parts of the handle kept falling out, I had to glue them in and could tell they were not holding the pieces together.  The size is good; but it will not hold up to much use."
"great quality, very soft, but they sent me the wrong color. Contacted them to have it fixed but I didn't want to pay extra to ship it back to them, so that's that."
I like  underwear hanes it's comforter
"Works as a cover up. Very short. Very see through. I am using it for a resort in the Caribbean. It'll work for there but I don't see this as a casual ""wear to the city pool"" cover up. For as much as you can see through it, might as well go without a cover up."
"Well, I expected small, so ordered a half size down, but because of style and my narrow foot, should of ordered a full size down.  Will probably return unfortunately.  Was ordering for a costume, and still can't hold on my feet. BUT the did arrive so quickly I should have time to get them exchanged, hopefully!"
"Wish they were a little bit bigger,I'm a small person, hurts somewhat on my nose, may get better with time!"
"A little too big for my nephew, but u know the saying, ""too big is a fit"", he will grow into it"
Not all that comfortable maybe after a few washing it  it get better
"I absolutely wear a 35 X 34 Relaxed fit jean.
I have for about a decade.
I used to wear 32's in H/S, 33's in University, 34's during my mid-adult years & finally 35's.
I read the other reviews & unless I'm just now finally at a 36?? & my present Hole-in-the-knee only reason I'm buying a new pair of jeans 35 X 34's are simply stretched out & further relaxed??.
These Jeans do indeed Run a Size too small.
These 35's fit like my 34's....can I wear my 34's?? Yeah, probably....but at my age?? I have no one left to impress & a much bigger wallet (Actually 2 of them now because my Chiropractor suggested it to balance out my huge Castanza Wallet) & I don;t want to jump into my jeans any longer.

I bought a 36 X 34 Just in case with these 35's (Due to the reviews) & the 36's fit like my present Hole-in-the-knee 35's.

So whatever size ""YOU ARE""? Buy the next size up...."
"very pretty, but not sturdy at all, and wobbles when I touch it. Also there aren't very many spots where long dangly earrings can fit without covering other slots"
Not exactly what I expected. I bought for a wedding guest dress. It's not dressy enough to wear. The dress is ok for casual summer dress.
"Costume was a lot of fun for the first 5 minutes, then it got very hot very quickly. This feels just like a fur coat, and will make you sweat at the party you go to. Also one of the arms had a manufacturing defect so you needed to twist the coat to fit your arm through."
"I got these for my husband to wear to bed, and probably should've gone with a larger size (though that's not why I'm only giving them 3 stars.) They didn't feel particularly heavy weight, but for what they cost, they were fine.  Just nothing to write home about."
"I bought this for a ring master halloween costume. I followed the sizing chart and got the 5XL, but it was way too big. For reference, I am 5' 3"", 170lbs, 40"" waist, and typically buy XL shirts. On its tightest lacing, it was still too big for me. I sent it back and went with 3XL so I could have a slight gap in back and still get that hourglass look."
too small and skinny
"One size doesn't work if you are a small person.  The fabric was good quality, not light and flimsy. Would not have returned it if offered in specific sizes."
I'm only giving them 3 stars because I expected to receive something as comfortable as the Bernie Mev or Sketchers with memory foam soles. Not the case.  They are cute and the leather is a good quality.  I will keep them because I've worn them & they'll be cute to wear if I'm going out downtown but NOT to wear to wor and that's why I bought them!
"I would have to say,  just okay. I  think I was more impressed with the photo then the actual product. I bought this for a cruise,  and didn't end up wearing it."
"The cross is just as described and looks like the picture.
-The chains is not silver just like many reviewers pointed out. Only the cross is silver. Chain broke after 3 weeks of wearing it constantly so the quality is not great. It is average (consistent with an average price).
- After 1 month chain lost its color (dark grey). Cross still keeps its color but I am sure like any silver product it will need regular cleaning.
-Chain size is so that one cannot see the cross. It is on the chest line."
A bit too thin for my needs.
"These look like great shoes....for some people?  For some reason, on my feet the rear part of the top (where you see the little loop thing sticking out) is way too far back for me and really worries at my leg.

Had to send them back--a shame, really like the look and felt comfie when not walking!"
"This is a good watch.  Not a great watch, but it works as advertised.

I purchased this watch because the Suunto watch I typically wear (I am in the US Army) on duty was acting up, and I didn't fell like sending it in again for another pressure sensor change.  My requirements for a watch are pretty simple:  it has to be waterproof, and I have to be able to tell the time in the dark. This watch does both things extremely well.

Most watches incorporate some kind of light.....either a light that illuminates a portion of the watch, or a backlight that lights up the entire face.  Other watches use some kind of luminous paint on the hands that absorbs light so it will glow in the dark.  That technique does not work very well.

Luminox uses tiny vials of tritium that glow without having to absorb ambient light.  They will supposedly glow for 25 years.  The hands and number markers on this watch glow well enough to tell the time in complete darkness.

I won't go into the waterproofing for this watch because that feature has been well documented.

The case of this watch is some kind of polymer (plastic) that seems to be very durable.  It is extremely light....you won't even notice the weight of this very large watch.

The chronograph functions work well, but I don't often use it.  It is basically an analog stopwatch.  No complaints, but no real praise for this feature.

One drawback is the crystal is mineral and NOT sapphire, and as such it is not as scratch resistant.  Not a huge deal, but for the price a sapphire crystal should be standard.

I am now editing this review and removing a star from my previous review.

The watch has suddenly started to display the wrong date.  Yesterday was September 13th and when I looked at the watch the date window displayed ""16"".  I read one other review someplace where someone said they had the same problem.  I chalked it up to bad luck...after all this is a fairly expensive watch, and anybody can make a lemon once in a while.

If the date displays incorrectly again, I will send it back to the store I bought it from."
Adult fit.
Pretty ring however the stone is really small does not look believable
"I normally wear a size 7, but I got the 6.5M because I wear these without socks and they fit perfect.  I didn't like that in the picture they have the shoe ties tucked away so you cannot see them.  To me, in the picture, it just looks like an x shape for the shoe ties, but that isn't the case.  They are actual shoes that you have to tie. Disliked that!"
"The style is cute, but the sweatshirt is a bit big and the red bled onto the white."
I was disappointed when I received this shirt.  It is very thin and very light but the tag says other wise.  It is still an ok shirt and I would recommend this item.  I wear a  XXL and I ordered a XXL and it is pretty big on me.  It may shrink a little after I wash it.
I bought for a themed auction but never ended up using it. It didn't fit well on my head.
"I wanted some nice metal cufflinks, and while I think these are made of metal, they feel like they're made out of plastic. I guess it doesn't matter if it's all for show, but there is just a general cheap quality to the cufflinks."
not alot of support.
"Pretty dress, but I didn't like the way the neckline laid on me."
"Shirt showed up on time. I ordered a xxl when I wear XL and the shirt was still to small.
I won't order again"
"The website opts to leave out ""hip"" measurement which is VERY important for this dress. I ordered the 2x because I fit the bust/waist parameters, however my hips are too wide for this lovely gown. If, perhaps, your hips are wider than your bust, and you can't go up a size, this is likely NOT the dress for you.
Sorry, my full figured sisters, keep searching. I know the struggle is real.
#FullFigureIsBeautifulToo"
Cute shoes for a costume but not true to size.  I am a size 7 and the 7 was way too small and the shoe was narrow.
"A solid shoe, fits sort of loose. But a little heavy, not a moccasin at all. I returned mine."
"I thought it was a different material. And I'm 5""4' so it's about 8 inches long."
I didn't like the quality of the dress but for the price I guess it was ok. I ordered the large I thought the dress was a little snug.
"I feel the colors are darker than I thought. The fit was ok.
It looks more like a costume than a dress.
I would not recommend."
"I'm still trying the shoes - to see if putting some ""bulk"" under the tops will make them fit tight enough to keep.
I may have to return them."
"Tight in the shoulders and baggy in the waist. Also the material is very satin like. Not exactly what I was expecting, but I love the pattern"
"very cute, but arrived broken. may order again sometime"
"I love clarks, my only gripe is the texture on the toe of these shoes pulls/scratches easily. One misstep on a stone/cement stair and it catches the hole texture and tears. No amount of shining will fix that. Next pair I get, not going to have that texture. As some other reviews have said, they can be a bit warm because of the inner material."
"Aside from them being much smaller than expected, they are some pretty good joggers. Make sure you buy up one size."
too small. otherwise it is ok for the price.
Nice boots just to narrow  !
I love the fact that the Bev Mev shoes are light weight and run narrow!!!  Too bad they also run short.  I usually wear size 11N but these shoes are just too short for me.  I wish they came in longer sizes.  (I could not wear a closed toe style of Bev Mev in size 42.)
Didn't care to much for the sides of the shirt if ordered in a larger size would make a good mini dress though
"Photo looks great, but bag sags after initial usage."
"For $20 you can't really expect much. The middle in front seems to be way to close together making the bra look weird. Feeling is light, kinda like memory foam and kinda throws me off. These will be hanging around the house or yard work bras..."
Cute. Overpriced. Runs large.
"Love the look.  Went by the suggestion of other reviewers and got a 37 even though I'm a 7.5-8.  The footbed fits like a glove but I've been wearing them on and off for a week and the thong still bothers me.  No blisters or anything, just more of a dull throb sensation.  Don't know if I would've been better off with the 38 or if the thong would bother me no matter the size.  I have high hopes that they will break in soon and the thong won't bother me anymore.  Fingers crossed..."
Large fit perfectly. ..but was too long...medium fit was too tight...but length was perfect.....I'm 5'4..160lbs
"A generous 3 stars for being soft, but does not hold its shape and even washed in cold and low dry, it shrunk after 2 washes. The size 4/5 (which should only be labeled as a 4 - only a tiny 5 year old could fit this) now fits like a 3T."
"This dress took a very long time to get here.  I ordered on March 10, hoping it would arrive by Easter.  It arrived April 2.  Just as well it was late, as I was disappointed when it finally arrived.  The white bodice part looks dirty/dingy.  The fabric is very starchy and will need extensive ironing after it is washed.  The skirt part is not a white background, it is a faded dingy pinkish coral color.  On a positive note, it is well constructed with a nice zipper in back.  It would be cute in a different fabric."
"Fine watch. Heavy, clean design. Keeps accurate time. Absolutely no issues with the part of the watch that keeps time, the case.

The band, however, is a complete abomination. Clarification. The band is fine, the clasp is a walking disaster of legendary proportions. If you set a mechanical engineer to design the most problematic, least functional, horror show of a clasp, it still wouldn't be as bad as the unit on this watch.

First of all, who puts a disconnecting clasp on a heavy men's watch? When you manage to undo the clasp, the watch case is heavy enough to instantly topple the watch over, sending it sliding off your wrist onto whatever surface is below your feet. But, at least it's not that easy to undo.

That's the second problem. It's easy to unlock the clasp, but getting the hooked lever side off of the bar that it locks onto is an exercise in pure frustration. Once unlocked, there is no easy way to push, pull, move the two parts of the clasp to easily and reliably separate the two free ends of the band. Push on the lever? No. Pull on it? No. Push while trying to lift the bar? No. The clasp locking mechanism is designed such that however you choose to grip or apply pressure fails to move the two free ends into a relationship where they readily separate. My description is a mess because the mechanism is a mess.

But you only have this problem if you get the watch on and clasp secured. When you try to close the clasp, it reliably gets stuck or wedged on the retaining bar and forcing it doesn't help. You have to jiggle it and sometimes undo it entirely and restart again to get the clasp over the bar it grabs onto and try and close it again. My god, but this thing is an unmitigated failure. I cannot imaging how this design made it past proving.

Now, once you have figured out how to get it on, you can at least remove links to achieve that perfect fit, right? Not exactly. Unlike a typical buckle clasp, there is no micro adjustment capability. There is no series of holes for you to move spring pins around in half-link increments to customize the fit to some wrists. If you're lucky, you'll get to the point where taking out just the right number of links makes the watch sit perfectly right above the wrist. If you're unlucky, like me, taking out 5 links will make the band too tight. Taking out 4 links makes it so loose that it slides down past the wrist so the crown digs into the back of your hand. Too bloody tight or too floppy loose. Take your pick.

I was sooo close to sending this back because I hated this disaster of a clasp so much. It really does sour the experience of an otherwise really nice, solid man's watch. Instead, I researched here and ordered a replacement band made by MiLTAT. Once that comes in and I've had a chance to install it, I'll be back to post my impressions and perhaps some photos.

So, bottom line is unless you really love the case and movement and can get it at a good price and are willing to deal with the mess of a clasp or buy a replacement band, stay away from this problematic unit. I just cannot imagine that any Victorinox could have given the green light for such a total train wreck of a band clasp."
I purchased several wicking shirts for an upcoming trip and this was my lease favorite because it was both more sheer and more boxy than the other brands. I would have liked it to be a little more fitted and flattering and not show the bra underneath so easily.
A bit loose and material is somewhat stiff. I have to wear a belt with it.
I love the color and the way it fits. so cute!
Also the shoes fit good. I thought at first they would be to small. But they are good
"Its a nice light fabric with a nice design but way way too big, even for a one size fits all/most."
"I received this product for free or at a discount in exchange for an honest review.

The material is sturdier than I excepted. Not easy to rip, which is good because the card slots are a VERY tight fit. Especially the 4 front ones. If you see the picture I've included, you can see that the snap gets in the way of you putting all 4 cards in completely or straight.

One of the clasps is very hard to open and close. It sticks. The other is perfectly fine.

The strap is not as high quality as the purse. It's been rolled up and shoved in the wallet/purse, so the wrinkles/lines are there even when hanging on your shoulder. You would probably need to put something heavy on the entire strap to straighten it out. I am just going to use this as a wallet and toss the strap though."
Seams ripped in the crotch after 1 wear in 2 pair
Way too big. Returned. Didn't like the product.
"Arrived in good condition, however this hoodie is a little thinner than I would have liked.  Also the decorative  stickers have not held up too well over multiple washings."
Not very high quality in my opinion.
I like the bra. I think I should have purchased a larger one (Not the cup size). I had to purchase bra extenders.
The color is great but they run very very large.
Read the reviews that said these shoes ran small...I didn't find that to be the issue with myself.  These shoes run right on size
"I wanted to love these so much......Great color, awesome cushioning, comfortable heel. However, the toe space in these shoes are very narrow. My other Merrells had ample toe room, but not these. My little toe was compressed and numb after just a few minutes of wear, and my feet are by no means wide. Sadly, I had to return them"
"I wasn't sure of the size so I got both medium and small. I usually wear small but I thought maybe a looser top might be more comfortable. This medium was too big for me so I returned it, keeping the small."
"There's something about the texture that I don't quite like, although I have to admit it is quite soft and warm.  It's just very synthetic, but not smooth.  One other minor annoyance is that the wrist cuff's are a little tight, whereas the rest seems to be fairly generously sized."
"I bought these for my girlfriend.  I ordered a size 8 which she usually wears. They were a bit too short.  Thanks to the great Amazon exchange policy I returned them for a size 9.  She is a long-time ""heel wearer"" and found these to the most comfortable heels she has ever worn.  They are a really beautiful sharp eye-catching shoe!!"
I wear a 32g in Wacoal cut n sew bras (this means that they are constructed in several pieces to provide the appropriate support for certain shapes). I thought this would fit the same; it did not. There was less coverage on the sides an did not fully cover the top area. I may just need a different size. It is a lovely bra. I gave it three stars since it the sizing was inconsistent compared to other Wacoal bras.
"Cool shirt, runs waaaay small. I ordered an XL and it fits like a M"
"I'm not sure who has the kind of curves to fit these jeans, but I have never met anyone curvy enough for this fit.  I'm not saying that person is not out there, I'm sure she is.  But it would take a special kind of 'curvy gal' to fit this jean.  Wow."
i would give five star but when i received it my fluffy ball wasn't even attached. Explain why it so cheap.you get what you pay for
Cheap stitching coming apart already at the waistband. Too bad because they are really cute lightweight pajamas.
"Its cute, fits me in my waist, but omg my poor breasts. They were trying to escape into my armpits. I'm 5'5"", 160lb with a full D cup and it fit everywhere except the top part. the cups are made for women with smaller breasts. My chest looked sad with this thing on which kind of stinks because it wasn't cheap and it's super cute."
I bought these just to try and they do fit but are a little tight on the thighs I have very muscular legs so this may be the reason although they do not look bad. They are really cute and the material is super soft how ever when I opened them they had the strong odor of gas and they took forever to get to me. The gas smell was awful it even rubbed off on my skin I hope that when I wash them an soak them in fabric softener it comes out cause I really want to wear them out. they fit me ok but come up a little high which is normal for me with leggings. I'm 5'5 about 125 give or take its holiday season and my measurements are 34 26 36
"I probably should have known this, given the fact that it's sterling silver (duh), but it's ... really shiny. That, and the fact that I ordered the one with small beads (2mm), combine to make this look a bit feminine. Hopefully it will look a bit more manly when it gets tarnished a bit!"
"This costume huge!!! Not for a 2 year old. More like a 5 year-old size. If you want your child to look like Fred instead of Bam Bam, it might work.  On the positive side, it will keep the child warm."
"the dress fit a little too big, and it doesnt have a liner/slip inside of the dress. But I do like the dress, very pretty fabric. I am not going to bother with returning it, I think I will just have it altered so it fits me perfect"
These have a pretty prominent seam on the inside at the toe line. I hope they will not be too uncomfortable.
"Good service, bras not the best"
Color is much brighter i than the appearance in the photos
"This is a great idea, but I'm not sure about the current implementation.  When putting this key into my computer it often connects and disconnects several times as it switches modes.  This results in the particular page asking for a code to error out.  I often have to try a couple of times before I can get everything aligned correctly and input the OTP from the key.  I really like this device, but I'm not sure how well it works.  To make matters worse, most places that support these will force you to use a backup, like phone number, in addition to this.  It defeats the purpose of this device if attackers can just select another commonly exploitable option."
They feel nice but I ordered a Med. It says Small / Med. on inside. It is on the small side. I would get a Large to extra large if your shapely and 150 lbs. Also pretty thin. Waist seems a little loose.
"I just don't prefer this type/model of sneakers, so I returned them..."
"Fit great when I first put them on but as the night went on I noticed they got baggy around the waist. I may need to just order a medium instead of a large. I'm 5'4"" 175 lbs. And generally wear a size 12 pants"
"I need to be fair about this shoe.  Although it did not work for me, it might be a good option for a Rhythm/Latin dancer.  I compete often and usually wear Ray Rose shoes but I recently injured my foot and was looking for a less expensive shoe that was still suitable in a lower heel.  They didn't work for me, but here is some information that my help you in your decision making process:

- Although it is a two inch heel, it looks quite attractive and not ""granny"" like.
- They are soft and easy to point in and you won't have to break them in.
- The color is perfect and the buckle doesn't dig in.
- The sizing is accurate.  For dancing I wear a European 5 and the American 7 was comparable.  But note that my street size is usually a 7.5 or 8.
Cons:
- I ordered the shoe in wide to see if it would accommodate my swollen foot, but I found the sole (not the straps) to be too narrow.  I ordered a M and a W and quite frankly there was little difference.
- This is a round toe.  Had they been square toe, then I think that they would fit better, but as a result, my foot rolled outward.

All in all, I do think that it is a good quality shoe suitable for competition, but it just didn't work for my foot."
"They are cute and fit well, they don't look like the photo however, they aren't as dark and don't look anything like jeans really. The butterflies are also more difficult to see."
"ther was a hole in one of the sleeves,  but nice shirt"
"Considering the large size of the watch, it is comfortable to wear.  The downside of such large watch face is that it get bumped very easily.  It is more difficult to program than other watches I've owned.  The buttons are large to match the large watch face, so the outward facing buttons get bumped easily.  One of the outward buttons is used for changing time zones.  Several times a week I am having to change the time zone back to my time zone because of that button getting bumped."
"I'm 5'3 120lbs, purchased a size S. I bought this to give me a better figure instead of having semi-prominent love handles. It definitely gets the job done, however all of my height (what little height I have) is in the length of my torso. This garment is not nearly long enough to reach up to under my breasts, so it gives me an awful back roll. I've never had back rolls in my life, so I don't think I will ever wear this. It was a nice thought, though."
The quality of the leather does not match the picture. It doesn't look as nice or have even the same color really. It's an nice enough looking wallet on its own but it's not what I wanted comparing image with what was received.
Looks nice - but should have gotten a size bigger.
"The shirt logo looks great, and it is a very comfortable cotton fabric. I'm not sure what  planet full of Lilliputian models they used to  figure out their sizes, because I ordered an XL when I usually wear a medium, and it looks painted on.  It's a good thing that the shirt is black, or I would've had to send it back."
Loved this bra until underwire snapped
Somewhat snug
Cute boots for the money. Kinda stiff so would wear if you have to be on your feet for long periods. Appear to be well made. made for fun and casual wear.
"I always buy these but this time, the fit is small."
I had to brush a lot so my daughter would wear it for her costume and trim it as well.
"Would not choose UnionBay for my small, petitie body again.  Nice jeans, just not my fit."
"It looks really cute, but it is VERY thin and see through. It also shrank a little in the dryer, so be careful of that. Mine doesn't have a zipper in the back either. It has a button in the front where the v-neck is instead."
Better off buying soccer shoes in person. Not bad but not great. A little too big. Difficult to tie up.
Same story............this was not bought for ME!
The style is ok but it is too thin.
"These are pretty cool little ear muffs. Convenient and the red is pretty.  However, they are not nearly as insulating as regular ear muffs, so i have to give only 3 stars."
"5' 8"" and this shirt shows a little belly. About 1"". FYI."
They didn't last long looking new. The material is cheap.
cute... but smaller sizing than US for sure...
"I wanted to live this so much, but it was too small for my wallet! :( Besides that it was super cute and appeared to be well made, I returned it due to size."
not the support I expected - okay for slouching around - but not much good for walking of any distance
comfortable if you don't have any foot problems...
cheaper than pictured but worked for what we needed them for
"Ok boxers, very thin material. I don't imagine that they will make it past a few washes. Disappointed."
This looks exactly like the pic. It is itchy but that was a minor issue. It fits great and does the job
"I normally wear a Medium.  After reading all the reviews, I purchased an XL.  The top fit perfectly, although didn't appear right.  Because this product was stuffed in a tiny bag, not folded correctly, the top padded area was wrinkled. Like a permanent wrinkle that you can't iron out so your chest looks like it has indents in it.  The bottoms were small.  Tight around the waste and super narrow in the leg openings.  I'm not a big person. I'm considered perhaps a little tiny under weight for my height and weight yet the leg openings would totally cut off my circulation.  That's how tight they were. I thought about altering the shorts to widening the leg area but decided against it.  The color was really nice and I was really hoping to be able to wear this but sadly cannot.  I'm not sure how the model in the picture can fit into it.

This product was purchased at a discount for my honest review."
"Top is too small, not enough coverage/support for the girls (D)."
"This watch is big. Unfortunately the electronic display is not large enough for an older person to read without glasses. So the watch's appeal would lie primarily with younger folks with good close vision. The analog hands cover up the digital time readout around half past the hour. The date readout to the left side is similarly small, and covered up at quarter to the hour by the hands. The third digital display on the right side consists of a bunch of flashing dots that gradually fill in the same repeat pattern as they build up to one minute, and then it goes blank and starts refilling. This seems a waste of space and battery life unless you are really bored. The watch is supposed to be good underwater down to 330 feet, but I haven't tested that. It also has other functions such as a stopwatch and lap timer, which some may find useful. It appears to be very sturdy for it's price range, which is good since it will surely take it's share of knocks because of it's large size. It seems worthwhile if you like the styling.

Update: After 15 months the hands started losing time badly. I replaced the battery (CR2025) and the situation did not improve. While the electronic readout still keeps time, it's too small to be usable, so for me the watch is now useless. I expect longer life out of a watch, so I reduced my rating from 4 to 3 stars."
You get what you pay for. Don't expect this to replace your expensive $un glasses
The spikes are bigger then what I am use to. But over all I love the colors
"A lot smaller than I thought they would be , but they're still cute, I gave them to my 3 year old niece"
"I like the look of the boot, but runs very small.  I'm normally a size 9 and ordered 9 1/2.  Unfortunately, I'll return instead of going for a size 10 (have never needed a 10).  I believe the running small comes in the width, although ordering a 1/2 size up was cutting a bit close on length as well."
It looks like the picture.  Very understated.
These shoes had a strange fit on me - could be my feet?  They are very padded and comfortable so may be good for others.  When I tried them on the front strap did not lay flat on my foot but it raised up.  They seemed like good quality but I had to return due to fit.
These really didn't fit me even thought the sizing suggested they would. I am a size 12 and they are too tight and don't come high enough. Will give them to a friend who is smaller.
Looks nice.... but heavy
"Attractive color and design, but the material is a bit scratchy and uncomfortable. I haven't tried them as a thermal layer yet. As a stand-alone layer for around the house, they aren't very warm but they are likely generate attention from your significant other."
Very confusing sizes. I purchased what they call an XXXL. I would say this is about a USA size 8-10 misses or 9-11 junior. It will be going to my daughter-in-law.
"This was extremely comfortable and looked good, but I would advise that the cool air memory foam description is false. It is no different than the other sketchers shoes that don't have it. After wearing it to the office one day, my feet were wet with perspiration. Sorry tmi! I don't have like weird sweating habits, but unless I am wearing leather shoes or socks, I cant do these kinds of shoes. I wish I could, and I think socks would look weird with these. These also ran about a half size large."
"Will hide under shorts, but does not cover the area you need to keep from rubbing all that well. Just a so so product."
"I'm sorry to say that I'm somewhat disappointed in these panties. While the color & finish of the fabric is as seen in the picture, I'd be willing to venture this model's wearing an XL. I'm underweight right now (about  5'5"", 105-110 lbs), and per the manufacturer's advice ordered the Medium. While they technically fit, they aren't very flattering. They stretch some  - and maybe it's because I don't have a rock hard body - but mostly they kind of lightly dig and don't quite cover the rear area on me like they do on the model to a flattering effect. My husband likes them on me but I don't feel comfortable or attractive in them. My recommendation: unless you have major yoga booty you might want to skip these for something more flattering."
These fit great in the length department and around the waist but my Dont kept tripping because there is no range of motion in the legs. He's 18 months 32 ilbs and tall
"Honestly can't say how it fits. My father needs 2 pocket flannel tops so he can carry his cell in one and his glasses in another. I order this and then found it in another store way, way cheaper. Granted though, I am sure this top was probably heavier and nicer quality. But I never took it out of it's pkg to find out. Just shipped it back."
"These are a beautiful boot. I like them, but don't LOVE them. To start with the positives, they are comfortable and good looking. However, they are too tall, so when I bend my knee they jam into the back of my knee. They have pretty large calves, so they make my legs look bigger than they really are. I'm getting pretty tired of the boot industry catering to large calves and leaving the smaller calved people out in the cold (ha, literally!). I wear boot cuffs to help with this problem. However, they are large all the way through the ankle, too, so my whole leg just looks too large. And the zipper pulls smash and rub against each other as you walk. The leather is pretty stiff, so if you do a lot of bending and moving in your daily life that's just not comfortable (I'm a preschool teacher, so I'm moving and bending and crouching constantly, but I like to dress well!). Overall, I wouldn't buy them again. Since they are a gift from my husband, I'll at least wear them on dates."
I thought this was super important to have but really not necessary. I would rather wear a normal bra all day then switch to this one whenever I need to pump. Working mom's don't need.
This is a classic fit so if u r looking for slim fit then this sweater would be big for u.
They are a darker pink. Not as light as shown but cute.
"I'm usually a medium in leggings so that's what I got. They fit as I thought the would. I want to say they are loose up near your vagina but not like extremely loose. Like there's room for you to breathe. I got the ""neon green"" and let me tell you. Its NEON YELLOW. They're cute though. I'm 5'1, 110 pounds. and they are not ""see through"" on me. I tried them on, had them on for about 10 minutes and they seems to stretch or get kinda loose around the waits band"
"I'm going to preface with that I'm have full chested individual (36-38D). It's ok. There's nothing defective about the product. As it states, it has an underwire which is not recommended for nursing since it can constrict milk flow.  It's stretchy in the material area - which again if your full chested may or may not be a good thing.  For the smaller chested person it may be fine since it does have room for growing chest but I would rather wait till you have the baby to see what size you need.

I ended up (through another recommendation) purchasing a Hotmilk - FOREVER YOURS nursing bra (you can go to their website directly) I bought 4 of them - it looks and feels pretty much like a regular underwire bra but doesn't have a wire."
"I like the dress and the fabric, I bought one for my sister and she loved it, so I bought a second one for me.  The dress looks horrible on me, somewhere between my boobs and my butt, this IS NOT the dress for me."
"I tried both pieces on the pants were miles too long, the top was tight.  I just finished washing in cold water will see how they fit now?"
The side pockets are made of mesh and do not hold  well to everyday use. My son loved it having his school colors.
"I love the comfort of yoga pants; the stretch accommodates a full range of motion. But this brand is not as well made as the other brands (ODODOS, for instance). The material is flimsy and attracts lint like crazy. The cut is close; it's tight in the leg all the way to the knee. The color is attractive and works with the tops I have. And the price is substantially less than the other brands. So I gave it a three star."
"its smaller than expected, and i tried to stretch it over a chair for literally a week and it kept shrinking back :/ order a size up! since its a monokini, if its a big big, it'll stay on just fine"
Very pretty earrings however I ordered them as a gift for my mother in law and she wanted to return them because she said they were too heavy.
Good slippers but too small
I should have looked up Rose Gold IP before I purchased.  It means it is ion plated. After 1 week the color faded but it is still a nice gold color.  For $1.99 it wasn't a bad purchase.  I love the fit and the thickness and width. Just a little disappointed that the color has already faded.
It feels a little chintzy not as classy as I wanted!
Really loved the earrings model. The quality was not good. They arrived with one stone almost coming off and the loops were sea green instead of navy blue. So I had to return them.
"I gave this 3 stars because for the price, the material was fair and it looked cute. But the sizing was a big problem. I ordered a SMALL and a LARGE and none fit me right. LARGE was too tight and very short on my butt and loose on my chest, whereas the SMALL wouldn't even go up past my hips. I'm 5'5"" and weight 132lbs. on the athletic side. 34C and size 3/4 pants."
It's me not the pants.
"I love the colors and styles of the scrubs that dickies has, but the material is stiff and somewhat inflexible. I prefer Cherokee. This top is very cute and stylish though."
"The description I first saw of this made it sound like just a general moisturizer.  It's changed since them to focus more on post-menopausal skin.  I'm not menopausal yet let alone post.  But I do have skin that is fairly sensitive and that gets dry very easily.  So I figured this couldn't hurt.

The good news is that my skin definitely feels tighter and better moisturized than it has been lately.

The bad news is that the scent is too overpowering for me so I cannot use it regularly.

Great if you don't mind a strong scent.  If, like me that is a deal breaker for you, I'd try something else."
"Thick polyester.. however, good collection"
Great looking shoe...Not as comfortable as I would like...
Much smaller than I though it would be.
"My favorite brand disappointed me this time. The fit is just ""off"" like cheaper shoes that aren't cut carefully. I've had trail running NB before which had good stability so that I wouldn't strain a foot or ankle on uneven ground. These are sort of the opposite. They feel floppy no matter how I tied them. Because they fit weird, I think they look weird too.
They are light and may be cooler because of the thinner material, but those are about the only good things I can think of.
I've had many great pairs of New Balance before.
So here's a NB first for me- I don't recommend these. Next time I will pay a bit more and get something of better quality."
"I bought this chain as a gift for someone who wanted a chain for wearing pendants.  This chain is very thin and fine.  Before gifting it, I gave it a little tug and since it's a Rolo is was reasonably strong, but I would only wear it to showcase a pendant and not as a ""statement"" necklace of any kind."
Not as snug as I expected.
I'm a size 7 and these shoes are too narrow at the toe.
The light doesn't reach the end of the lightsaber. I know it's cheap but I hoped that the whole thing would at least be illuminated.
"This is a dry clean only 100% wool shirt.  I have several of these and they are well built, great shirts for those cold winter days.  However, what Amazon sent me was balled up in a resealed bag.  I know how these are packaged from the factory.  They are flat packed and pinned with support for the collar like a dress shirt is packed.  Disappointed that sent out an obviously returned item and sold it as new."
"Ordered 10.5 and was too small, had to upsize to 11."
"I returned these....nice enough, but not what I was looking for."
Snug around the upper arms but love the longer back!
"It looked beautiful when I received it and wore it once. Then I washed and dried it, and it faded and had fuzzy balls all over. I can't wear it because it looks worn out."
"Arch support metal came out and the inside bottom came out...only worn about 4 times.
Tried to contact company and Amazon says not eligible for return...Nice looking but not well built
No more Chinese for me"
I ordered a larger size because so many reviews stated that this shirt runs small and I wish I wouldn't have.  My son is a little on the heavy side and the reviews were stating that the shirt runs small so I ordered a size larger thinking that due to his size this wouldn't be a problem but it was. The shirt fits him like a dress.  Guess we will put in the dresser and bring it back out in a couple of years when it will fit better.
"It's a personal thing; I don't really like having the top of the shoe extend too far up the instep, and this one does.  It is also a bit snug, not so much that I could say it doesn't fit, but snugger than I find workable for a shoe with that much instep coverage."
"I wear mediums and they are usually pretty close to being too small. This medium is bigger than larges I have tried on from other brands. The material used is stiffer and less comfortable than my other scrubs. Also, the front pocket has a stitched divider which makes it so my phone just barely fits with a lot of squeezing. I haven't had this problem with other scrubs. Won't be buying more of these."
"My hubby had tried the shoe on in a store and loved it, but wasn't quite ready to buy it. A few months later, we bought it off Amazon. All was fine and dandy until the right shoe decided to squeak with every step after only a week or so of wear. It alternates between being funny and gratingly annoying."
Nice suit just not for me
"Do you know what I appreciate about this watch the most? It's large, easy to read face. I use reading glasses and so many watches that look great I really have to squint to read. This watch has a sturdy, rugged band and a high contrast display. What more can you ask for?"
"Yup, other reviewers are correct--the webbing curls (in the narrow direction, as if it is trying to turn itself into a rope instead of a belt) much to easily.  After one wearing it was clearly deformed.  Too bad--the buckle is of high quality, and the brown color is the best of all the brown belts of this type I tried (different than the wider ""military"" version of this belt, which is the more typical ""milk chocolate"" brown)--it is a deeper, darker brown with slightly olive hints.  Manufacturer--fix the curl, keep the color, and you will have a great belt!"
"This wallet is made of coated leather, which is cheaper to produce than genuine leather wallets. The coating on the wallet is polyurethane and the finished product is generally referred to as PU leather. We have had office chairs made of this material and after some time, the PU starts peeling off in little pieces. as for the wallet, I like the size - which is a little smaller than most, has RFID blocking for your credit and passport cards, and even has a zippered inside for your paper money. The license holder is a bit on the small size and you will struggle to fit your license in the slot. Just give up and use a credit card slot instead. The tin that the wallet comes in is quite nice."
A little tight in the seat and leg openings.
Beautiful dress but very thin. I like the pattern on this dress so its a keeper
Great if u have a small stomach.
There is no support so this is not for any woman w a b cup or bigger really. Too bad bb
"Its cute, but a little small.  It was supposed to be delivered in 2 days.  It came a week later which was too late to use it as planned."
The quality of general
Light weight material and cheap waist band but a good fit.
Didn't fit my calf
Not as described and poorly made. If it wasn't such a steal Id give a lower rating. Would be useful for travel but otherwise isn't great.
"This brush is okay, but not great. the handle is flimsy and the brush is small. Not what I was expecting."
Here's my issue-when I placed my order I chose hi-cut not briefs! I've even gone back and checked the product again against my order and I did not order briefs so I am not happy with the fact I was sent a different type so buyer's beware. However they are a nice soft cotton.
"These fit funny. They're the really dry cotton-y kind of material (good on hot days at least), not the silky kind. I have the same brand/size/etc. in a silky material which is what i was hoping for. But these don't fit as well--they kind of ride up? There's plenty of room for my butt, but it's like they're a little narrower back there? I don't know how to say it. They're baggy but at the same time a little narrow? It's really odd. I try not to wear them unless I'm out of other underwear because they can get uncomfortable in my jeans with extra material while at the same time needing to pull them down to prevent a wedgie. It's weird. Never did find more of the silky ones."
Very nice looking shoe.  It's hard for me to find shoes since I require a 5e width.  Still breaking the shoes in but they have no padding in them at all.  Not what I expected since they were just about $100.00.
Material is very thin and length is a tad long and width is less then as advertised. Hence two stars less. Not recommended.
"The Pants is not Iron Free. It is creasing to easily.
The button at the top of the zippier needs to be properly attached."
"So yeah....this is a basic titanium band.  I purchased this as an inexpensive temporary replacement for my real wedding band because I injured my finger and my normal band isn't fitting at the moment.  The band I received had clearly been worn before.  It was pretty scratched up.  I'm surprised that this was even sent out.  I kept it anyway because it's not like I'm getting married with it and I'm just going to scratch it up anyway.  But I can see how a groom-to-be would be pretty upset if they had received their ""new"" ring only to discover it's not really new."
A little too fitting. Order one size up
"I wouldn't necessarily recommend these socks. I think the primary reason for toed socks is to provide more mobility to your toes while running, extend your pinky toe, that kind of thing. I guess I just don't see the point here. You don't get more or less mobility with the right kind of shoe, and these are obviously more trouble to take on and off. Really, unless you're wearing Vibrams, I just don't see the point. Good sock, but not really necessary."
I ordered a loose size Medium Champion long sleeve tee with the logo above the heart and the logo on the wrist of the left arm. I received a loose size Medium Champion long sleeve tee with the logo above the heart and no logo on the wrist of the left arm. Disappointed.
The exterior looks great but the plastic is very thin and the elastic strap is cheap.
"Just did a test run so far but it seems a little loose.  I was looking for something tight fitting for winter cycling.  However, for the price it will suffice and I'm pretty confident keep me warm where I need it to."
"They are OK, but near the bottom of the New Balance line of trail running shoes. The frustrating part is that Amazon lowered the price by $7.00 a few days after I bought my new shoes!"
"I would give this 3 1/2 stars.

This was purchased for my husband. The size was fine - he is 5'10'' and about 200 lbs. But the quality of the fabric was not very good. I read the other reviews, and saw good responses, so I guess I had high hopes.

He got this as a Phantom of the Opera costume. Mostly we needed a cape, and this one looked good. As other reviews said, the hat is not good at all, but we didn't need the hat. The buttons on the vest are coming off, so we stitched them back on, but the vest looked (and felt) really cheap, so he opted not to wear it at all. He wore the red neckerchief with the cape, (along with black dress pants and a white dress shirt that he already owned) along with a phantom of the opera mask, and that was a good enough costume.

Over all the costume is ok, but not amazing. The quality is pretty dodgy. Also, the cape is longer than shown in the photo, and my husband is 5'10''"
"My 2.5 year old is tiny. He weighs a whopping 25 lbs due to chemo and we have a very hard time finding underwear that don't sag in the waist or legs for him. These fit perfectly.
That being said, if you have a heavier child these probably will be on the small size post wash and dry.
Also- Ryder isn't Featured as a main character and my son was a little bummed with that."
"I ordered this swimdress in a XXL.  I usually wear a L or XL, but swimsuits tend to be small, so I ordered the XXL.  I could not even get the bottoms to my knees and the top...no way.  My daughter is a size 6 said it was just a little too big for her.  Otherwise...this is a beautiful swimdress."
"Okay, they sure beat many alternatives, but they run big and they aren't specific. There are many types of blood thinners and some pose more serious dangers than others. I have similar bracelets marked Coumadin, which are -- in my case -- preferable."
"You get what you pay for with these...They are really cheap and feel very cheap.  The glue that holds them to your face is pretty weak and comes off quickly.  They are fun for what they are, but don't expect real looking mustaches that hold on to your face all night."
"These are okay...I bought them for everyday wear...I had a pair of Saucony Jazz shoes when I was much younger that I wore out until they were completely dead so I thought I would give these a try.  Sadly, these hurt my feet after a day at work.  Granted...I do not work ""normal"" hours and my feet can be very picky.  (I work very long shifts and have flat feet :) )  They just don't offer enough shock absorption or cushion for all day wear and I would definitely never consider running in them as I have seen some people mention.  I don't think they were worth the money to be honest.  Also, I know I usually EVENTUALLY will get stinky feet but not within weeks of owning shoes.  These don't breathe right, or the fabric must absorb all my sweat because they really don't smell good and normally that won't happen to me for a VERY long time with shoes.  I do appreciate that they are vegan and the style is great, but other than those two positives, they are just a mediocre shoe."
"It feels old.
Watch the screen. The older one, the older one.
It is not becoming on my little daughter to ..."
I ordered the wide but my fourth toe was pressing against the edge of the shoe.  The shoe tapers too quickly in the toe box.  Otherwise the shoe is light...unfortunately I had to return them.
"Its really short, so I couldn't wear it out in public, but thats not whatI bought it for, so It works for me. Besides that it fits everywhere else pretty okay."
"I thought that this would be a great deal, I was wrong!  The quality is just okay and the sweater is NOT true to size at all."
"The fabric is smooth. However, the size was too small. If I need to purchase this item in the future, I will buy a bigger size."
i was not pleased with the width the way it fits for a EE.  should have ordered a 4E
"A little tight. They do stretch slightly and feel much better. Reason for 3 stars. I do like the shoes and I am strictly a trail/ off road runner.
  After 41 miles the sole of the right shoe, center of the ball of your foot came off. I contacted Saucony to report the issue. They said they were sorry that these shoes did not work out for you.
Then directed me to another model of trail shoe.
Love saucony shoe but I am not impressed w/ customer support."
Rather thin shirt material. Fit slightly small.
"I like this belt - it is stretchy and easy to get on/off. I'm 5'4, 100 lbs, and the Small in Beige fits fine, but is still a bit too long. It's not noticeable wearing jeans, but wearing over a shirt dress, I have too much extra length. Also, it's not as flexible as a leather or canvas belt, so you can't tuck the end under without a huge bulge, and it doesn't feel very comfortable over thin material. Again though, with jeans, or pants with belt loops, it's fine."
I like that you can convert im the front and back.
"run big, i usually wear a size 8.5/9 however these came really big for a size 9. order a size down."
"I was hoping for a thinner fabric. They kind of felt like they were made for someone who was really large in the the thighs.  Not very ""performance"" because they are thick and get hot.  Hopes this helps."
I had to return it and I was dissappointed. After a closer look I understood the cup was padded and I can't do padded cups.
this is for the shower it makes a shower better this way an even for the home no more stinky feet
"I so very, very much wanted to be able to wear this shoe!  I ordered my size, and the length and width were great but the heel is too wide so the back of the shoe flips and rubs with each step,  The quality of this shoe is evident throughout, when standing only they are wonderfully comfortable, I wish I could walk in them."
after reading all reviews I bought these a size larger thay are a little snug thay have lasted for six months now thay are an ok underwere for ths price
"The fit is just right. Material is thin; but, great for warmer weather."
I ordered these a half size larger because they're ballet flats. They pinched my little toes even though they were long enough. No elastic around the top of the shoe meant they gapped as I walked. I returned them.
The Bali women's shapewear is okay.
These were for my sister and she is constantly saying how uncomfortable and big they fit.  Loves the look though.
"Very Thin, with little to no added fullness to my daughters dress."
Great jacket a little small very thick. I really like this jacket but it could be a bit larger. looks good.
"The boots are super cute, but as one other reviewer previously stated they are incredibly hard to take off and you can't wear jeans with them.  I have to send them back."
"gives you major support...but certainly not a sexy thing at all. It's almost like the girls have been bad and they are now in jail....very tight, very uncomfortable by days end."
"I LOVED this bathing suit...but it did not fit my body. :(  I have a long torso for my size (66 inch torso), and a small chest (36B), so I ordered a medium (8-10). The top part was way too big for me, the bottom part was perfect, but the middle part was too short and when I tried to pull the suit up, the bottom came up farther than I'm comfortable with, like those old Baywatch swimsuits that show the pelvic bone/hip area. I wish it fit, though. It is really gorgeous"
Not all cotton as I hoped.  I can't tolerate anything with polyester in it.  It's too hot to wear.
excellent . Love it.
"Feels a bit cheap, but does its job, fits into tiny bags, and cute!"
"Not as nice looking as the picture .
Kind of cheap looking .
Not a guy tshirt ."
Material is too rough after few wash kinda looking like rag
Very good....Thank You....!!!!!!!
Looked great. Felt soft. Too small.
"These are socks that are meant to be worn with slacks.  Jeans, not so much.

They have good width on the foot and nice cushion that would feel nice in a work shoe.

The top is about an inch lower on the calf then I prefer.  They are the same height as the Dockers socks.  The Izod are an inch taller.

Not too crazy about the stretch in the calf section.  A little too much constriction, takes a long time to pull them on over the foot.

Going to stick with the Izod."
"In concept this is a great looking feeling gym bra, I wear a 38 F and purchased the XL based on reviews. I didn't have the same issues with getting  the bra on / being to tight around the ribs, it was a bit too roomy around for a size 38, but the cup size was too small for a DDD / F. I returned this item based on the awkward fit of being both too big and too small."
These are just as pictured. They appear that they will be at least average in durability but seem to be just a little short for my usual size.
"I bought the XS and it is considerably larger than the XS I purchased in a different style from the same company. I tried shrinking it in the dryer, and that somewhat helped, but I definitely would have gone smaller if I had known the size discrepancy. I am never an XXS. I normally am an XS in scrubs and a S in normal clothes. I am 5'3'' 34D and around 128lbs if that helps. It is ok for the price, but I probably would just spend the extra bucks on Med Couture. Was disappointed, because I really liked the color."
That hat came creased and bent in some places. It is a gift so I have no comments as to fit.
Sits below waist. Very slim fit
ok but little dissapointed at the fabric
I liked (purchase as a gift) but my 24yr old didn't like the feel of the fabric ... He said it was a bit too thin ...
It was my fault because I didn't measure how big it was. But....I was alittle deceived when I read it was a hand bag. To me a hand bag suggest small to medium. If I'm correct.
These didn't quite fit my son's size 10 foot. He was disappointed.
Great shoe but the wide needs to be a bit wider.
I didn't like the material.  the size is definitly for plus size women.
Cute hat but not for me.
Good for the price but the grasp is a bit lacking. The color is good and they are nice.
I ordered the XXL which should have fit according to the chart. They were a little snug.  I have found that Capezio products tend to run a little small.  Everything else about these tights is amazing. They stretch and wear well. the transition is easy from footed to non footed.
this shirt is very long
"I wish the belts on these shorts was attached somehow; I had to confiscate the belt because my kiddos were trying to use it as a leash - on an arm thankfully, but better safe than sorry!!"
"Lovely shoe, it's what I expected for support. Nice for arch support & plantar fascia issues. However, I wish I got a half size larger. It runs tight in the toe area.
*** I returned these, and had planned to get a half size larger, however they charged me $10 out of my refund for ""promotion deduction"". I am pissed and plan to argue this. So, be careful and read all return info."
not good. Ugly
"Beautiful suede. Comfortable insole. However, I didn't realize the boot shaft was not lined. Therefore, it turns into an awkward slouch boot. Especially because I have thinner calves. I only wore them once."
seemed to strech too much and then does not regain the fit it had
"It's cute on the picture, but it's quality is poor."
"Gave it a three stars because it's not my type of thing to wear. Got it to make my halloween costume. debated whether to get this one or a different one. this one had better reviews so got this one, but it was alot more tighter than i thought."
"It doesn't hold up well, but the price is good for a one-time wear."
"They actually broke the 3rd time I wore them and unfortunately it was a couple of days after the 30 day refund policy. However, I emailed Reef directly and they replaced them."
"Love the pattern, but the nubbiness makes them not as soft as I had anticipated.  In addition, the top elastic is just too tight.  My legs are sensitive to pressure, and it hurts me--so I wouldn't term these ""world's softest""!"
"UPDATE!

The belt fell into pieces....not a biggie...but also not really something I did expect within 6 weeks.....

I bought them for around the house and garden, they fit really well, came with a belt as an added value.
I found some of the sewing looks a bit shabby, but for the price, if they hold a season I am fine.

if i realize more problems, I will update my review as I always do.

If you have questions, please ask, if I can I will answer any question"
"Cheap, but well designed."
I ordered this in xxl and I wear a lrg. didn't even come close to fitting. Belt? What belt? Material is nice.
"I bought these boots for my 10 year old as, he complained of his feet being cold when he played in regular boots in the snow.  It kept his feet dry and warm however, when he takes it off the boots have a tendency of the insulation sticking to his socks which can cause it to be difficult for him to take off by himself. It looks a little clunky on his feet, but more importantly he's warm and comfortable."
My daughter wore it once and the lining is already ripping.  The color is beautiful
"I can't tell if this shirt wasn't a good cut overall or just wasn't a good cut on me. The neckline and shoulder area was too wide, so I felt like I was constantly pulling the neck in so it wouldn't show my bra straps. The dolman part under the armpits really sagged, so it took away from my shape and made me look apple-shaped since my waist was filled in with extra fabric- I had no curves. The fabric was thin and the gray felt lighter than I wanted. All around it looked drab and droopy. I returned the product but had a smooth return process. I really like this brand and have rated some of the other items I've bought high, so maybe it was just this shirt on me."
"The material to this dress is VERY soft, like flannel PJs, though lighter weight/thinner than expected. The buttons are sewn on well and a brown contrast/courderoy runs underneath the buttons (you don't see it while buttoned, but it is a nice contrast/seen if you keep the top buttons in bottoned). This contrasting brown courderoy material is used as the elbow patches seen in the photos. This material is quite thin/less robust than expected. The dress is fitted nicely throughout. However it is longer than described. I am 5'7""/120# and ordered the size small. The front of the dress fell at about knee length with the back quite far below my knees. So on me, especially in the large print, it appeared more like a nightshirt than a dress (even when I tried belting it) Disappointing because it really is a cute comfy dress and appears to be made fairly well. If it were shorter and in a less overwhelming print, I'd love it (prin looked more overwhelming in person)  5 stars to the seller for quick arrival, but I will be returning it."
"Though my newborn was average size, the dress fit only till a month before she outgrew it"
I look for style and support from my dance shoes. Nice style but lacks the support needed on the dance floor!
"This review is being written for shoes purchased for my son- Sweet looking well built shoe but disappointed with the fit.  The toe box, while wide enough,  is very low and tight which makes your toes feel like you have heavy weights sitting on top of them.  Even with skinny narrow feet!  Ordering a half or full size up would make no difference when it comes to this. Unfortunately have to return but hoping to find another Emerica style With a taller space in the toe area."
"They didn't keep feet warm, I walked in the snow feet was very cold, don't recommend for the snow, put a lot of socks on"
"Covered whole finger, a lot bigger than expected."
Nice dress. I wore it. Shabby material tho.
"Very pretty, but need to be careful when putting these on.  The metal on the posts is very soft and bends easily."
"I like the way the bag looks, but whatever material it is made with is rather loud, it makes a crinkling noise whenever you put something in or take something out of it, Not really good if you are trying to be quiet."
"The shirt is funny. This shirt is well-made thick cotton. The shirt fits just fine.

BUT there is a typo in it and that almost made me send it back. The apostrophe is upside down and backwards. Christ on a cracker, c'mon people!"
"A little mushy, but okay for casual wear. Would not recommend for hiking any rugged foot traffic.  Great appearance."
It was ok. The leather has a faded look.
"I paid a bargain price for a good looking shoe. I got what I paid for. There are some problems with the shoes. #1 They stink! My whole family asks what the smell is. They smell awful straight out of the box and two weeks later still smell bad. I think it is the glue that was used but man they stink.
They are on the narrow side and tight on my high arch. I had to loosen the laces completely to get my foot in. The left heal is not cut correctly; it is not flat under my foot.
I have worn them a total of 4 hours."
"Purchased this for my boyfriend and it didn't sit well with his already super sweaty feet.  The inside is very thick and would work best in a climate, not necessarily Texas where its hot and humid.  Still a very good shoe and great for lounging in."
fits okay enough to keep. It'll be nice for spring
"I love Yellow Box flip flops but this shoe is a disappointment.  The fabric that goes across the top of the foot is scratchy and irritates my skin.  Otherwise, it has the great sole and look you would expect from Yellow Box."
"its ok, fabric is way stretchy, very slim fit not for me. the print is not bright like in photo colors where dull and did not pop. i think would work great for some, just not what i was expecting"
These run smaller than my other Dickes of the same style.
I ordered what I thought was my new size since I've lost weight and the dress is skin tight :-(
"I just want to start with saying that this bag is durable as well as stylish, and I do love this bag. Unfortunately, due to the way this bag opens, it is not easily accessible. I find myself just dumping everything out of the bag on a regular basis just to grab my wallet or makeup bag.

The flap that attaches to the side of the bag makes it awkward to reach into the bag to grab stuff out. Also, the dimensions make it narrow and long, which doesn't allow for much room to search around inside of the bag.

So, if you are looking for a bag to use daily as a purse or messenger bag, and have more than just the minimal amount of items to carry around, I wouldn't suggest this bag.

But, if you are looking for something to carry around books, notepads, or an iPad, this would make a long-lasting, reliable bag."
"My sister told me that she loved her Underarmer shoes, so I bought a pair . I don't like the arch and they are not nearly as comfortable as others I have. I will not buy any more."
"Quality is great, size is very small .."
A rubber sloe would have helped.  He slips on floors in these. and the rocks bite through to his foot. Not so good for these reasons.
"Still in packing, ask after the holidays"
Sorry I return them.
"This is such a strange dress. I tried two different sizes and neither fit. The smaller was way too tight in the ribcage, as this dress has no stretch. The larger was HUGE in the breasts. And I am a DD cup! So bizarre. I sent back both."
"it is very pretty, but it broke within 2 months of wearing it daily."
Posts are too thick to fit in ear lobes
"The jacket is very nice, but with a pair of uses starts to look old."
"I decided to get this product as an introduction to make-up for my 12 year old. It is very easy to apply, with just the tap of a button, the make-up appears on the brush. It flows smoothly and effortlessly onto the cheek and blends in quickly. The brush did not stay stiff once the product was on it. I decided to try it too, so I could write this review from my own experience as well.

Though it offers a little brightening, I honestly don't see much of a difference or much shimmer on my face when wearing the skin illuminator. I was hoping for more of an impact. I don't wear foundation or blush, as I really don't like the feel of face make-up, so I was hoping this product would give me a little extra without the heaviness I find with traditional blushes, etc. The good news is, once applied, I did not feel it at all. The bad news is that it is really hard to tell when it has been applied. This was true for both my daughter and myself."
"Runs a little small. Tried to stretch and they fit better.  I cannot were them with socks but can with nylons and feel comfortable.
For the price I cannot really complain.  You get what you pay for."
"Not a bad shoe, wanted something with a little higher heal.  Rather that an everyday shoe, I was looking for a dress/evening shoe.  This shoe looked like it would work base of pic, but when I got it home and tried it on, was not what I had hoped."
The ring looks nice but is rough with sharp edges.
"The shoe is nice, however too wide for my foot.  I put extra insole so that made it more comfortable."
My mothe loved them!
"The links that connect the shoulder strap are made of plastic, so when you walk the plastic-on-plastic squeaks with every step. I've been meaning to get a cobbler to replace them with metal links, but I keep forgetting until I'm walking with it on the street.

I end up using the handles mostly, but as the stitching rubs together I see it's starting to wear down after a few months."
You get what you pay for...somewhat thin. I strongly suggest using this shirt for warmer weather.
"decent sweater, idk if the price was justified but this sweater is VERY Big & Tall, I should have bought 2 sizes smaller being a regular sized person."
"I have literally 8 other pairs of Nine West boots and I am always a size 7.  The circumference of the shaft can get tight so I went with the wide calf on this one.  The footbed is very narrow, unlike any other pair of boots I own.  I would definitely have to size up.  I also have pretty beefy calves and there was a comical amount of space around them.  Such a shame since they are a lovely color.  I will try a half size up in the non-wide calf version."
"It's still in the ""getting used to"" stage."
Looks very cute on and is easy to style. I know this is a men's wig but was the best choice for my cosplay. It is a little thin but if you don't have much hair and style it properly it works great. I have really long hair but am used to wearing wigs.
Im 51 125ibs and a 32DDD. Usually I prefer a medium because i like things loose. This was cute but i should have got a large because the lace atop just short of my but. I would have to wear spandex under neath if i wore as a dress.
"loved that it was so versatile, was a great add for 4th of July. Took quite a while to receive though"
"Pants nice but size chart way off. My measurements said get a 3x. I'm a size 20 woman. 1x would have been plenty big. The crotch hangs half way to my knees. I can pull the waist band out front about 8"" from my body."
"very cute, but runs a little bit large"
The colors are very pretty. Unfortunately there is nothing natural about the fabric. Its definitely not cotton or even a cotton blend. Ill probably give it away.
"Now...I didn't take them off and feel as if it made my skin glow radiantly or anything....but I wasn't expecting all of that.  They were panties, they were comfy and they served their purpose"
I wear XL and bought that. It's flowy however it's a little too short for my liking. It barely covers my bum and I'm not comfortable wearing it out. With leggings it's really cute and functional but was hoping to have a cooler option for our 100+ days.
Cheaper material
Very comfortable to wear and decent looking fabric.
"the bottom was tight, the top was OK. the arms a little tight but wearable. the skirt, I couldn't even zip it up. I am 5'3 150 lbs and I bought a L."
"I ordered a size 11, and I think I have relatively proportionate feet, so I was surprised these shoes were so narrow.  The calf part fit well, it's made for people with skinny/average calves.  Just needs a wider foot bed option.  Maybe I'll try exchanging for a size up and see if that's any better. The material/quality was pretty good.  Maybe not $50 worth, but since there aren't many options for boots like these in size 11, made with man-made materials, I guess they can charge a little more."
Poor fit for such pricey jeans. I returned them.
"I returned this as it was just too loose and silky for my taste.  If you have a tighter-fitting dress, I would not recommend this as it will move and bunch."
I'm 5'6 and the skirt appeared to be long.  But it was very short I'm the back.  The top was pretty big and mishaped as well so it didn't stay on properly.
"I always wear adidas shoes, this time I forgot that they run big!...  Always order a half size or one size smaller."
"Beautiful sandals, but they were very large. I am usually a 6.5-7, but these were way to big.  Very nicely made, but I had to return them."
"I bought this shirt to use as an easy-access tank for breastfeeding. I'm all about finding shirts with a nice stretch that I can pull down easily to nurse my 8-week old. This tank is small and doesn't have a great stretch. It's pretty tight and I'm petite. I haven't lost all the baby weight, but am about 5 feet, 110lbs and it was tight enough that it gives you armpit side-boob. The cotton seems a bit cheap, not nice and soft like some of the other similar lace tanks I have. It's somewhat see-through, I got the black and would only wear underneath another shirt. It's okay and I'll keep it as it was inexpensive and I'm only using it as an under shirt and at night, again, for easy breastfeeding access. But not likely to buy any more."
"The material is very comfy and I like them alot,, but the pocket, just isn't quite large enough for me. Its probably ok for smaller guys, I'm a medium size American guy, not huge, not small and I can barely fit everything in . If the pocket was just alittle bigger.wider at the bottom, ...... If your a smaller size guy, you'll love them."
"Lovely color and style, and although long enough, the vamp is too narrow. I gave the shoe three stars instead of two because the leather is soft and can be stretched a bit to fit. I have purchased a number of Seychelles shoes and sandals and this is the first time I have run into a problem with the fit."
Great mask but not made to fit girls
"nice watch big numbers easy too read, but band is a plastic was kinda disapointed on that"
interesting dress. the waist is too big but can easily be altered. would be nice for the cooler months.
These are comfortable but a bit old-fashioned looking for my taste.
They shrank after washing  and legs are to tight..
Pretty but wanted thenm bigger.
Not as warm as I thought it's probably a 50 degree or 60 degree jacket if you wear it on its own
I loved the color but had to return them because there was not enough padding in the heel for me.
"The material is a bit lighter weight than I expected, even being labeled light weight. Which means it doesn't quite hang as shown in the photo. I purchased burgundy, and it's lighter in color (a bit more pink) than the photo shows."
"I ordered and received this pair of Skechers Sport Men's Afterburn Memory-Foam Lace-Up Sneakers, for use walking around the neighborhood for some exercise.  I have other pairs, similar, but I wanted a more active use pair of these shoes.  I am older, but quite nimble.  These are those types of tennis shoes that appear to be for older clumpier old folks and I did not want another pair like those, but they are.  I guess when you are old and clumpy you pick out shoes made for you."
These fit super super tight in the legs and calfs.  Ran really small to my husband.
"Bought this for an altar but I would think it unwearable. Received creased but popped it out of the top hat, despite being in an undamadged box."
"Perhaps it's that they're only 2E and not 3E but these shoes are tight in a way that I've never encountered before. They put a lot of pressure on the top of my foot, so much so that I can't wear socks without feeling pain. A shame because they are a good shoe otherwise."
Material is kinda of cheap but at the same time light good to put over a tank top fits according to the size chart
"Nice lenses, and the frames are comfortable, but too thin in my opinion. They don't feel very sturdy, the frames are too light of material, and the prongs that hold the lenses are kind of weak and could be done better. I also wish there were other lenses available to purchase but I haven't been able to find any."
"Ideal if they were somewhat larger, especially for adult male feet that tend to be wider."
"I am usually a medium or size 6 and as the other reviews say it runs small but I still went for the medium. It was too small because my cup size is 34ddd,  grew them naturally which is not a gift as they are more of a pain.

The thing is that if I had gone for the larger size it would not do what it is suppose to do because the medium works well to hold in my tummy a bit but the bust does not fit it is too small. To solve this I extended the straps and pull the bust line just below my breast. This works for me. Thing to consider with purchasing this item is that if you need good support and your shape is not as unbalanced being too heavy on top then going with your true size offers the greater support for holding in the waistline and smoothing out your shape. However, for the well endowed it may be best to go with something else as buying a bigger size defeats the purpose of the item. That's  my take on this."
"Beautiful color, ok shoe, but not the best comfort for my foot. Feels a little hard."
It has a small hole in the arm seam.
Larger and more flared than I expected.
"Comfortable, but not real leather...so...it's fine for the price."
Its much larger than expected
Cute but kinda cheap materials
"The quality is fine.  And maybe it's me, but they took up more room than just packing the whole bag.  I'm not sure I will use them as intended again.  I think i'll store linens and items in my closet."
"It is a really pretty wig, but too thin on the top. And not for anyone who does not look good without bangs."
Cozy and they fell great in my feet.
I like the Quality of The PJs just way to big!
"Fabric was cute and a good weight/quality, but the bust did not have enough room for appropriate coverage. I am 36-26-38 and ordered size Small. I thought the top might be a little tight, but it would not cover any bra I could wear with this dress. You can pull the dress up more, but that pulls up the waistline too. I have a short torso, but still it would not lay correctly worn that way."
I bought this shoe for an every day sport shoe but it is way too tight. I ordered a half size larger as I normally doe for sport shoes but it was not enough as the shoe was too narrow. I donated the shoes to Goodwill.
Nice shoes but stitching on toe of left shoe is a little messed up ..maybe these couldn't get thru QC so I bought rejects at a lower price..Shoes are still wearable .
Very inconsistent sizes. I have some that fit perfectly and this one didn't fit and hurt. All were supposed to be the same size
"cute, needs pockets."
I ordered from another company after wearing this one a couple of times.  It feels 'thin'  and has a tendency to roll down.
"While I can appreciate the utility and hipness of the wallet, it feels like it's designed a bit too young for me. I'm 47 and have used bi-fold wallets most of my life. Long-term habits are hard to change, and one can't downplay the comfort factor when it comes to preference. This is a slim wallet and if not overloaded, it could fit more easily in a front pocket,  but I enjoy the simple form factor of a bi-fold.

That aside, this tri-fold offers good utility. It has a deep money pocket that spans the length of the wallet for bills, and a zippered coin pocket on the outside panel for easy access to change, or keys and other small items you may want to store there.  There are a number of pockets/slots inside -- enough for essential card or IDs. I'm not a fan of the mesh ID pocket for driver's license, but I suppose it works well enough. I also don't care for the zippered billfold pocket. I'm not sure I see the need for it personally, and it adds to the time required to access essentials. However, if you want a zipper to secure your bills, this wallet has one. The Velcro is effective and works well, and the polyester used to construct the Billabong Young Mens Classic Tri-Fold Wallet feels like it will last. The stitching could be more refined, but for a billfold at this price point, you get a lot for the money. It works better for a front pocket rather than the back.

"The size 9s were way too big, ordered size 8 - they were just right."
a bit small but stylish
"The shoes seem fine, but going by sizing guide they are too large.  Especially considering you need to have them start out fitting very tight because they will stretch.  I don't know any dancers who like their shoes to fit loose & sloppy.  You want them to fit like a second skin to your feet.  While your toes need to be able to spread, you don't want your  feet sliding or slipping inside of the shoe.
Will need to return and order a smaller size.  I ordered 7 1/2 and I wear a size 8 to 8 1/2 size street shoe, but it is hard to compare that to dance shoes.  Dance shoes need to fit different than street shoes.  Also, the lining inside one of the shoes was all bent up & would have been uncomfortable to wear.  I hope the next pair will not have the lining rolling up."
"If you're dressing up as a pioneer, this is fantastic!  It didn't work out for me, but I'm sure it'll work out for someone who's looking for it."
Nice to look at but poorly made. Sleeves are too short and I'm small.
"Fabric too shiny; will probably return.  Color is nice, just too flashy with shine."
very cute but was not the right fit for me
"Very cute,but kinda cheap looking in person."
"I ordered a large and there's no way that the sizing on the leggings match the sizing chart. But i donated them, so someone will find good use."
Cute but way too small!  I had to return it.
Mother in law loves them but not as shine as it looks
looks nice but runs small
Like these much.  I have been wearing them for years. They also have pockets instead of a piece of cloth sewed onto the outside.  I also like the adjustable fit since I am a big guy plus there is enough material in the crotch to keep from restricting things.  I previously rated these much higher but that was based on prior purchases.  They now fit just like wranglers-too short in the body so if you have purchased these a couple years ago-order a size bigger.
Not the best Quality
"Purchased these for my niece.  She is an average 4-year-old.  The bottoms fit fine, but the top was small.  She will not get a full winter's' wear out of the top."
I love these shoes but they are almost too wide.  They were such a good deal. I kept them anyway. I manage ;-).
First time I wore them they ripped in the seam. So cut them off and made capri.
"I received a brightly polished ring instead of the brushed ring.
It fits well and is very comfortable, and looks attractive, but I wanted the brushed, because I think it will be easier to maintain.
I completed forms on Amazon to return with replacement, but it was indicated that no replacement was available.
I have not heard from Amazon, nor have I received an email response, nor a refund.
This is not my experience with Amazon.
They are usually better at customer service.  Whats up with that ?

Later the same day ... I just re ordered the ring with the brushed center.
Amazon responded and sent me a shipping label.
Amazon sent me an email stating that the ring I just ordered as a replacement has been shipped.
That's the customer service for which Amazon is well reputed."
"It was packaged poorly.  The sides were crinkled up like wings and they should have been laying flat. The issue is only with the right side shoe. They look ridiculous like this.  I LOVE the boots, but I can't wear them like this"
"These leggings seem to run small.  The design is super cute and they are quite stretchy, but I'm concerned the 6-12 month size won't fit my 3.5 month old for nearly long enough.  The length is good, but for our 90th percentile baby the waistband looks like it will be quite snug in just a couple months.  I'm also hoping the fabric gets softer in the wash, but right now it's quite rough after only 3 washes.  The inside feels softer than the outside, however, so I'm not worried about scratchy material against my babies legs."
not sewn right and customer service is slow but a cute corset.
Pretty ring but doesn't look real. Kind of large center stone.
"ummmm, everyone is right...WAYYYYYYY TOOOOOOOOO BIGGGGGGGGG!!!! 3 stars for made in usa though...hey rainbow, copy drifter usa but make it this price!"
"Well made and size is correct but cotton material is unusually thin.  Other brands, even cheaper brands, use thicker material.  I am afraid that the product will wear out quickly."
"Okay, good for like 3-4 days"
These are cute but seemed to have stretched out over time
"Right boot, the inside around little toe, not enough fur lining or cushion. Wearing thin socks because my feet would get too hot, my right little toe around the outer side of it, my toe got so sore, it effected my walking properly, & really hurt to walk."
"Stiff fabric, not really comfortable.  Didn't get much softer after several washes."
ok but not impressed.. need a smaller size than their small
Very cute. Don't recommend for big breasted woman. Cups are made small.
Does not work very well on canvas i.e. Converse.
"Previously ordered same product and loved them but size and design has changed a bit. Still like the hard to get ""white""  but disappointed in new fit."
Husband and son wear these socks.. Only problem is they seem to get holes pretty quickly. I think it's the cotton they use which is cheap. They sell this brand at Costco also.
"I was trying to match some of the underwear I already own. The picture doesn't really match what I received.

Maybe the order got screwed up but what I got was more of a boxer brief. Also, the ""Calvin Klein"" stitching looks a little rough, almost like a knock off. Not worth returning but still..."
The shoes were a little tight across and the seam pressed into the side of my foot. The heels hit below where my last Dansko did and rubbed a blister. They are leather and will stretch out a little and are getting more comfortable each time I wear them.
"Fit exactly how I wanted for the athletic cut.  My quads and calves are very muscular so it's hard to find jeans that are comfy.  These are.  The reason I'm only giving 3 stars is after one wash, the inside lining broke off.  I love the ripped fray look, but I was slightly disappointed after one wash."
Kinda baggy on me but still looks nice.
"I like the thin material, but this isn't slouchy.  It's also doubled up--so it's like two hats sewn together at the top, but folded at the bottom.  This works well for under a bike or football helmet, but you're not gonna look rasta wearing this unless you have a very small head.  That being said, I have a large head.  I wear 7 3/4"" fitted hats."
"I bought this bag specifically for flying with Spirit and United. So far I just got it and the quality seems pretty cheap, but you get what you pay for. It fits a couple days worth of items not a problem. Just be careful with how much you stuff in it."
"Bigger than expected. Came in good condition. Lenses are not polorazide, just colored to appear to be. I'm disappointed, but they serve a purpose, and because I'm so hard on glasses I always try different cheap brands. These are ok, but i won't buy again."
"These jeans have a similar fit and feel to Old Navy carpenter jeans, except they are stretchy. The legs are straight, but wide like carpenter jeans, and the waist on my size 36 was sized correctly, and a bit stretchy too. The thing I didn't like was the length. The 36W all come in 33.75L however mine fit more like a 36L. I usually wear a 32L and they come down to the floor, these were 4 longer, I measured. I also noticed they're a bit pricey. The thin lightweight denim may not hold up as well as Levis, however like I said, they feel like Old Navy; and for me those hold up for years. I don't usually wear stretchy cloths, but at ;least they aren't skinny jeans."
"These earrings are very well made but the screw backs are horrible.  I had to use the backs of different earrings to wear.  I bought 3 sets in different sizes as my ears have 3 piercings.  The earrings are very nice and can be worn for either casual or fancy occasions and look good.  But the Screw Backs need a redesign.
If not for the screw backs, I would have given a 5 star review"
Color not is not like New Black.  It looks old.
"Size fitted as expected but the description says the heal is 3.5 inches which is incorrect, these are at least 4 inches. If the heal had been the size as indicated I'd have given 4 stars instead of 3."
"Good quality boot but the toe was a little more rounded than what I want and the quality is ok too, I guess for the price its fine but I feel like you could do better. Anyways, in person i felt like the toe end was too rounded so I returned the shoe, but other wise if that style suits you then you should give them a try for sure."
"The shoes are very comfortable despite they are a little large, very soft and the line is very representative of the brand. If you select these shoes, you have to be careful with the real measure of your feet because of the shape it have. For instance, in another brand, size 9 medium fit me well but these are quite big. I would like to change it for another smaller ones."
"The shoes are comfy, bit I am already seeing the strips of decoration coming unraveled. They are less expensive than the other shoes that are very similar to them. The shoes are also way more comfortable."
"If you like bright, sparkly jewelry and larger crystals then you will likely appreciate this set. I have reviewed a lot of jewelry and this set just didn't ""wow"" me. The packaging is and looks VERY cheap so I think that is where it lost some of the appeal. Looks like something from a cheap jewelry shop in a mall.

Let's get down to some details.
The necklace chain is approximately 15 1/2"" with the multi-faceted crystal measuring in at 1 1/8"" x 5/8"". The stud earrings are approximately 1 3/8"" long with the crystals being 5/8"" x 3/8"".

Would I purchase this for myself? No! Will it appeal to many? In all honesty, yes, as for those who enjoy wearing matching fashion jewelry, this could well be just what they are looking for. Product provided in exchange for an honest review. Thanks, Liz"
Nice but a bit smaller than I expected.
"I gave this 3 stars because although I thought it was a very attractive bra, it runs small. I normally take a 38 B and have for years. I have several other styles of Maidenform and all fit great, however this one is very tight around. Fits more like a 36 B.  Had to send it back."
great waterproof / winter boots extremely comfortable but in fall and my feet are sweating
"Light and comfortable but leather looks cheap and shiny, looks more like imitation leather, plastic."
Had to return it. Seems almost impossible to buy shoes on line that fit perfectly.  Trial and error works in the store.
The strap on the bottom flips over on itself a lot. I'm hoping it's just a bit too small for me and it'll fit better as I continue going to the gym.
The fabric is cute but the fit is a bit large in the chest. I'm 5 feet tall and pretty well endowed but you can still kind of see the pink lining inside when it's on. It doesn't have any pockets which is kind of a bummer but the material is comfy and stretchy.
"Its clear that this dress was made for a thin, fit muscle-less person. While the blue was nice, it also felt cheaply made (some threads came loose at the wrists upon first wash). It's wearable for a some-what chubby person (or someone who just has a rounder stomach) but it loosk best with a long vest or something over it."
"When I took this watch out of the very impressive looking and feeling box I thought for sure they'd sent me the men's version of the watch by accident. When I realized that there was no mistake, I had to laugh. This thing is in no way feminine. It is huge and heavy. I'm not sure it could be any heavier and not be considered a hand weight. The diameter of the band is crazy too - it was loose on my husband's wrist - I can't even keep it from falling off my arm, which is fine I suppose because you should be able to take off the links to fit it, but I don't have a tool small enough to do that. I can't send it back, so I will have to take it to a jeweler if I am to wear it.
I also wanted to like the face, but I found it once again, very manly and ugly. There are very tiny squares to mark the hours with a matching very tiny square with a shiny diamond-type element, but not shiny enough or big enough to look beautiful.  The magnified date makes the black lettering stand out which doesn't match any other part of the watch and made me feel like I was elderly the way it was magnified so large.
That said, it was easy to set the time, the way the hands move is precise and elegant and the gold looks like a quality finish. My problem with the watch is all about style, not about function.
I included a picture of the watch I generally wear on my wrist next to this one, just to give you some idea of my expectation - that I was just getting the gold version of my silver watch. Hopefully it will help you as you decide whether this heavy timepiece is your sort of thing."
"I went by the size chart, but this was enormous on me - ridiculously so.  The bust was loose and the length was long enough to wear it as a dress.  Also, I don't like the fact that it clings to the waistband of my leggings, creating an unattractive bulge.  The color is very pretty, though."
"They are good but was hoping for better.  I normally wear 11.5 to 12.5 depending on the brand so I bought 11.5 and these are a little tight on the width.  I don't have a particularly wide foot or a skinny foot just average width I would guess.  The length fit just fine.

I suppose they are better than any of the cheaper boots but if you are looking to wear these boots all day around town I say keep looking.  They are not very comfortable but then again they are rain boots and they do their basic job.  I use them to do my lawn since I live in the wet northwest and it is convenient to slip them off/on.

Pros -
They keep your feet clean & Dry
They look pretty good
Made with good material (no cracking, weird smells or stiff)
Slip on/off without lacing (You did know it's a rain boot right?).
Seem to have good traction.

Cons -
Not very comfortable for wearing for hours
They run a little narrow for regular feet
No support at all
Can't wear it with thick socks (unless you want your foot to feel like its on a press) which might be a bad thing for those people with snow.
The white part stains easily (if you care about this - I don't but it might be a negative to some)."
"It's nice but... it was unclear what material I was getting. The wallet is small, minimal, and nice. But as someone who wants to buy cruelty-free products, I was disappointed to find that the card this came with claimed it is made of leather. The description of the wallet says it features ""Premium Thin Leather PU Canvas and precision oiled edges"". I googled PU Leather and found it was synthetic/artificial leather, not the genuine thing - however, it can sometimes contain leather. So I checked the other version and it features ""Premium Thin Canvas and precision oiled edges"". I also checked the more detailed description of the wallet I ordered and it says, ""It is constructed using only one piece Premium Canvas with a nylon lining."" The description saying the wallet is made of canvas and nylon gave me the impression that it was not made from animal products. So while it's nice, I definitely would not buy it again."
Material too thin! Almost see thru!
"I loved the design on these shoes, but unfortunately it fit too big. I always buy pumps size 8.5 or even 9 (to have a little wiggle room when I walk in them all day), but the buckle on this shoe was way too long and not adjustable, so it just hung outside the shoe, making it look quite unflattering. I thought about trying returning it and getting another pair half a size smaller, but the shipping takes way too long (it took 3 weeks to arrive after I ordered them) and I needed shoes much sooner."
"A cheap alternative to expensive ( but really professional) watches.
For 90 bucks a good deal I guess:)"
"Necklace is cute, however, I would like it better if it were on a 16"" chain.  I cannot seem to remove the bow to put on a shorter change.  It gets stuck around headphones while working out because it is just a little bit longer.  Otherwise, it is a small, cute bow."
"Liked the shoe, not the fit. The length was too short and a bit too narrow."
Cute top but pricey for fabric quality.  Also sizing always seems to be a gamble depending on the piece.
Shrunk after one wash even in cold water.
I normally wear a medium in bottoms but shorts fit perfectly though I ordered an x large. The top was like an extra small.
Nice coat but thin and for someone who is very fit and thin.
"fits great, however it wrinkles very easy and can show through the shirt. the padding is also very thick"
Runs on the small side.
the material is 100%polyester-it's very warm when not in the water and the XL fits like a large-I wasn't impressed-it feels like I'm wearing a trash bag:(
i love them . they are really pretty. butt take sooo long .to get them tho.
quality not great
I bought the wide shoe and my daughter still can't wear them well because the strap is too short.
"I love the look of this skirt, however, the tulle underlay felt like window screening.  It was uncomfortable to wear and the top layers actually stuck to it when you move.  I cut the underlay out and the skirt worked much better."
"Even though I ordered these shoes 1/2 size larger than I usually wear, they are very narrow and barely cover the toes.  I feel they would be very difficult to walk safely in.  Hope this helps your decision."
"It looks so much better online. I haven't completely felt like I like it a lot. Especially after I saw the material and the strands that was coming out of the top. It fits fine. I got a large because my hips are big but my breast are small.  As far as shipping go,  I ordered this March 31st and I got it today, April 11th."
To small need a xl
Full size bigger than other shoes I have of the same size.
"Good for the price. Nothing special.

 I always prefer Joe Snyder."
Nothing special.  You get what you pay for...and these were not pricey!
"I am 5.6, 120, got an xsmall.  It was huge and baggy.  Had to send back."
"love the vibrant color, yet sad that it is too small."
"The way the point is in the front of the shoe, really turned me off. Other than than that it's a nice shoe. Nice fabric, appears durable. Nice height, just to much of a narrow point in the front"
not sure if I will keep them.  I find them a bit heavy for me.  Certainly great for walking in woods and hikes/trails.  I need for dog walking.
I'd like it to be a little longer
"Love the color, but this tee runs a bit small.  I wear a 38DD and the XL is tight across my shoulders.  The material is great, and I will keep it, as it can be a hassle to return.  I will wear it around the house, but not to the gym!"
Cute clips not that strong
"The watch is beautiful, and fit my smaller than average wrist.  I gave it 3 star instead of 5 because the battery died the first week I got it.  It was frustrating. I replaced the batteries and now it is working just fine."
nice shoes but ran small.  the other problem I had was with the shoe staying tight.  I had to adjust the tightness every 10 minutes or so during a recent hike.  I like the style of the shoe but will need to put in a normal shoe string and hope that the shoe stretches.
"These run quite large, I must wear socks to keep them on.  Also they come too high up on the top of my foot."
"Like the overall look of the bag.  However, the bag was heavy to me.  The leather didn't smell too good after opening the box."
Under whelmed for the price. One piece and not two
"These look really cool and I love and have a million Diesel products so I thought they would be great for the beach or hot days, etc. However, they are really very small, in fact uncomfortably so and I don't think I will even end up wearing them around the house as slippers. I actually wear Adidas Adilette as slippers presently and not only do they provide a significantly increased amount of support, but the footprint of the shoe is much larger and lends to a more comfortable fit. Not only do these feature a very small footprint whereby your foot ends up sliding off the front of the sandles resulting in that disgusting trash look of those who are wearing slides that are 10 years old and too small, but even the strap part across the top that goes over your foot is quite small, lending the whole shoe an overall disposable type appearance which is super sad considering the heritage of the brand."
The dress was too small. I will return it and try to get the large size
Well I really love these shoes in theory. They're so comfy and light but I have very short toes and the front of these shoes just looks like a duck bill and they're way too long. If you have wide feet or short toes then these are not for you. Order a half size small. I'm disappointed they don't fit me well.
Does not cause rashes and comfortable.
Too short for my 9 year olds.  It is above her ankles
nice but the posts are short and feel  flimsy
This shirt just like this brand runs very small! I know these are supposed to be fitted but my 6mo fits into 18 months size - granted it is a little loose but not by much!  As other reviewers have stated it is very very short - and rides up a bit. It is dissapointing but we had to keep this until I can find another one. The quality is nice. The pics below show shirt on my son and compared to a burts bees size 18 month shirt.
"I was looking for 100% cotton sweatpants. These are cut like sweatpants but are disappointingly thin, not the same weight and feel as traditional sweats."
Get a size at least one smaller than you are.  I got a large and needed a medium without a doubt.  The quality and style are good.  Mine became one of my models dress with a belt for a fabulous look
Little small in size but it works
"three stars because it is made with cheap materials, but it looks great. I used it for a Dallas Cowgirl costume. It was comfortable and wide which is perfect because I have bunions. I wouldn't use it for anything other than my costume."
"this is LARGE for a newborn .... more for a 6-9 month old,  would have loved for it to have been newborn as I thought as it is adorable"
Cute shirt but in the photo it's a normal looking tee. When received I noticed its a crop top. I guess i'm wearing a tank underneath...
"Cute, but looks like costume jewelry if that is the look you are going for."
Cute Dress but when I put it on it looked more blah then how it looks in the picture. Definitely not for anyone who is curvy as it doesn't lay right. I love their short midi dresses and was hoping this would work but had no luck.
"The quality of the veil itself was really surprising!

Very soft lace, very elegant, and just as pictured. The veil didn't need any steaming or ironing and looked beautiful after just being hung for a few hours.

My biggest complaint was the comb. The comb is metal as advertised, but the teeth don't come to a point that grip in your hair, instead they are bent pieces of wire that are rounded on the bottom. Because they are rounded, they seem to slip out of hair MUCH easier than a comb with pointed teeth, and even a plastic comb with pointed teeth would have been preferable. Additionally, the comb teeth were bent in awkward angles and the comp came totally flat, not curved to hug your head like most do,

That said, it's a small price price to pay compared to what the cost of a veil at a bridal store runs. I still would totally suggest purchasing this, just perhaps looks at buying a separate comb and prepare to replace it. Even then you will come out ahead and it really is a beautiful veil!"
Ordered one size up based on other reviews. The sleeves are too long and loose on me but the fit on the chest and waist was good though.
bust area slightly small
This is a small XL
clasp was really cheap looking and not sturdy.
Very pretty shoe but run very small no size up so we will have to stretch them
"I love the way the watch looks and feel, but it was not built to last.  The indicators mark did come loose inside the watch. I sent it to Skagen to get it repaired for $30."
"Not the best quality, but it's cute."
"All I have are Roxy flip-flops, some just come in the same size, but fit smaller.  These were one of them.  Great sandal, but way to narrow!"
These are my seventh pair of Danskos. Theyre just adorable! Its the color that makes them modern funky.  The length is fine but I have a thinner foot so Im going to have to add a shoe insert to the foot bed to fill up the space otherwise the arch side of the shoe is far too high and cuts into my ankle. I have wanted these shoes for a long time and I didn't expect to have to do that. Otherwise these would be a 5.
"This was really pretty and I tried very hard to make it work, but the small fit more like a medium or large, and it was just too awkward a fit to make it work. I passed it on to my mother who is very happy with it. It seems to be good quality, just the size is off."
"I wanted to love these.  I gave them three stars only because they are so pretty.  I can buy a size 8 in any show and they always fit like a glove.  These are at least 1 full size too small, maybe more.  I wore then for about fifteen minutes before my feet started to tingle.  The description says they are leather but they are not.  I'll be passing on to my sister who wears a 7."
"Not a bad product to purchase. I brought this for my 16 year old cousin and she loved it. I kept the smaller bag for my cards and change and to this day in 2017 its still in perfect condition. No pieces have fell off and color still looks fine. Three pieces for that price, was a steal. I would defiantly suggest this product for a gift, especially for someone younger or anyone who isn't so concerned with name brands."
this costume should not say fits 4T. my son is 4T and I could barely get it on him. returned it immediately.
"size not comparable to other shoes this size..A shame because we wanted these on Christmas. They are adorable!
I don't have more to say."
Too big and the material is not comfortable at all. Looks cute but not comfortable enough to sleep in.
"It was to big all oround, is a nice boot but is not made for me"
"Okay. Mouth opening is just awkward. If I didn't have to constantly adjust that hole then I would have rated higher,"
"I loved the color and material. Very nice looking pants, but I bought my original size which is large and I couldn't get them over my rear. They run really small. I gave them to my daughter who is 5 '4 and weights about 110 and they fit her perfect. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. Too bad they don't come in a 2xl."
After wearing them for about an hour they start to ride up and it is not very comfortable.
This is cute but it runs a little big and the sparkles falls off very easily. Spend a little more and order from Disney.
way smaller than expected.
"These shirts are soft & look nice, but have shrunk quite a bit after the first time they were washed."
"I mean, I love these boots, but I bought a size 7 thinking these were for women. It came in and I was super prepared to send them back but amazingly they fit!! So they are either really womens boots or they run severely small!!  So thats why I took off two stars. Otherwise the quality is really nice. Looking forward to wearing them this winter!!"
"The fabric's not that comfortable.

They're a bit ugly. They look significantly better in the Amazon pic than they do in real life.

The shape isn't that great - the lower butt part is pretty high so it doesn't cover my whole butt. The pouch doesn't seem more useful than the regular opening other underwear have."
I'm not as impressed with this short as I have been with many of the others by U.S. Polo. This shirt is a layered This one just doesn't seem as well made as the other shirts I have reviewed. It fit well and washed well. I was afraid the dark part would beeld onto the white faux t-shirt parts but it didn't.
"With the title of the product saying ""Tall"" I assumed the product I would be purchasing for my 6'4"" boyfriend would be tall. Wrong. The 2x shirt I ordered him fits his shoulders and arms but barely grazes the top of his jeans. He's the type that likes to lift his arms above his head and not have his belly button on display. The fabric is quite soft though and seems to be very breathable so if it had been long enough it would have great for my warm-hearted oven of a guy :-)"
isn't really high waisted
"I like the shoes but there is a lot of dye that leaks onto your foot, even after wiping them."
Hope I can shrink them a little my thighs I do not think are small but not big either and have never had a hard time with thigh high stockings staying up so this was a first.
I ended up pulling out the inside lining. It's okay. Durable and well made. Just a bit Small in the sizing.
"Material is silky, they fit great, but the elastic waistband doesn't hold it's shape once it has been put in the laundry which leaves weird looking waistline."
"Runs very large . Usually wear l-xl got xl so still would fit after washing , haven't washed yet but probably be too big still fits like xxl"
It fits slightly tighter than advertised. It did  loosen up as I broke in the running shoe.  I didn't have that problem with  prior ASICS running shoes.
Looking high and low for a beanie that doesn't have to be folded over it says 8inches but I believe it's a little larger it's a wee bit slouchy
"I sure do wish I had read the reviews before I bought these sandals.  I wear a 7W.  I couldn't even get my feet in them...let alone wear them.  I love the look of them, & would love to get a larger size, but they're sold out in black.  LESSON learned...read reviews before buying!"
It slides off your head and doesn't have a strap to keep it in place. The one I received was a bit squished.
Cute shoe unable to zip and the heel tips are beige and was already twisted
Much smaller then appears.... Pretty and made well though
Had to add elastic on the sides.
Makes long dance section comfortable .
Thought these were supposed to be newborn socks.. they are the size of toddler socks!
It's cheaply made but cheaply priced so it's fine... It does the job for what it's for... It's good for the beach toys but I wouldn't load it up with anything else that's really heavy... good size though and convenient and nice colors
really cute just too small
Very well made but they are small for a 34.  Pockets a little tight too.  Otherwise they seem fine. :)
"These shoes are very comfy, soft, and warm... as long as I am sitting.

The bottoms of these shoes are very narrow so my feet (especially my heels) kind of slide to the outside of the shoe when I'm walking.  This is not too much of an issue because I plan on using these as only house slippers, but I think this sliding effect would be annoying if I were to do a lot of walking in these."
"I got the top that when you choose which top to buy it is the 1st and 3rd one.  First off, it is not stretch material,  it seems to be leftover t-shirt material (two pieces sewn together to be exact.  The finish is not that great, and since it is one long intwined string that also does not stretch, this could be problematic.b  The shirt goes down to mid-back, but comes up in the front to where it barely covers the ladies.  I bought a large and am a bra size 36b.  I bought this to wear under backless shirts for summer since I think it is tacky to be able to see a bra under strappy shirts.  I would never wear this one for a workout since when I raise my arms, you can see underboob!!!  Again that was for the style of the girl who has on the ballerina slippers.

****I did also buy the last two bras in the series of pictures, the ones that are the one size and they had more stretch, better material and more support!!!  Those were also less expensive!!!****"
"The concept of how the trees work is good, however the boot trees keep falling apart.  Not made well."
"This shampoo is a thick and rich looking green. It doesn't smell at all like Eucalyptus, which was what I was expecting from the description, but the scent is pleasant and not too strong. The shampoo works fine--it leaves my hair soft and clean but there is nothing really out of the ordinary about it."
Pointy toe gets uncomfortable.  Beautiful shoe though
Keeps good time - so does their $15 watch.  It seems to be much more complicated than it needs to be considering the functions.  I didn't notice it has no second had or I would not have bought it.
"I have a pair of medium blue ""Samantha""  style size 4 bootcut jeans in my closet that I bought a while ago. Since then, I've lost about 5 pounds and the jeans themselves have simultaneously gotten a bit stretched out simply due to regular washing and wearing. And while I still do wear them occasionally, they're definitely more ""baggy and slouchy"" than ""fitted and flattering"" at this point. So when I saw the ""licorice"" (black) color ""Samantha"" jeans in a size 2 at a crazy-low price, I was so excited - and certain they'd fit - that I immediately bought 2 pairs.

Unfortunately, it seems either that Miraclebody has changed their jeans sizing entirely OR the ""licorice"" jeans were inexplicably cut larger than other colors in the ""Samantha"" style - because both size 2's I received are at least the same size as, and seemingly even slightly larger than, my older stretched-out size 4 pair!

Given that these new jeans were (or should have been) essentially the same jeans as the ones I already had and loved, it was a real disappointment. Regardless, I'm hoping those particular jeans were just a fluke manufacturing or labeling error (which might explain why they were being offered at such an unusually low price). The Miraclebody brand doesn't seem to be as widely available as it was a couple of years ago so I don't have any recent purchases for a size comparison, but I'm very tempted to spring for a pair in the ""Pacifica"" color and cross my fingers that they fit as expected. If so, I'll be back to update this review accordingly..."
"It is a nice looking polo shirt, very form fitting and looks great if you have a slimmer or athletic build like the model in the picture. However, the material is not very durable and after a year of light use one of the buttons has already fallen off on the gray one I had bought along with this one. I can still wear the polo because it looks fine even with a missing top button, but I'm pretty sure that if I had worn this polo more regularly I would have gotten rid of it by now due to wear."
I like them but I don't know if I'm just hard on glasses or what but they already have a huge scratch on them.
They are a little large for me. I wear size 6 shoes. The heel part is also a little high so that the socks show when I wear them shoes. The quality of the socks is acceptable but not excellent.
"There are some things I love about these, but also some things that I'm experiencing as I start to wear them that I think are good to pass along.  So today is the first day I have worn these.  I really like that they cover my foot and weren't slipping all day.  I have a wider width foot, and previous brands of this type of liner I bought were always slipping or pulling off of the heel.  This does have a gel type lining on the inside of the heel that probably helps keep it into place, but I also think that they elastic around the opening matters as well.  It tends to fit a bit snug.

As another reviewer has noted, these are going to be very visible in your flats.  So if that bothers you, then perhaps keep looking.  For me, I just really don't like the feel of sweaty feet in my flats, so I'm not about to go barefoot in any closed toed dress shoe really.  Not to mention, experience tells me that leads to stinky feet and stinky shoes, neither of which I enjoy.  So I place a higher priority on these staying on my feet then being invisible. And honestly, one of the amazing blessings that's come to me as the mom of a special needs kiddo is that I no longer care what people think about how I look in my clothes.  Standing in a dance studio waiting to pick your daughter up covered in puke will surely do that to you, among other things.  So I'm not really bothered by that so much, so it's an FYI for you.

The reason I took stars off is that after one day of wearing these, there is already considerable wear visible to the areas contacted by the shoes shown in picture one.  Those shoes, by the way, are wide width, and they are not in any way, shape, or form snug across the top of my foot.  My life needs shoes that I can walk, stand, etc. comfortably in all day long.  The fabric is pilled up, thinned out, and showing signs of distress in those areas.  The top side of the pilling is shown in picture two.  Also, in case you are sensitive to such things, note the pinkish red line where the sock has shifted as I moved my foot to take the picture.  These things grip enough to leave a mark, indent and color wise.  So again, if that's something that bothers you, it's something to be aware of.  It didn't really cause me any issues where I noticed it during the day, but someone with sensory issues or skin sensitivities might.

So while I love that I didn't spend all day pulling these up, they are showing enough signs of distress to indicate they are not going to be so durable.  So it's probably a good thing I won't be wearing flats too much in the summer months..."
"I fell in love with these boots. But unfortunately, I had to return them. They were listed as wide calf boot, and they are not.  There was no zipper and the width did not meet wide calf standards. Its a great looking though."
"I read so many comments about the sandals being too tight, even when people claimed to have narrow feet, well I would say they fit just right. I order 6.5, I wear between 6/6.5 but the straps were a little loose. Not the most comfortable shoes, but I manage to stay on them for about four hours, most of the time walking and holding a baby. After my feet were killing me (no blisters) and I had to (really had to) remove them. Overall good. I expected less from the reviews"
They aren't built for comfort but they are waterproof and wind proof. They do what you want them to do.
It's an OK hat kinda small tho.
Very small and dainty but it is truly unique I love it!
"They are true to size (I wear an 8 and got an 8, but I have normal sized legs and feet)but they are difficult to drive in. They are not very flexible and I don't think I would ever try to drive in them again. Also when I walk the rim on the top hurts the back of my legs."
"My sons both love Thomas, so it seems inevitable that we'd own a Thomas costume.  This is not anything special, but it is cheap and easy.  It is a little bit big on my smallish two-year-old, but he loves it.  With a little fussing it will be fine for Halloween.  In that past we've bought Melissa and Doug dress-up clothes (so we can use them again and again, and we really do!)for Halloween costumes or my mother has bought them Potty Barn Kids costumes (which are just waaay too expensive for one day...).  This costume is certainly not in the same quality range as those items, but this costume is a fraction of the price of those brands.  With that all said, you can buy this exact same item at Walmart for $9.88 or order it online from their website and pay $.98 shipping.  SO...if you want a cheap, easy Thomas costume, buy this...at Walmart."
"I bought this for my son to wear on his kilt/sporran chain to church and it's fine. I ditched the crappy key ring but the loop is so small it was hard to do much more than tie it to the sporran. The cross is fine, but it's a bear to put back on if it comes off."
These shoes are smaller in size than traditional Crocs in length and width
Cheap quality but it can be used.
Would have given them more stars but i have been losing buttons
"No problems yet, had to tighten screws to keep band from falling off"
"CAN NOT BE ADJUST
FEEL KIND OF LOOSE
NOT SUPPORTIVE
FEEL SOME HOW COMFORTABLE
ITS A PAIN TO GET THE BRACKET TO CLOSE I GUESS"
"beautiful shoe fits tight, very classy but uncomfortable. Spent most of the day at my desk with my shoes kicked off"
O.K. for the price.
Great looking show just runs narrow.
The front part of the bodice doesnt look at all like the pic and it is a bit snug in the tummy
Slick shades. I like the springy hinges but they are a little loose
"Looks good, feels decent, but they're too tight in the toes. They felt like steel toe boots to me"
"Like the shirt, but the sizing definitely runs large. I have returned it for an exchange."
I love the way these look and feel but they really run small and narrow. I wear an 8 and got a 9 because I tried and 8 in the store and decided to order a size bigger to be honest I don't see a difference in the 8 and the 9 my foot fits with nothing left over on the sides or back.
"I got these shoes in a timely matter.  But I have decided to exchange
them for an even bigger size.  My shoe size is 9 1/2 at least I would
say 95% of the time.  I bought these in a 10 and they are very tight
on my feet!  I never wore these shoes outside, but I can tell in 10's
they are just very tight.  I do really need some rain shoes though,
so I will exchange them for a size 11."
"Those are really tight around the ankles and my toddler is not even plump. I don't want shoes to interfere with his blood circulation, so I am returning them."
"The belt was a gift for my mom. The color is excellent, as described.
The construction is sturdy, (stitching intact), however, my mom feels that the quality of the belt itself is rather cheap.

My mother wears a size M and the amount of belt left is about 3-5 inches. Enough to pull the remainder of the belt through the first loop on the jeans.

Hope this review helps you with your purchasing descisions :)"
The shirt is decent however grossly misrepresented. It is not 100% as indicated on the tag. It is more of a rayon/spandex blend. There may be some cotton but not much. Definitely not 100%. I took a risk purchasing because photo was stolen from Free People. It's from their We the Free line and the name of it is Drippy Dress. For the price it's ok but seller should adjust description and tag to indicate proper material. Also there is a seam down the entire front of the shirt. It's kind of awkward looking. Color is way off too.
Cute but too narrow. Seemed to be more narrow than any other Sanuks I've had. Had to send back.
It is comfy but gets wrinkled easily.
"These are heavy, nice sweatpants, but seem to run a little smaller than other's I have.  I wear a 10/12 and I bought the large and after washing them they seem too tight..."
"short sleeves somewhat larges. At the picture, I couldn`t perceive that. Maybe you can fix the model of the blouse or make the picture more big, for people appreciate better"
"I end up drenched after my workout.  Found a Saucony shirt that is much better even though it's not a tank.  I don't even wear this Champion anymore, just sits in my closet."
"I buy stuff based on reviews so I try to be really honest. Love the look- and I usually live in heels- but these were the most uncomfortable shoes ever!!
Felt like walking on concrete! Not to mention there is not enough lacing to loosen the shoes. That would have made a big difference but I had to keep them laced pretty tightly just so the laced would reach the top- but it meant I could hardly bend my knees. I went to a dinner and couldn't sit the whole time because I couldn't bend my knees!! Ugh"
"Super disappointed. This bowtie is for my son, for my wedding and in the picture it matches our colors perfectly, but when I received it, it's more of a light mint. Great bowtie, just feel a bit let down by false advertising on the color."
"Material, cut, color and design is good.. But the XXL I got for my partner was way too big!! Definitely go down a size..."
"These fit slightly big, I am a TTS 6.5 and probably could have got away with a 6. These are cute boots but I dislike how the back of the heel sticks out, it looks funny. I'm only 5'3"" and these weren't too tall, the shaft height it perfect. I didn't even mind that weren't real suede and were kind of cheap looking. Unfortunately I cannot wear them anymore because they FALL DOWN! I wore them twice with no problem and got tons of complements but now they fall down to my knees. They stretch out very easily and now I cannot even wear them because they don't stay up! They look quite funny all bunched up in the leg."
The nude color is more of a brown color. Its fits okay but I have yet to go out with them
I like the flap over the cleavage.  Fits really snug but it works.
Love keens.  Wear a 9.5 wide.  Ordered a 10 which usually covers it.  No luck here.  Too wide and too narrow.  Returned the 10's for a 10.5.  Let's see how those fit.
Size runs small.  Cute shirt though.
Pretty dress runs small.  Guess I will lose some weight because I plan to wear it!
"I wore these around the house for a few days before wearing them for walking, and I thought they were amazing, and looked good.  But once I wore them for walking (walked about 10 city blocks, wore them at office, then 10 more city blocks), the thong hurt as soon as I was walking on the street, really bad.  By the time I got home, they were brutal, and my feet hurt horribly.  I guess these would still be fine for wearing just to the market, or to do a few errands, if you are driving, but they might not be good if you have to walk more than a block because of the thong between the toes.  I never had a problem with the thong style before, so I'm pretty disappointed, and pretty annoyed because I probably can't return them now.  You might want to get some Birkis that don't have the thong. :)"
Initially I loved this but the charms are heavy & irritating when typing. The cz's have mostly fallen out as well. :(
"1st off I did 20yrs Active Federal service in U.S. Army , Abn, Rngr , SF ! Came in in 1979. This jacket is not as pictured the breast pockets are about 1/2 the size shown , the material is not the spec (spec was 50/50 nylon cotton). The whole jacket is ok but there is something about it that just isn't right, it just shouts knockoff , it is an ok jacket or marginal but definitely not Mil Spec. It will probably do the job but it is not quite right !

Update , just went and looked at it again , definitley not worth the money , this really is cheap all the way around , even the liner is cheap , the buttons and snaps are .....cheap this looks like they were getting charged by the fabric milimeter so they cut corners everywhere and skimped on cloth the collar looks as though they just didn't want to give it the amount of material it needed to lay flat , so it doesn't . Not even worth the touble to send back but I will. Disappointing."
"These fit just fine, but the toe is quite pointy....which I couldn't tell until I got them and opened the box."
"It was smaller than the size of the publication, and the fabric of low quality"
"Looks a bit quickly made around the bottom of the shoe, and it scratches up my Achilles' tendon really badly until I finally wore the shoes down a bit (and even now it still rubs uncomfortably, so I can't wear ankle socks with it), but they're still nice shoes, and I can't find many other shoes with this design and color, so it'll have to do."
It's lightweight and comfy which is great but it really doesn't hold you in or give you smooth lines. It's kind of like pantyhose. But it is very comfy.
"Very fine baby hair slips out of this after a few minutes - and the clips are tough to shut on baby heads because you have to hold them with your fingers so they click and they are very tiny.  They are darling cute, but unfortunately I think we have to wait to use them until our little one (6 months but with a TON of hair) is bigger and her hair a little less fine..."
"ooh quality of the fabric, it stained in blue my little one even after i washed for the first time as i always do with all his new clothes."
"gift to my teen daughter, she likes it just ok... she said it didn't need to be so big and the headphones moving is a waste, no purpose in that."
No padding in the bra and a bit too short for my torso
"These were for my husband. He loves the look of the shoes but... The top of the inside has a stiff part from the lacing and it rubs on the top of my food so it's not the most comfortable, plus the sole padding is minimal not very supportive. After breaking them in, they feel better."
Fabric is not as soft as I have hoped.
"Stretch twill is misleading, as they are not stretchy at all."
Fits a little on the small side.  Better off going a size up
Small and little solid not as expected
the back of the dress is quite low so you will not be able to use a bra with it. Also the fabric is quite see through so use color appropriate underwear!
It's ok.  Normally wear a size 12 and ordered the large./xl but it is really loose.  Probably could have gotten away with the smaller size.
"For the price OK. It is thin but 100% polyester - should last a season or two. As for fit I went with previous reviews saying to get a larger size which was definitely WRONG. I am a definite 34"" waist and the large meant for 34-36 was way too big on the waist. The adjustable drawstring only covers about 1 inch so useless in reducing the waistsize I still had a good 1.5 inch slack. The medium 32-34 fit fine, actually slightly loose - comfortable. So good luck in choosing size. The variance could be with the manufacturing lack of consistency. Made in China."
"Very cute boots. Found I could even get them on and off without using laces. Fit overall seemed right; I am an 8 or 8.5, and the 8 fit fine, even a little roomy, just how I like. However, the part of the boot at the ankle where the hard rubber ends hits right at the anklebone, and it's massively uncomfortable. I have another pair of Bogs, ankle height, with the same problem, and I never wear them. Thick socks didn't even work, they just changed the pain to pressure. No bleeding, but sore bones and tendons. I figured these would cause the same problems. So I'm regrettably returning them. Too bad, because these were cute."
"The shirt is super cute but the pants fit like clown pants. My son is 25lbs at 18 months, so I got the 12-18m size according to previous reviews. But the pants fit weirdly. They came up really high on the waist and ballooned in the crotch. Too bad they don't sell the shirt separately because I wouldnt kept that for sure."
"It is a beautiful shirt, but I had to return it. It runs very, very small. I wear a XXL. The XXL would have fit if I didn't have breasts."
They are the cutuest shoes & once I saw them I really hopped they'd fit  BUT they are poorly designed with the soul support very narrow on the heel. There's no way I could walk in these for even an hours. I wish they would remake these to fit with comfort!
extra large somewhat small.
"I usually love a larks, but these fit a little to long and a little too narrow.  They also seemed very cheap compared to other Clarks I have owned in the past."
"Cool ring, but they small areas that looked pinched down to hold the metallic to the blue eventually separated after a few months! Price is extremely cheap but so is the craftsmanship."
"I'm 5'5"", 160lbs, the large fits.  It doesn't completely hide my rolls, but helps.  I'm involved in dog shows and dog agility, and it does help keep with jiggles/bouncing when I'm running in the ring or on course.  I have found that it starts to ride up if I do not tuck it into my underwear/panties."
"like, but back rub's heal. have to put a cushion or will cut heal"
Stretchy. Feels good on but pills very quickly even before washing. Mainly good for wearing at home.
"I ordered this in blue and it's a gorgeous shade of slate blue. It fits well. It's gattered up the sides so I could wear it now before I start showing and I expect all the way through my pregnancy and beyond. It has a nice sheen to it. I immediately got compliments from my husband who usually doesn't spontaneously comment on my clothes.

Update:
I've worn this top twice and it's already pilling. I can also tell it's going to stretch. Won't be buying this top or type of material again."
length shrinks quite a bit
The zipper  feels tight to zip  (even when I am hanging up on a hanger after wearing)  and I am always afraid when I force it the zipper is going to break.  But it hasn't yet.....
i don't have cankles or anything like that but i just feel these shoes would be more comfortable for a woman with a thin foot.
surprising that these shoes ran small since other jambu sandals were so large that pads were needed to keep the foot from shifting
"If it had fit I totally would be keeping it.  It is cute 50s style dress but it is also a 50s sizing chart because there is no way that this in an xl in today standards.  You can't go off the amazon chart on this.  I am having to return it as there is no larger size available.  I would say maybe the xl would fit a ladies size 10, maybe.  I received this as a promotional test product at a discounted price to test out and review.  This is my limited and unbiased opinion."
It was just like the picture but I didn't know how long the chain was going to be.  It draws too much attention to my chest but it is cute.
Love the jean detail but falls down all the time! I weigh 145 get a smaller size if thats what you weigh I use a hair tie to keep them up
Not is describe
"It is probably best to get toddlers ballet shoes without little ties on the front. If they come untie, which they will do, it distracts. My daughter wants the shoes tied right away when they untie and she will try to stop the instructor from what she is doing to tie her ballet slippers.

But other than the ties in the front, they fit her feet well. They slip on and stay on and she seems to like them in ballet class unless the ties untie and then she if very distracted."
love the look of the boots though they aren't very comfortable. they give me a blister on the back of my foot even with big socks or skinny socks. they hold the cold alot and are heavy. they're really cute and good for working outside but my feet do hurt afterwards
"The leather is a bit stiff so the part that goes over the big toe is a little uncomfortable and cuts a little bit. I'm not certain that for me these would be comfortable for a great deal of walking, but they work ok as I sit doing office work quite a bit in a day. They don't seem to cause any issue with my plantar fasciitis though which is always important for me."
I really don't have much to hold up but these straps struggle to hold me up. Otherwise I really like them. They make great nursing bras.
"I bought these in 5.5w, the W meaning ""wide.""  I buy all my son's shoes in this size (at the moment anyway).  We could barely get my sons feet sqeezed into these shoes.  They were long enough, but we couldn't fasten them - not wide enough!

These look really great though, and they are so light!  I wish they fit him.

Leaving this review just so anyone who needs ""wide"" will know that these will probably not fit."
I typically like the Very Fine shoes.  These are a little larger than the same size in another style.
"I ordered this boots for my dad, who loved them.  However, after just four months, the boots started opening at the sides. At first, there was an issue with sending them back.  However, after much communication with the sellers, the boots were taken back and a full refund given.  For comfort, I would give this five stars.  It is just unfortunate that they did not last long."
I loved the necklace and wore it for two days after I got it. I was setting on the couch and ran my fingers through my hair once. As soon as I did that I caught the chain and it broke immediately. I was super disappointed. I contacted the actual Pyrrha website and ordered a thicker chain for another $60.00. I didn't think it would matter if they replaced the original one because it would probably just break again. Kind of disappointed....
"I love these shoes, and I want to give them a five star rating for stylish, solid construction, nice stacked heel for support, but they are just a bit too narrow in the toes.  Enough so I can't wear them all night.  Major downside.  If I knew I only had to walk in, sit and walk out, they would last all night. My size is 11M.  Normally Clarks are my Go-To shoe for comfort, unfortunately I can't give these shoes my same seal of approval."
"We bought two of these cases (lime and orange) for a trip.  They are cute and protected our glasses well.  However, the inside black liner popped out of one case before we had even used them and had to be glued.  It continues to come apart from the case."
"Ordered these thinking they would be the same as in the picture but when I received them in the mail, i noticed they are more of a lighter shade. No big deal since they are still pretty but wouldve been nice having the deeper shade of color!"
"The bathing suit is really cute but I don't like the zipper. I bought one similar set in Oshkosh Bgosh and I should have bought two sets instead of one. The previous one I bought doesn't have a zipper. I think it's better for little ones to have bathing suits without a zipper on the back. In case, they get hurt when they fall. I think the designer didn't really think about this. And the little that is pretty cute but not easy to keep it on with her hair tied up. Overall, the bathing suit is pretty nice!"
The cork wedgeis a little funky with dark spot but the shoes are for casual beach days. The 7 1/2 is almost too small but the size 8 was too big.  It cost me $15 to return to ship the size 8.  And the shoes were not much more than that so I was not happy about it.
"The arms are a little snub, but still nice."
"It looks good, but it's not as wide as I expected it to be. Feels a little bit uncomfortable."
"We ordered for my granddaughter for Easter.  She LOVED them, but they were too small.  She was able to get them on, but they were crushing her toes at the end.  I also ordered a size 13 for my younger granddaughter and hers fit fine - maybe a little bit on the large side.  Overall, the look is awesome.  I gave three stars only because they didn't fit the older girl as I expected.  As to looks, time of receipt, ease of return, all that was super great."
Bought these for my husband and he loves them. Would give more stars but I did not get the ones I ordered Tortoise...just got brown ones but my hubby was fine with it.
The shoe is beautiful and of good quality but the strap across the toes is way to narrow for my slightly wide feet which causes my little toe to be squashed.
I just wish these weren't so fragile - fishnet should hold shape and last longer than reg. hose.
"I bought these earrings a few months ago. They were gorgeous; they were so delicate and caught the light amazingly well. Unfortunately, they were a little too delicate; while putting one in, I accidentally broke the clasp. I wasn't trying hard at all, so it's a bit of a shame that these earrings are easily damaged."
"In all honesty the necklace looks really neat. I love the octopus design.
But in a different aspect, the quality of this necklace is not very high at all. The chain is either a super light metal or a plastic, and the clasp is definitely plastic. And the octopus is being held on by two small, fragile, rings. If you plan to buy this make sure it doesn't get caught on anything, because I'm thinking even the slightest tug on this thing and it may break. But the design is nice."
The hat was a lot bigger than I expected and the way it was folded in the box left permanent creases on it.
Runs small a full size small...hard buy shoes on line...but gave it a shot. Good product just hard to buy online
"This costume served its purpose.  It's really nothing more then a t-shirt with a cheap peace of cloth sewn to the back and a cheap mask.  The shirt was smaller then expected, but all in all it worked out OK."
"I'm a little out of shape. Not as flattering as I had hoped. I'm between a med & large, so ordered the large since this is a tighter fitting top. Length was too long for me on the large.  Liked the fabric & pattern."
Started falling apart within days. Way too short for my sons convers shoes.
Nice shoes for my toddler but they don't hold up very long. Not durable at all.
The shoe looks great in person but the sizing run small. I normally wear a size 8.5 or 9 and I had to order a size 10. Dealing with the exchange and refunds went smoothly
"NICE LOOKING WATCH, BAND WAS A BEAUTIFUL RED BUT WAS WAY TOO SHORT AND I HAD TO SEND IT BACK."
"The cap sleeves are a bit narrower than I expected, and the whole bodice part fits higher than I'd like, but it's still a nice dress.  I'm 5'7"" and it fit about tea-length.  The waist line fits higher under the bust, but I don't know if that's a sizing issue or a me-issue."
"These are so cute, but the strap that goes across the foot, is too tight for my 18 month old's fat foot. She is in a size 3 right now (had to purchase a size 4 as it was the smallest available), but even being a size too big, they were too tight due to the strap. My older daughter likes the other crocs similar to this, where the strap is diagonal. I may try those as it fits my older daughters foot perfectly."
Cute. Nice for quick trips to the store when you don't want to carry your usual handbag.  Very soft. Lots of room in this little bag for phone and other purse essentials.  Wish I could find something similar in leather.
the glue behind the mirror has started to lift after 2 weeks.. and the inner divider lifts as well
These shoes are comfortable but run really small. You must go up almost a extra size and a half to be comfortable.
"I like Bella Vita's wide wide styles, if I order up a size they fit my super wide foot well.  This is a cute, kind of retro 40's style, but the quality of the finish is a little bit plastic looking.  They will be fine for work shoes, but not good enough for a fancy dress."
Greatfor beach or casual swimming.  Wore out after 3 months of thrice weekly aquabootcamp.  Stitching came out of the toe area and inner sole lining lifted. No arch support or significant cushion on the bottom. Recommend this for infrequent casual wear.
I returned it.  It wasn't my dress.
The medium was more like a small. I have other Calvin Klein thongs that are mediums and fit perfectly. The purple color is amazing! But somebody stole my clothes with this one pair of underwear in it and now Amazon is out of stock :-(
This is really cute but totally runs small. I ordered a 2x (I'm a 14) and it felt like I was squeezing into a Large! Order a couple sizes larger than what you are.
"I couldn't even get all of my toes into the shoe. Very tight and narrow! I have small feet. Not even wide. I'm not overweight or have swollen feet.. but these shoes were so tight I couldn't even try both of them on. I bought the size 5 because that's what I always wear. I've worn many naturalizer shoes since it is my favorite brand. I've bought one sandals that hurt a bit but I was able to stretch them out a bit over time. But these, with these it will be impossible. They're sadly having to be returned. I'm not sure if getting a half size up will help to be honest.. might still be super tight but just longer. Boohoo!"
Fits well. One star off for shallow front pockets.
"I really really wanted to love this sweater. The color is gorgeous, the crochet is interesting, and it's a lot warmer than it looks! I sized up according to reviews here and that was the right decision. However, the cut was just not flattering on me. If you are slim, it will look great! If you have bumps like I do, it tends to cling to every curve in a not so flattering way. Wearing the right bra is also something to consider - you'll need something low cut."
"SO PRETTY but I think they're too narrow, they're super tight across my foot. I wish they came in a wide width. But they're so elegant, and the soles feel pretty comfortable. Really a beautiful shoe that just doesn't work on my feet."
"I bought this product for the rave reviews that Glamorise usually receives, but I found that it was too small."
"Though the item is really nice it is not what I expected.  It was a lot darker than I wanted it to be.  Not shiny like silver, more dull and gray than I expected.  The weight is nice and the letters legible but not something I would give the person I bought it for.  I returned it."
"Because I thought this was a women's hoodie I ordered a large and it was way too big.  When I contacted Amazon they made a call and found that this hoodie is not available in women's sizes and that the confusion was caused by a misprint. As you can see, the mistake has yet to be corrected, so beware.  The main reason I'm writing a review is to talk about the hood.  When up, the hood raises the shoulders which causes pressure on one's head, making it very uncomfortable.  Im not sure that's clear.  In other words, when one puts up the hood there's more than an inch gap between your own shoulder and that of the hoodie.  There probably wasn't enough material allowed for the hood, making it much too tight vertically.  I hope that's clear.  Otherwise, it's a nice shirt, good weight."
For the monies they are nice and my daughter loves them . They would be a nice fife for a weeding party
The build of these seems nice and solid. The fit was smaller than I expected in a EE width. Perhaps I need to go 4E.
"Pros:
Cute
Thin for summer
Fits perfectly and probably will last my daughter through 6 mos (she's 3 1/2 mos right now)

Cons:
Zipper constantly gets stuck
Ironed on decals are already starting to crack and come off after 2 washes
Pattern really seems more boyish than unisex"
To small to wear had to give them away.
Not as comfortable as I had expected for the price
Bag is starting to tare in certain places.
"I got an XXL because I didn't want it to cling to me and as it turns out the XXL fit my shoulders and that surprised me as my true size is XL from
the photo the shirt looks longer than what it is but I will keep it even if it is a little clingy won't get another."
"This bra is perfect for a short run (5-6 miles) or working out at the gym. However, I am runner and end up with chaffing to the inside of my upper arms and underneath breasts from the underwire if I do anymore than 8 miles."
It's a nice hat but fit very large. I'll have it tucked and keep getting up.
Sheinside items are super cute but fits really small. I bought a large but it was too snug for the look. I had to buy another one - xl.
"This really runs small.  I like Carhartt, but wish the material wasn't so stiff.  Will be OK to work in barn in winter."
"This item was what was expected and good enough for the price that was paid. However, the tendrils of curl coming off the sides are attached in weird places and not necessarily above the ears as pictured. We had to cut them and bobby pin them into the right place. One was attached at the nape of the neck like a rat tail."
"These glasses look great and are as described. They aren't super dark even though they look it in the pics. The are also extremely light, which is good, but also not so good as they're also pretty flimsy. I still recommend them."
"beautiful set , but the pants are small , you must choose a greater size to that used in other brands that fit well"
"The neckline is really wide, which I don't like much. The sleeves are a little Amal for my liking, but my chunky baby still has room so not too tight. They're not terrible, but they work!"
I love the look of these shoes I just wish I had got them 1/2 size smaller. Because their are no shoe strings you cant take up the gaping that occurs around the ankle. As soon as I put them on an walk they rubbed the back of my heel. I had to order heel strips that have padding an I pulled the cord an tied a small bow so I can get some use out of theses shoes.
"Waste of money. They are as they are stated which is why I still gave them 3 stars, but I saw no improvement while driving at night."
"I have higher quality nato straps. This one is definitely synthetic leather and feels lesser quality but for $6.99 price I got on this, it was a decent deal."
Cute shirt. The velcro on the cape gets gunked up fast though.
"These are huge  had to give them to my son.  Not the sellers fault,  just make sure you check the sizes before ordering"
Good support but disappointing that they are 1 time use hose. Both pairs run on the 1st wear. Great if not in a dress.
"Just didn't look as I expected it too look.  Fluffs out fine after opening and allowing it to ""breath"" for a while to unkink."
They are very hard to put on I can hardly get my foot into them. Once my foot is in they seem to fit fine its just trying to put them on is so hard I have only used them twice.
"Nice length both covering fanny and over the wrists.  HOWEVER - I have a woman's shape which no longer looks really great with the ""shaping"" that is in every darn shirt and coat anymore.  Am thinking that I will start buying men's - they don't have to worry about not having a waist:-)"
I was hoping to wear these in my classroom but they make my feet so sweaty! I was looking for zero drop shoes that would be comfortable while teaching. I couldn't find any cute looking shoes so I wanted to try these funky ones. They would be perfect minus the sweating aspect. Maybe others wouldn't have this problem.
"Super soft and very comfortable, however as I expected they slide down around my ankles when I walk"
This bra is adequate. I like that I can convert it to racerback. That's usually how I wear it because I feel like the straps are a little loose even when tightened all the way. This is not the bra I reach for daily but I will keep it in my collection because it looks nice and fits adequately. I am hoping that it will loosen up a bit with time. I am a 34DDD and I find the band a little too tight after a few hours of wear.
"I am an average size 8.  These were a size 8, but much too big. The strap to tighten these is very difficult to do, especially if  you have trouble bending down.  I am returning these, but in the meantime I ordered and received a size 7 1/2.  These fit much better. But I still can't figure out how to tighten  them  easily and quickly.  Once you do get them on tightly, they are pretty comfortable."
"Not really the top quality I thought socks to be. My fault. The socks Im looking for are thicker in the foot area and the leg part is different. These are ok, but not really my first choice."
Did not like feel
"Even though this dress is forgiving around the waistline, the bottom half is somewhat transparent."
Leather is treated and slips out of my pocket too easily.  I had to stretch multiple card pockets in order for my cards to sit correctly.  Aside from that it seems like decent quality but I'm guessing it'll take a year of wear before I'm happy with it compare to my old wallet.
I would have given a better review if it wasn't for the fact that there was a spot on the lense that looked like the color melted or something. But honestly other than that they are very cute and I like them.
The collar is to big for my taste :(
"These boots are very cool looking and comfortable to wear.  Sizing, as seems to be the constant case with Vivibarefoot, is smaller and narrower than the models in their earlier years.  I had to get a 43 in these because the 42 was much too narrow.  My foot is wide but not so wide that I have to buy wide shoes in conventional brands.  Because the suede is soft and the boot is too long the leather just above the sole of the heal is wearing away because I step on it as I am walking.  If it wasn't for this I'd give it 4 stars.  Also, I got this as an Amazon Warehouse Deal purchase so it was less expensive so I am a little more tolerant of the wear.  If I'd paid the standard price I would be very displeased as they are quite expensive shoes and should fit and wear better."
"Good price if you have a prime account. Color was exactly the color I needed. Some of the pictures are a little more purple, it's not that purple, more magenta like a few of the pictures. It's not as bow shaped as they mentioned. It's kinda square and floppy. The center stripe of material on mine is bent on one side."
"Since I returned them, I guess the answer to how I liked them is obvious.  I tried them on in a store in a different color and they were perfect.  Ordered the color that I wanted and squeezed my feet...just shows the inconsistencies in Nike sizing."
Perfect Style but runs small
"Definitely small. Size up, for sure.
Also fabric isn't what you'd expect from the photo, fabric has a kind of sheen to it...more akin to those sweat-wicking athletic shirts than to cotton."
"I got this for my unborn daughter so she hasn't worn it yet. It's soft for sure but looks kinda dirty, hopefully when I wash it it will look better. Really cute though"
"These are cute, but very tiny!"
"These could be nice boots. The leather is really nice and smells great. They seems a little fragile though. When I got them, they came with a few nicks in the leather already and part of the boot looked like it had chemicals spilled on it (liquid-like spots not matching the other coloring pattern). I wasn't a big fan of the way the toes are black and fade into brown. It's not a smooth fade at all and there are super tiny black specks over the rest of the boot. I might have kept them if I ordered half a size up and a different color."
It is nice but it is too small
"Slightly more comfortable than a pair of Converse All Stars, which i consider to be a contender for the least comfortable shoes ever made. Quality, and for seem decent and they look good"
I did not find these comfortable. I also sized up because of reviews and should have sized down. I ended up ordering a different brand because these did not work out for me.
"This pair is running small. I have several pair of these and most fit perfectly, but this gray pair is the only pair that I found smallish."
"I am 5'2"", bra size 32D, pants size small, 2 to 4. The top actually fits well, the bottoms fit ok but I would have preferred them to be less fitted. I did wash them and still fit the same. They did wrinkle quite a bit after drying even though I removed them immediately when the cycle ended, despite using fabric softener and drying sheet."
"I got this coat for milder winter days when my puff is too warm. It does the job and is a nice enough coat, but the snap on the pocket fell off within two weeks of receiving and the coat had to be replaced. The sleeves are also long and need to be taken up. A decent coat for the price but nothing special. And not warm enough for colder winter weather."
"Nice boot, but it is a little narrow on my foot, so I am hoping being leather it will stretch out and form better to my foot once they get worn in.  My first pair which were the same size fit great, and were very comfortable.  Although I like the boot, I think next time around I would look for a boot with a softer leather, and a little wider."
Love the look but too largely over.
These sneakers are okay. No arch support. But other than that the sneakers are okay.
"This has a somewhat wide body, which seems short. Not a great fit, good at work wear. Good price."
Not as great in person. Runs big
very lite
"Cant wear heavy socks with them, but if you wear a thin dress sock you can wear them most of the day
Shame their a little tight because they appear to be made well"
Light pink color is a bit sheer- I bought a few colors for my daughter to just wear around.
"I love how warm these jeans are.  They are a little loose in the legs and they gap in the back on a curvy figure, but I've always had that problem, so not a deal breaker for me.  The three star rating is because after the second wash, the flannel on the right bottom hem started coming apart from the jeans.  I was able to do two small rolls at the bottom to hide it (I'm short, only 5'3""), but a little disappointing to happen after such a short period of time."
"I am size 5 and they are too big for me. If you are size 6, they will probably be ok."
Comfy and cute but I ordered coral and it's actually a baby pink color. Not my style
maybe need the skinny top part
"They're comfortable, with a ""wear to work"" feel.  Definitely not dressy, and the color was definitely on the yellow side of tan."
"Just got this item. When I took it out it looked very similar to a training bra in style and size. It does have a healthy amount of stretch to it in the cups (I am a D and it was a great cup fit with no spillage), but I found it does run a tad bit smaller around the torso. The fabric is insanely soft and while not the prettiest thing to look at, I can see this product being something very soft and comfy for smaller frames and bust. I hate it didn't work out for me as it really is super soft, but can't win them all!"
"They're bigger than I expected, the pinky finger is way too long.  They seem like someone stitched these together at home."
love the Jambu's but they all seem to fit a bit differently.  This one is too wide for my foot.  Must wear socks with them.
"I'm a true 7.5 narrow. These shoes were the perfect width, but they were not long enough, I need a 1/2 size up.  My toes were almost hitting the shoe."
"For what this is, Londontown's nail hardener is overpriced.  First of all, the packaging says may be used as a base coat.  For me, that didn't quite work because, having heavily ridged nails, this polish did NOT apply smoothly, and did not allow me to leave my nail with complete coverage of polish over my nails.  So that meant I had to apply another brand of base coat over that in order to be able to finish my manicure.

As far as hardening properties, can't say this did much of anything.  Some of my nail are fairly pliable, and even with this hardener they basically stayed the same after application.

Can't say I can recommend Londontown nail hardener and base coat, and especially not at THIS price."
Tight. But decoration is bright...OUCH MY TOES!!
They are a rectangle so the name is misleading or wrong. Still cheap and decent. Orange color is a good depiction.
"Cutter and Buck shirt are top of the line.  Love the look and the fit.  But if are not ""BIG AND TALL""  I mean bigger than normal, go with the regular and do not order Big and Tall."
"It was good for a quick laugh, but was unfortunately too small for my BF's large noggin."
Quality is great. Dont forget to be in a good shape - you will appear as is.
"These were ok.  The fur shed a bit too much for my liking, but they served their purpose for one night."
Will return this pair that was too small even though I ordered my usual size.  I only gave them three stars because something must be off with the sizing.  I have already ordered the next size larger.
"I like these shoes. They are really cute. They look good on the foot and are comfortable but they are not as comfortable as other Clark sandals I own. I love my Clark's Hayla Theme wedge the best but I wanted a flat sandals so I bought these. I don't know why Clark's went to cheap construction on this particular shoe. They are not as cushy and the sole is glued on rather then sewn on. Like I said, I do like them and because I got them for under $50,  I will keep and wear them. I do hope they last a couple of years."
It isn't the bright red that it looks like online. It kinda looks a little pink in person. Disappointed cuz I wanted a true red beanie.
Color is more orangey then red. I am a medium but had to order a large after sending one back.
"If you are looking for a nice boot for cool or cold weather get the StrideRite Garrett instead. Much sturdier and lined. These are unlined, not that warm, and get soaked thru fast"
"Good pair of socks, some pilling, just wish they were cheaper or had a bulk option."
"Good sturdy jeans with a good fit, but I wish the fly zipper was just a bit longer"
Sculpted right shirt even in plus size
"These shoes are a little short.  I can wear them but the comfort level goes down as the day goes on.  Also, the soles are relatively thin, so I can slightly feel the things I'm walking on.  The look is great and I am going to keep them, but I wish they were just a tad longer."
"Actually, these shorts are pretty good, except for the Velcro pockets. They are a pain in the rump! OK, you're trying to put your wallet, for instance, in your hip pocket; you fight the Velcro flap up, then TRY to get that wallet in there, but before you can, the flap simply falls down and INSTANTLY locks down, and now you have to do it again, and again, and again, until sometimes it takes two (2) hands to get the job done, SO, you wind up tucking the flap into the pocket out of frustration, making the garment much less attractive. Just saying....USE SNAPS, LEE!!!"
"Love these shoes, but little narrow!"
Run very small even by size chart.
Disappointed that the locket is not substantially attached to the chain.  Had to do some adjustments for my Granddaughter
"It's very flattering but the top is too transparent. You have to wear something underneath it and then if it's a camisole, now you have camisole lines under the skirt and you don't feel quite as hot with weird lumps on your hourglass."
"I ordered a 9N but they were too wide.  Looks like they were well made and would be a comfortable shoe, just too big...."
"Shorts are cute, but were sized more like an extra-small than a medium. It worked out okay as we were thinking a medium would be too big."
Shrunk in the dryer and legs too short now
"Jacket had a strong chemical/ leather smell when I took it out of packaging but dissipated by the next day. Jacket was too small for me in the chest area so I returned it. (Im a size small, 34DD) I ended up finding another one I liked more. Jacket does feel a bit cheap -but you get what you pay for.  if you are looking for a deal and don't want to pay hundreds for a genuine  leather jacket, this is it. It does run small through chest area so order up a size."
"Worked great at first, I've had it a month and now I can't change the time none of the buttons work."
"It's really cute, but the chain is so fragile! It popped off and broke when I sneezed while wearing it. It broke twice and I've managed to put it back, but I don't think it will last like this much longer. I will need to get a new chain for it. Other than that, it is so pretty and it arrived here way earlier than I expected!"
"Belt functions okay. But I wanted the one in the photo that had the belt and buckle the same color. The one I got, the belt is tan, like I wanted, the buckle is dark brown. Don't care for the contrast."
I wear size 8.5 and usually size up for flat sandals. The 9 was still a teeny bit small.
"These keep falling down. The waist is too big. I'll propably sew some additional elastic in the back. Too bad cause I do like the jeans. I'm 5'3"" and they are a little too long."
"The small is really small, fits my 4 year old who is 3'8"" and 32lbs (he's the size or a 3 year old)"
"Work great, however they are a little tight if you have earphone on underneath"
Loved the vest but it ran small. Was very sad that it didn't fit.
Nice dress but the size is somewhat small.
item fits true to size but material is on the very thin side.
"Dress fit around fine, but I found this dress to be short-waisted and the darts for the breasts area was too high. It was like it needed 2 more inches added to the top of the shoulder area. Stitching at the zipper was very close and made zipping it past one area difficult."
"Comfortable material and well made, but over sized for me.  I had to return for refund, did not want to a chance on a size smaller. The length was the main reason for return.  I'm an XL, but this almost felt like a XL Tall.
Sorry, I really looked forward to this sweater."
heavy sandal
Not soft material but it fitted ok. Not my favorite
Small on top but bottom fits well.
There is something to be said for zippers on boots. I find these boots to be very difficult to put on and have to loosen all the laces to accomplish this. So if you don't mind spending a good few minutes putting on your boots these are a possible choice. They are sturdy and fit the combat boot look and function.
"I brought the boot and they are comfortable. I can walk all day in these, but a few days later the boot began to split up the middle. The top seam just began to pop. The boots are not tight, so I was surprised.  I guess that's what you get for this price."
Even the wide is very narrow and not tall. They squeezed the tops of my sons feet. Nice looking shoes but we had to return them.
They get fuzzys on my feet. And lint all over the socks after washing.  Not the best quality. They're still cute though
They are much smaller than I thought they would be
"Fits very well but its just very plain, safe."
Not what they used to be.  Fabric is not cotton anymore. ..some sort of blend. Not as thick as they used to be either.
I bought two. The sewing on one of them at the top back side was getting loose. But overall ok for the price.
"I have some older (8-10 years old) Champion shorts and they are thicker material and not as long and baggy, I like the old ones much better than these. These feel kind of cheap, and I guess they are. For the price they're pretty good."
The shoes appeared to be of solid construction and were comfortable to a point. The problem I had that led me to return them was a small (for me) toe box that was evident as soon as I tried them on. I walk a lot in nicer weather and knew this would not work. I normally wear a 13 D and most shoes  that size fit well. These were snug in the toe area with cushy socks on.
"I have 3 other pairs of Skechers and they have a wonderfully soft  memory foam, like walking on a cloud. I don't need to add an insert. These shoes are not as soft. They are nice to look at, color is perfect. I ordered the  chocolate. I ordered 1/2 size larger and the fit is great. It just lacks the soft insole I'm used to having in these shoes. I'm keeping them and passing them to any family that gets here first. They will be well used. Only not by me. I'm going to reorder."
"Nice bra, but runs a little on the small side. It is still a comfort to wear and washes well."
"A bit too big. I recommend ordering a size smaller to get a good fit.mapart from that, great shoe."
"Classic style, wish it were more slender in the band though"
"No padding whatsoever. Cute though, definitely runs at least one size small."
I love the shoe but it doesn't fit a normal 8.5. It's a bummer!!  Naturalizer's sizes are not standard across their brand which is a hassle and annoying.
"I'm not sure about the current style of dresses having this high waistline...so if you are apple shaped, it's not a good look."
"Expected better from Gold Toe, the tops of the socks are already becoming frayed."
"I ordered these shoes in navy, when I got them the box said navy but the shoes were definitely black.  I assume they sent me the wrong color but the shoes themselves did not say what color they were.  I didn't need black and they were a little small. I returned them but I did like the shoe.  I would order a size up, but if these had been the right color I would have kept them.  I didn't exchange them because I was unsure about the navy color."
"It's cute, and a good size with adequate space. But the material is super stiff and stinky (I should have known better with the low price tag,  it smells like crude oil). Plus, it got shoved in a box that was too small and now has a crease and two weird bumps on it that won't come out."
"Comfy, but a bit too small"
"look good, fit a little small"
"This looks way better in the picture than it does in real life. It's got a very prominent blue stripe, whereas it looks more pure white in the picture. But that's not the real issue. It's very baggy, but worse, too short. Granted, I'm tall, but I'm not an Amazon. What's the purpose of a shirt like this if it looks like it could fit two of you in it, but it comes only slightly below your waist?

I really can't recommend it, unless you're a size 20 and you're 4 ft. tall!"
I bought a large (and I'm in a medium for my reg clothes) because the reviews said it runs small. And it comes to about 3 inches under my belly button. Waaay too small.
"Material feels well made and has a bit of stretch.  I was very disappointed it didn't fit.  I ordered a 6P which is the smallest size offered.  I have an odd shape (big butt small waist) and was hoping the elastic waist would help the gap in the back I get with normal jeans.  The 6p in the size chart was marked for 36 in hip and 25.5 in waist.  I have a 36 in hip and 24.5 in waist and i was drowning in them.  It felt 1 or 2 sizes too large.  I will get a label to return them tomorrow.  I don't know if it is a vanity size thing or if I just got mismarked pants.  They came quickly and look nice and well made, just didn't fit."
"This is really small even though I ordered a 2XL.  The models must be really petite.  I will probably return it.  I love the detail on the back and the quality seems good.  I would be afraid that it would shrink when washed, however."
very nice and wonderful but very narrow even size 2d
I love the shoes but they run small
Short in length for the male shirt otherwise nice heavy fabric. True to color
"Feels like a cheap china made material, im too lazy to return it"
The waistband was way too loose
"I bought these for my mom who has problems with her feet. Unfortunately, the strap over the top was too constricting for her."
"Its a hoodie. Comfortable to wear, however, the hood comes to a very sharp point. Could bring about awkward situations."
"I bought the panties along with the matching bra and was excited about their bright colors.  The colors are accurate to what is shown in the photos.  What I don't like about the set, is the fabric.  It isn't very soft and can irritate the skin a bit in high friction areas.  I wear them, but they aren't my favorite."
"As an avid diver, and collector of ""lower"" priced dive watches ($500 or less) I was excited to add this watch to my collection after reading the reviews-only to be let down after months of ownership.  The watch band is a NIGHTMARE to get sized.  Three different shops and $45 later, I have a completely rigged band.  The other major flaw in this watch is that it runs as much as 5 minutes a day fast!!  A minute fast here or there is one thing-but this thing is ALWAYS fast.  If you wear it on a boat (which divers tend to do-duh) it messes with the time, or running, exercise, etc.  I find myself adjusting the time almost daily.  The positives are the solid feel and orange face, but would go with rubber band.  Would suggest the Pulsar Solar 4000 (for less money I might add) if you are looking for the battery free, heavy duty, everyday dive watch style.  The Citizen Eco Drive Dive Watch is another great option as well.  Both of which are dive tested and come through excellent.  Can't recommend this watch unless you are not very active, and you know someone who works for Seiko and can size it properly."
Pulls very easily.  Do not wear a bracelet with any clasp when wearing or you can throw the shawl out when you are done.  Also has a weird smell like plastic or something when arrived.
"I don't want you to get the wrong Idea abut these with me only giving it three stars. The fit and construction of these are actually excellent and I have bought several pairs of them.

The reason I am only giving these three stars is they never seem to last longer than six months.

My Wife claims I have a fabric destruction field about my body."
fabric is stiff so it doesn't flow at all.
Adorable costume!  Super warm and fuzzy!  Unfortunately it was way to small for my child.
Would reorder in wide width.
"Very cute shoe, but the sides bow out when I walk. The support factor is zero."
"My friend she likes it, for some reason it runs a size smaller than ordered, would recommend to order one sz bigger, other than that its ok."
Definitely get these a few sizes larger then you normally wear.
"I like the fact that these slippers are boiled wool - which are the best kind - and that you can wear them outside because of the solid tennis shoe-like soles.  BUT, because the interior is like a tennis shoe, the slippers feel kind of clammy and cold - so not so cozy."
"Shrunk a bit after washing but they just barely fit. also 2 buttons fell off in the washer. I bought 3 other pairs from other venders and not the same issue. better order I size bigger, and be ready with a thread and needle"
Runs on the narrow side. Length is true to size but they are too narrow for me.
super cute good quality but tight across the arch
"A size larger would have been much better. Doubt my husband will wear as too uncomfortable..concept is good, but men won't suffer for fashion like women will"
"I love the bag, but after one use it started to tear in the corner."
"I ordered the black, 8.5C. Searching for a shoe that offers good support and comfort has been difficult. 30 minutes after walking in these clogs at the grocery store my lower back began to severely ache, but my feet and legs were very much pain free. While these shoes felt great on my feet, it makes me have bad posture (also, my arches have fallen). I tried adjusting my posture without any success. The problem is while these shoes are very comfy to the feet they have no arch support. I will keep the shoes but can only wear them for short periods at a time."
Fit As expected but the leg length seems a lot longer than what I ordered. Unfortunately it does not stand up to battery acid like the double knee pants I usually buy.
"i like how it looks and it fits true to size but quality is pretty bad, the seams are already coming apart after wearing once"
"These shoes were very cute but fit at least a full size bigger. I was very disappointed because I wanted them for school. I will have to wait until spring, and hopefully they will fit my daughter then."
"This is a beautiful bag; however it is very, very heavy.  Because it is so heavy I cannot carry it comfortably on my shoulder.  Unfortunately I had to send it back."
"just the sizing was wrong. the pink pair i ordered a size larger and fits perfect. again, i cannot return due to Amazon says ""return window has closed"". It sucks being disabled with Lyme disease, in/out of hospital so i am not always home to return within 'store' guidelines! and online is the only way i can shop!  Disappointed in amazon for not being more flexible for certain circumstances....."
"May work for a flat stomach if you don't bend over much, but for me it was uncomfortable. They fit fine, but I don't like to be aware I am wearing anything and the band was very stiff and would poke me if I bent over."
Its a little awkward to use but good storage
This swimsuit is adorable but I gave it 3 stars for it's fit and overall comfort level. It is very snug even though I bought a size up intentionally.
"Not as roomy as you would hope, fit for for a big boy than young man. :/"
occasion
I didn't like the style of the  back.
The bra cups were odd in that they were a cone shape when I wore it. The seams could also be seen if i wore it under a t-shirt.  The straps felt uncomfortable within a couple of hours.
"As usual, with a garment made in Asia, it does run smaller than our sizes in the US.  The body fit as expected and the sleeves were a bit tight.  The color was true to the picture.  The fabric does not feel like linen, though it has that texture, and feels like polyester.  There is very little give in the fabric.  It does have a nice drape and movement."
"Noisy but it is to be expected with a quartz movement. The watch overall looks really nice and for the price it can't be beat. This is my ""daily beater"" watch meaning you can wear it, look nice and not worry about hitting or damaging it. Would buy again."
"I love the color of this shoe. It's surprisingly neutral and looked well with black, blue, light and dark brown. Unfortunately the shoe was just not that comfortable. I returned them."
Cute for the price but wore it once  for about 4 hours and its tarnished already
"I was looking for a small wallet, but this one is much too small.  My driver's license wouldn't fit into the ID pocket, so I didn't even try to fit my credit cards in."
"It didn't meet my expectations because I have flat and wide feet. When I tried them on they did not feel comfortable for my foot was not balanced, therefore unstable. I think I'm going to try the Asics next too bad not many stores have them to try on but I've only heard good things about it"
"Looks cheap. in the picture you see it looks full and soft but in real life the ""fur"" looks matted, dull, and flat."
"Very comfortable I just didn't really like the Mary Jane look on my foot.  Also I just didn't like the thick white heel.  However, very lightweight but not stylish - at least not my style."
They're what I wanted - inexpensive canvas shoes to do errands in or to go to work in (I sit most of the day). I'm buying insoles for them which will improve the comfort and make it easier to wear/walk in longer.  A less expensive solution.
"This is not a ""no show"" sock.  And the claim for arch support is bogus. The elastic around the ankle buried it self in my skin within an hour. However, the material is soft.  Once the elastic stretches, this may be a salvageable purchase.  But it won't replace the super-cheap ""no show"" socks from the big box stores."
Had to return it because the pull up handle was very flimsy and didn't work very well.  The look of it was nice but it seemed like the handle would break.
"I am loyal to Dickies products and have been for about 17 years.  This belt left me a little disappointed.  First of all, it barely fit though the loops in my Dickies shorts.  I made it fit but it kind of caused unnecessary wear to the belt.  I could not tuck the additional belt back through a second time after hooking the buckle.  The buckle is also a problem.  It is one of those that just has a post on the back of the buckel that you have to line up with the hole on the belt.  So you have to pull on one end of the belt while pushing down on the buckle hoping it lines up with the hole.  It is difficult to get it to feel snug.  It is also a little smaller than a typical belt.  I ordered it larger than I normally do and it fit with very little excess.  Unfortunately this will probably not be an everyday belt."
"This is my third pair of this style and about my 12th pair of Skechers, so far the only brand of shoe that I can wear comfortably and walk in most of the day.
While all others ordered have fit perfectly, for some reason the straps on these are very loose, and my first impression was that they were used shoes, almost as though someone wore them and stretched them out.  I am unable to return them so will grin and bear it.  For the most part, I am a diehard Skechers fan."
"It's not the product's fault, but I didn't know what size to order my grandchild and I ordered it too big."
"Given the price and quantity - they met expectations, but nothing special"
I took the pads out of this and use them as sleeping nursing bras. So great!
"Smaller than ithought for ""big boys"". My son is large for a four year old but i doubt this will last more than one season."
"Originally ordered a 9.5 N and had to exchange them for a 10 N.  They run more narrow than most Walking Cradles. Also, I am not crazy about the footbed. Despite the description that they have a tiny pillows footbed cushions every step, they feel hard & stiff to me."
"Beautiful but I was unable to put them on. This boots are very beautiful, they arrived on time but when I tried to put them on they are so tied that I couldn't get my feet in them although I ordered a size up. Unfortunately I have to return them."
"The shirt fit is around average/healthy/sort of slim but not skinny and material is good and solid and the Marina Blue looks nice.

However... the bottom of this shirt is too long, it is almost like a dress if you don't tuck it in. Now some guys may enjoy wearing a short dress out in public but not me, I have to tuck it in to keep things looking somewhat presentable."
Shirts are a bit scratchy. They don't breed as well as other shirts of the same polycotton blend
"Thicker material then I wanted and larger then usual for the size I usually order, and I like things a little baggy. I like that there is no Spandex!"
This is a present and I am sure she will like it the colors are sparkly and the earing look good with it.
"Looks nice,but chain kept folding and bend. I ordered two because the price. Next time I would save my money,for something a little better. I feel this is a Cheaply made product!"
"Nice dress, moderate quality, fits well, overpriced. Semi-thin cheaper quality fabric for the price. Not see-thru and if your trim you can get away with wearing this without shapewear, this dress will require seemless panties though."
"i loved the color, now the material not that much, ill have to wait for classes to start to see how that goes for me and my Little one, and then ill be letting you know for sure!"
The earrings are well-made and do shine- especially after being cleaned- but the stones are so big that they don't look real at all. I will still wear them for fun but if you're trying to fool someone it's not going to happen.
"It's alright, the tissue paper that was wrapped around it during shipping was stuck on all the jewels, after a week still haven't gotten it all off. Afraid I may pull jewels off.  It will work for what I wanted it for. (Gotta get tissue off first though)"
"I'm very small so I usually roll my eyes when things say, ""too small"". This was not kidding. If you're over 105lbs, get the medium-at least the bottoms. The top fit great."
"The shoes looks awesome. I am normally a 4.5- so thats what i ordered. These are a bit too long, and they are very tight as well.
But i love them! Bought a sneaker stretcher just for these so i can continue to wear them with comfort!"
I wanted to love these but they just aren't comfortable enough for me. I need a little more cushion in my shoe or it won't be a go to shoe. Super cute boots though.
The price is good but the color was really off. I received a dark Navy instead of the color on the listing.
"A very light scent which I enjoy, not overpowering at all.  It's so light, in fact, that it doesn't last very long at all which may be a good thing depending on your view of fragrance and how strongly you want it to present itself.  I do not like the bottle cap design, the second time I removed the top, the chrome spray cover came off and leaked everywhere.  Other than that I would recommend this for guys who want a light, fresh scent that won't clear a room."
"Good when I'm playing, but these are NOT shoes to walk around in"
Although nice looking it is difficult to get in and out of. It has no give in the top center under the bra ...and little support on the bra section and bottom. . Like the length of it and the look.
Wrinkly material.
"Very cute, but unfortunately it only lasted a day before the one gem fell off, making this purchase not worth it for me. Shipping was also slow."
Too expensive but cute. Not any better quality in my view than the ones from other retailers available for half the price.
"I ordered these slippers for my 80 year old Mom.  I have a pair and love them.  However, the opening for the foot on a size 6 must be much smaller than mine is for a size 7.  Mom said they were so tight to get on that she ended up with bruising on her foot.  Granted she is 80, and has the fragile skin that we all will acquire with age.  But, being so difficult to get the shoe on is a deal breaker, and she is returning them."
Even though I ordered an extra small it still was a bit large. The size chart has XS as 33-34 inches however the scrub is actually 35 inches. The material is a bit on the thin side. It only has 1 pocket that's on the left chest. The colour is nice though.
Gift for my wife. She has used it for a couple days and the bag already started to rip.
"Its not great qualilty, so I only use it to store cards I don't use often.  I think it would wear out quickly if it was used daily."
this  dress runs very small US 16  is a US 14.
Way to large on top of the design.
"Umbrella was ok but not great quality for the price. The color was awful, more of an ugly mustard shade."
"It's okay, it fits good everywhere except the shape of the body seems large?? The arms, chest etc good but the flow is too much material."
A little light and way to small but pretty
"have had 2 pairs of these, will likely look for another shoe next time.  Just not for me.  They are well constructed and last, but just not quite right for me"
undersized
"These shorts looked super cute and comfy. Unfortunately, even though I picked a size based on the size chart and my measurements when they came they were at least one if not two sizes too big. As such, I never got to wear them and had to return them so I'm not able to give a more thorough review. Giving three stars because they still looked like good shorts, I'll probably repurchase and update this review once I get a pair that fits."
SHOES WERE OKAY. WORE WHOLE DAY AND FIT OKAY
Great pants but they run small. I am a 12 and ordered a 16 and they fit.
The stone is different than the picture
These pants were ok and had pockets which I wanted.  Could have ordered one size smaller.  Normally wear a 16.  These were an 18.  I'll keep them though because they are good enough for using around home.
"This is made of 100% cotton. It arrived with no front crease in spite of there being one shown in the picture. After washing it definitely required ironing - not something I can do easily. I love Dockers, but not the Khaki ones. These will definitely be worn only for very casual use."
"Nice dress but don't have high expectations on the quality. There was a slight wardrobe malfunction on the dress, there is a space between where the zipper ends and the zipper lining therefor my daughter's underwear was peeping ( very slightly) though."
not as good as i hoped... too big
"A good product, but not perfect 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"
"I didn't really love these and sent them back.  My little discs were closer together than pictured.  They are a white silver tone in a medium weight.  They were fine, just not for me."
the picture of it makes it seem like it is silver but it's not.  I'll keep it but it's not what the picture is.
Good but larger than I expected. This needs to fit very tight if you are using it for lap swimming.
Not as soft as I like.
"These are really lovely boots. The canvas fabric is sturdy but has no stretch, and the extremely tight spot at the base of the laces makes them unwearable - well for me anyway. Very disappointed."
"I like the proportion, & the fit with narrow torso for a girl. The quality is good, thick but not as soft as I would like, but it's cheap. After couple washes it shrink from size 4t to 2t. It still fit my 3yrs old daughter. She still wear her t2 shirts. I would buy it again with sizing in mind."
"The shoes are made really well, the entire thing feels like quality, the issue i have with it is the elastic that holds the tongue down is really tight, after about an hour of wearing it my feet became unbearable, which at first i didn't expect because the shoe actually fit me perfectly, if the elastic wasn't in there the shoe would be great.
The other issue i have with this purchase is the company, i requested a return and explained the shoe was too tight and uncomfortable and they sent me an email saying ""We would like to offer you $6 refund. Would you be able to keep it? Maybe you can resell it to your friend. If you do not want it anymore please send it back to"" now i don't even mind that i have to pay about $20 to ship it back because they refused to give me a return label, but seriously, offering me $6 to keep something i don't want or telling me to sell it to a friend, if i was told that in a store i would be pissed at whom ever said it, maybe don't treat your customers that way."
"Very light weight and comfortable, but the stitches are coming off already.  When my shoe bend at my toe region, it creates a large whole where the stitches used to be located."
"Would not recommend to wear much since the stiches on the side of the shoes came loose and had to cut them with small scissors. Overall, the shoes are cute but one of the small twinkle lights remains on all day even after cutting the little light switch off. But daughter does not seem to mind and continues to wear."
It's hard to judge the shirt as the sizing was very large. The thin material would probably be great for keeping cool and fast drying but it did not appear to have a very nice shape which may just be due to the fact that the size was so large.
I'm usually L size but this t shirts are way too long for me. I just do not like that.
"I think this wallet is great for younger people. I find it too small for most of my notes and extra cards. I love the print and the design, but my complaint is that it's so shiny that it looks really cheap. Like cheap PVC. If you are after something in a StarWars theme in a good quality, I would recommend checking out Loungefly x StarWars wallets. That is so much better. Cheers."
"These are very sweet, but run very small"
"wore down quickly and needed to go to a shoe repair facility. Cheaply made, but very stylish"
The bottom of the shoe is rounded which made my feet rock side to side. I'm positive that won't be great for running with flat feet with the ankle rolling in the first place. They were very light weight and breathable  I'm sad they weren't just flat at the bottom. They went back on the shelf .
"Bought is shoe for my son who haven't really worn it as yet but it fits abit too close for the size, was abit disappointed ........ so if you're buying be careful with the sizing ........ I expected it to be abit bigger that it was ....... the way the shoe was designed the front section for the toes were designed too short which throws off the shoe for its size."
Not quite long enough for a the size I picked. I hope they stretch a bit for my Husband. Otherwise great.
My baby is pretty small (6.5lbs) but these socks aren't small enough. They'd be great for a premie!
"This shoe is so beautiful, I waited for my size for more than a year. I ordered a 1/2 size bigger than my foot but the point still burn my toes. I'm still keeping it though."
The price is what attracted me - and I can see why. I don't think the quality is the same as the older version. Seems lighter. I like a heavier feel in my shirt. If you compare to RL way lighter. You can judge for yourself.
Fit was to tight for my husband had to send back
these boots are very cute but seem to be very short and very narrow
"Definitely best for slimmer legs around the calf, but with some wear they will probably stretch a bit. My husband loves them on me! I feel like I definitely got what I was looking for and the other descriptions were helpful."
nice warm up size is hard to fit for large guys
The shoes are nice but way too small. I ordered an 11 thinking they may run a size smaller but it was more like a size 7-8
"I guess you get what you pay for, because Im only able to wear about half of what I received. Either the others are too big ( size large)  or too small, and I am a size 0!"
"I feel like these are a get what you pay for situation. They are inexpensive covers for large tote bags that will keep your handbag dust-free, but I was kind of expecting a softer or more cotton-like feel to these bags--something more like what you get when you purchase a nice handbag. These will work just fine, but they feel cheap."
Cute love the way it fits and matches great with my earrings
Just a few things! the color of the dial is more black then blue.not like the picture!! the clasp is very flimsey.hard to adjust. Its a good looking watch but for every day use I don't know.seems like it would not take much abuse..
I've had a dozen pairs of Danskos all size 38. Some how these are falling off me. Very pretty but had to return them.
"I bought this skirt in a large which normally fits but this was way too small. I can wear a medium to a large but couldn't get it past my hips. I feel like this skirt would fit a small and maybe a medium if you're not to hippy. It is a very nice skirt. I love the belt-it's like a tarnished brass. It's very short and I'm 5'1"" so keep that in mind. I'm so bummed that it doesn't fit cause the quality is nice and it's really pretty but this definitely runs very small. I have it 3 stars because of the quality and the overall look of the skirt. I was sent this product at a discounted price for my honest review."
fits a somewhat larger breasted woman very awkwardly
"Decent buckle, but it's made from thin metal and has a cheap feel to it....BUT....it looks great and definitely draws attention when I wear it.

The best part of it is the hook for the belt holes. The hook has a ""ball"" on the end of it, so it pops into the belt hole and rarely comes out. Other buckles I have bought just have a plain hook and they constantly pop out of the belt hole."
It is nice but very wide
"Really cute swimsuit. Unfortunately, this didn't fit me properly. I don't think I have a long torso, but this swimsuit was just way too short for me. If I pulled the top up to a comfortable position, it gave me a wedgie. If I covered the bottom properly my bosom would nearly fall out. Otherwise, the individual sections fit me perfectly, just not long enough. I wish it did fit because it's super cute! I did notice that it seems to attract lint really easily though."
"First of all, I received this item at a bit of a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. So here it is:

The ring itself is very comfortable to wear as the polished and smooth comfort fit band is nicely done. However, I was very upset to see what seems like fake wood as the inlay. I know this product is described as real wood, but it seems more like it is a printout of wood and then heavily covered with tons of plastic. This results in a very cheapy feel...Even if it is real wood, it likely is a very thing shaving of wood. I think the description is very misleading and makes you believe you are getting a real wooden ring inlay surrounded by titanium. Anyway, I believe the price is fair what it is, just don't think you're getting an amazing deal for real wood and titanium ring. Another note, due to the excessive amount of plastic/acrylic my husband thought it was too flashy and fake looking. He too does appreciate the comfort fit band though. :) Also, packaging was awesome, very beautiful little box.

Conclusion: It is what qualifies as ""fashion"" jewelry, definitely not something that will last for years to come. So think of it as that and the price will be justified. Very comfortable to wear, unfortunately, comes off very cheapy due to amount of plastic/acrylic."
"My daughter needed it for a school show.  And she was very cute in it.  It seems well built, like it would last forever but it is polyester and we probably will never wear it again."
"I like the idea of this watch more than the reality, alas. I'd been looking for a casual watch that I could wear on weekends or out on casual occasions, something that didn't have sparkle or glitz and went with a jeans and t-shirts look. This fit the bill -- but wearing it just didn't prove that comfortable and trying to use it for its intended purpose hasn't been that simple.

As far as the feel and looks/wearability goes: I love the strap, which is thick and yet comfortable. It's nice to find a strap that is this comfortable, although I think that it's a bit short: I have a relatively thin wrist (on bracelet watches, I usually have to have pieces removed and the fastening adjusted) and yet this watch is fastened on the next to last hole, with no room for additional holes to be made. Something to consider for people with thick wrists. I did find the watch as a whole on the heavy side to wear, and when I had to change the time (flying back and forth from Chicago) I had a lot of trouble with the knob not doing what it was supposed to. More significantly for me -- and this is a subjective issue -- I found the broad contrasting stripes actually bothered me when I was trying to read the time. The hands of the watch are so narrow that they kind of got lost in the big stripes, and I occasionally struggled to tell the time, and wound up pulling out my phone to verify that I had gotten it right. Several times, I hadn't.

So this will take a back seat among my watches for the time being. I've been wearing it only occasionally, and pulled it out to wear again recently to be sure I had given it a fair try. I had..."
they said that the shoes would run small so I purchased them in a larger size but they are to big and I have a lot of room in the back.
But this is definitely for warmer weather- it arrives with a plastic band for your hanger to hold it but you will need to cut that if you want the shirt to fall off your shoulder
I find it awkward to use as a roller when fully loaded.  I end up pulling the suitcase behind me versus rolling it side by side to me as intended.
"These are very well made but run too small, so I had to return them. Unfortunately, they do not come in a larger size that would fit my son, so I was disappointed."
"It's ok, haven't worn it, but don't feel it is as described in the product information. It's smaller than I thought it would be, but fits fine."
"Not crazy about this pattern but I'm a huge fan of Freya after buying one that was extremely comfortable.  This one isn't as comfy as the first one was, but it has a nice fit and is OK."
The shoe was a little smaller than I'd like. I'm hoping they will stretch out a bit with some wear.
These are OK and seem to hold up well to washing.  The fit is a little looser than the Columbia boxer briefs.
"Update: Changing from 4 stars to 3. Noticed the stitching in some places has started to unravel. Taking a look at the other reviews, this seems to be a common problem. Too bad because otherwise, it's a great eco-friendly backpack.

I bought this backpack to use as a diaper bag. I was looking for one that fulfilled very specific requirements: moderate price, compact, lightweight, airflow back, at least 4 zippered sections, internal organizers and 2 exterior water bottle holders. After browsing through dozens of backpacks on Amazon and at stores, the Ecogear Palila Li has been the closest to checking off all the boxes.

It's smaller size makes it ideal for traveling and should fit under most airline seats (we will be testing this soon). It's material is lightweight so the entire thing weighs less than 2 lbs before filling it up. I didn't realize what a difference this made until I tried a Targus backback to compare. The Targus backpack was noticeably heavier even before I put all my stuff inside. Because I'd sometimes be wearing this backpack all day when out with the kids, I need it to not weigh me down.

The airflow back is okay. It hasn't kept my back from getting sweaty, but it's nicely padded.

There are 4 zippered sections: the largest ""main"" compartment has a section for your laptop (15-16"") with a velcro strap to secure it and a small zippered pouch. The next section is just one large compartment - no internal organizers, which could be great if putting books or in my case, extra clothes and snacks. The 3rd section has the internal organizer with 3 slots for pens/pencils, a little velcro'd pocket, a small zippered pocket, and an attachment for your keys. Lastly is the vertical zipper with a small section that is about 10"" high with a very slim/tight fit. I keep my antibac wipes and tissues in this section.

This is what I can fit into the backpack: the Brica diaper changer, sticker book, coloring book, crayons, 4 baby food pouches, 2 snack bags, 2 sets of toddler clothes, pen, baby food scissors, lotion, small first aid kit, eye drops, small pillbox, disposable place mats, bib, antibac wipes, tissues, my phone, sunglasses, and 2 sippee cups/water bottles.

Another useful little thing I noticed was I can clip my large claw hair clip on the handle on the top of the backpack and it will keep the clip from getting crushed. Speaking of getting crushed, the only thing I wish this backpack included was a dedicated fleece pouch for sunglasses at the top of the backpack. When comparing it to some other backpacks, this was one I missed and wished there was some way of incorporating it. One last note is I had purchased the exact same backpack a few months ago, but had to exchange it for a new one because one of the zippers broke, so we will see how it holds up.

I've included pictures of every section with and without my stuff. Really wished there were more pictures like that in the product image section. It would've been really helpful in my decision."
"way too tight. If you have narrow feet, you will be fine; otherwise, not so much. Had to return."
"The colors are great, but while some with large calves find these comfortable i find them to be very tight -- but useable.  Why is this different for me?  I do not know.  It might be because my legs are very muscular so the calves do not compress.  This may be a consideration for others with muscular calves."
"Cute boots for my size and price. A little uncomfortable for long periods of time, but still fun to wear."
I returned them only because the sole of the shoes are definitely not for hiking. The lugs are not gritted enough and for a shoes that that's called H2O Hiking Boot that's misleading. I didn't want to take a chance and slip in them and can't return. I was disappointed because they fit very well. So I'd recommend them for all around town walk.
"I purchased this for my DIL who is battling Stage III breast cancer.  Maybe it is uncomfortable with the port in her neck, but she hasn't worn it yet or commented on it.  It's cute, not the best quality, but would be cute on my teen granddaughter.  Doubt that I would purchase another one.  Sorry for the weak review."
"my son takes size 3, I got size 4 for him but it is the same size as his other size 3 shoes."
Good value for money. Will not work with polar vortex like conditions.
"I have had a really difficult time trying to figure out how to review this mascara. On one hand, it's not bad. It doesn't clump and it doesn't leave me with raccoon eyes or flakes all over my face. In fact, it has pretty amazing staying power; I've worn it all day at work and then in the evening through an intense workout and it didn't budge. Unfortunately, that is where the positives end for me.

The fibers aren't really that great for lengthening, and at times, they managed to get tangled in my lashes several times, negating the fact that it doesn't clump. Provided I don't have fibers weaving together, the look this mascara gives my lashes is a very natural, which is okay for daytime wear.

The mascara itself is a pretty dry formula, and after about 3 weeks, it was even more dry, to the point of unpleasant to use.

The formula promises to help lashes grow, but I didn't notice any growth, which isn't surprising given that generally formulas need to be applied at the roots of the hair in order to work...that's not easy to do with mascara.

Overall, there are some really great things about this mascara, but at this price point, there are numerous better options out there. I will not be repurchasing this item."
This Gold Stormtech - Packable Rain Poncho was bought in case of an emergency. I was disappointed in the fliminess but we'll see.
"Doesn't fit like my other bras in the same size.  The band seems just a little tight and the cups seem a bit oversized.  Very pretty looking, though.  Good under very loose-fitting clothing."
"For cheap character shoes, they're not bad. They are pretty comfy for shorter amounts of time. Main complaint is that after 2 months of constant wear, they are already falling apart, but then again, I do put them through hell. Kind of wished I would have saved up and splurged on LaDucas, but oh well."
"The strap across the front of the ankle is uncomfotable, cuts into the ankle too much.  Too far back on the shoe.  Should be closer toward the toe end.  Hard to adjust the velcro to get it looser in the front of the ankle without making the entire sandal too loose. Not what I expected.  The arch support could be better.  I have a very high arch as well as broken bones in my foot (Quarter horse stepped on it)  and finding a shoe that's comfortable is a challenge."
It's made of a parachute material that is really thin. My tattoos show right through so I have to wear a t-shirt instead of a cami.
Poor quality but then you get what you pay for. I was a bit disappointed.  Also runs small I normally wear medium and bought a large and it barely closes on me.
"Cute dress, very nice drape (heavy af), but the fit in the torso is odd - loose where the zipper is, but snug enough in the band above the zipper that I don't think I can get away with going down a size. Maybe meant to accommodate a body type that has a higher belly:ribcage ratio that I do, so if you're an athletic sort, look elsewhere for a flapper dress. To its credit, the beadwork and fringe are of better quality than the other, better-fitting dress that I ordered, so I'm sad about that."
"it is pretty, looks good also.  however, this bag is way too small. it can not carry even regular size of paper holder. and 15"" size
laptop."
Bought this a few months ago and it is starting to curl up which makes it impossible to wear under anything tight
"They are very cute, but not for someone who pronates inward, and has wide feet."
The waist is a little small. You may want to get a size larger.
They are very cute on but the left shoe strap hurts my ankle.
I'm a 9.5 and I should've ordered a size up.  Too narrow.
The quality is fine but it fits somewhat tight. I bought a 32w and it's a little tight. I think 33w is ok.
"good quality and beautiful, just a bit small"
"I'm not sure what it is but even though I thought they would be my every day sandals, unfortunately they are not. They are true to size, and the leather is very nice, however when I put them on they don't feel as comfortable as they look on the picture, I feel like I'm  walking in wooden clogs and they make my legs/feet look ugly, not flattering at all. Another thing, I have a bunion on my right foot, and somehow these sandals make the bunion look huge and ugly which doesn't happy with other sandals. So yeah, I wear them once in a while, but they are not my favorite shoes."
Great for earrings.  Only giving it a 3 star as one of kids was cracked.
cute but not the greatest quality.
"First let me say I love the shoes themselves, I have a wide foot so I'm a little picky when it comes to shoes, these fit great right out of the box.  Because of my wide feet I buy men's shoes instead of women's but can never find pink!! These ASIC's fit great and the color is awesome!  If I was just using them casually this might be a 5 star review but I put a lot of miles on my shoes and at about mile 15 I noticed a sharp pain on the inside of each heel. After removing my shoes I found that there was a sharp edge on the top of insoles was curling in and slicing my feet. Luckily I had some aftermarket insoles with me, I replaced them and was good to go for the rest of the weekend.

The moral of the story... Love the shoes, hate the insoles!  My advice... Just change those suckers out and you have a 5 star shoe!"
"Design of the shoe was great and the style was as it looked on the pictures. But, wow, did it run small. I normally wear a 10 so I ordered a 10 and 10.5 since it was free returns. I could barely fit my foot into the 10.5 and it was impossible to get my foot in the 10. If I had just ordered a 10 I would have chalked it up to maybe one bad pair but they seem to be a lot smaller than what the size indicated."
"I like it, however its to big to wear."
"Ordered TAUPE. Received OLIVE DRAB.
The color is definitely not a good fit."
"If I purchased a large, this would be one of my favorite shirts, and since they're so inexpensive, I'll probably just buy another one in a large. Normally I wear a medium. At some stores like cold water creek or old navy, I wear a small. This, my friends is not a roomy garment for American ladies. Just buy a size up from what you normally get and you'll be thrilled with it! Super, super soft, wash, dry and wear. It's great for jeans, leggings or a maxi skirt. So comfortable you'll want to wear it for pajamas! They run really long and could almost be a dress if you would wear it short."
"This Pj set runs large!  I ordered a medium, and the fit was more like an extra large!  I was also hoping the fabric would be softer, and maybe it would have gotten better with a washing, but I had to return it due to the sizing issue, so I can't comment on that."
"The fit was perfect when I first purchased.  Washed it one time and it shrank somewhat, not to the point of being uncomfortable.  I will probably purchase one size up knowing that this shirt will shrink."
Stretchy material feels nice but they're waaaay too big for me.
Ok but fits tight
These are cheaply made. Slightly better than dollar store. They do fit well and look nice but feel very flimsy
"My new jeans are immediately comfortable and cozy as I put them on. The material is soft and yielding and they feel familiar. Yet they give me a ""mom butt"" and fit very poorly throughout the thighs and rear end. I'm going to do my best to shrink them but, alas, they might end up being Stay at Home Jeans"
I like them the size is way off. I gave them to a friend and ordered another pair.
Material is very thin but they are mid rise.
"Did not like how they hit the top of my foot, maybe for a more narrow foot"
Fit was GREAT until dried.... It shrunk a ton in the drier. Can't wear it anymore
"fits very well, a legitimate size 38 waist & 31.5 length. had them professionally washed and pressed, lhung dry. let's see how they do in the dryer! they are just chinos, and cannot be dry cleaned, so practically speaking, if you can't machine dry, they're really not much of a buy even at the price I paid. an aside - I had put 3 pairs of this same model - 8036 - and the price went from 19.99 to 26.99 since my purchase. what's up with that?!"
These were likely not genuine birkenstocks. They were much larger than my directly sourced birks in this size. I replaced them with ones from the genuine dealer and noticed that the footbed lettering on the fakes was more printed on than stamped in. The sole was shiny plastic that did not match with genuine new birks. That being said they are pretty good fakes and you may not notice the difference
"Muffin top still pokes through but that is not the jeans fault.  I thought if I bought the size I always get they would be a little big since they were ""boyfriend"" jean. They fit the same as my other jeans maybe a tad smaller.  Good length."
Flemsy plastic and cheap construction. Lights and sounds are cool however. Would not purchase as a gift becsuse it looks like something from the dollar store.
The crochet sleeves are somewhat stiff
"Love the fit in the waist,but way to baggy in the legs."
I love the dress other than it being to long. It's great quality and the color matched the picture.
"Nice skirt, modern and interesting looking."
Looks great only problem is the fit
"Received them quickly. I guess I hadn't noticed the ""relaxed fit"" in the description. I wear a size 8 and these should have just been labeled a wide. The quality is poor. Little to no arch support. The faux leather looks very cheap. The ""memory foam"" in sole feels soft, but with no arch support I would have to add an insert. Did not meet my expectations. The style is cute, but that doesn't make up for the other issues...."
"the boots arrived quickly, they had a very heavy odor but that went away fast, one shoe feels a bit wider than the other but over all the boot is comfortable and I was glad I had them for my winter event."
need a better size chart for customers
"Little larger than I thought it would be. I'm about 50 inches at the widest part of my hips/thighs, but have a smaller waistline. Was just the slightest bit too big, but I like it. Not very functional for actually holding anything up, but it serves the sexy purpose :)"
Too narrow in toe area....
color not the same instead of the redish brown its a plain brown
I love them they are great and very comfortable.
"Great shoes, just the right foot did not fit , was just to tight at the top."
Really no complaints . I do prefer a thicker material but that's not a dig . Just thinking out loud....A good seller with no issues during this transaction....
"These are really cute on my 15-year-old daughter, who likes to wear them to young around the house. She say they're very comfy. But the pants are too long on her (she's 5' 2"") and she says they're to wide at the bottom as well. Also, although the quality is okay, it's not great enough to justify the price."
"This is a very cute shirt, but runs VERY small. Order a size or 2 larger than what you usually wear. It is a thin t-shirt material, but is not see-through."
shoe is much much brighter in real life.  Comfortable fit but slightly large.
Not my favorite.  Material is kinda cheap for the money.  Thin.
quality isn't that great..! just ok
They were OK but there was only four holes for toes not five!
"Really thought Gerber would have been small but this is really long, my daughter is 7wks old and still hasn't been able to use the 0-3mnths but its really nice"
Not nearly as warm as I'd hoped and a few of the edges around the wrist are already starting to fray after less than a month. Really disappointed with what I expected from Isotoner.
Ordered a half size smaller because a lot of the reviews said they ran big. The toe piece seemed too far back at least for my foot otherwise they would be great.
"As of right now, they're great for the price, noticed some of the orange thread is loose/unraveling but for the price we paid not bothered by it. We'll have to see how they hold up."
"Please be advised - this is NOT a sweater as it says in the description. It's made out of t-shirt material. I'm not crazy about it since it's not what I expected, but it looks ok to wear on a completely casual day."
OK shirt but tight at the wrists.
super cute. love these
32 waist size seem smaller than normal
"It's great to hide your fat under tight dresses or other outfits. However, it does NOT make you curvy or skinny ladies. I wear it after workouts to give my body somewhat of an hourglass. I workout 4 to 5 times a week plus the waist trainer. The waist trainer alone will not help you lose weight AT ALL If you want to wear it as a corset under your outfits to give you a more defining look, go for it. This is for you. It isn't worth the price though. FAIL"
"Jeans fit expected, but they came in with an odor and it took 2 washes to dissipate the smell."
"Okay as a sunscreen but not a great moisturizer. It does have a ""lightweight lotion"" texture as the description says, but it didn't absorb easily so it felt heavy on my skin. Also it's not good for use on eye area; if I sweat a little or my eyes water, it gets into my eyes and burns."
"Fit and finish were excellent.....However,I don't find the heel-strike is up to Ascics standards...These were not expensive shoes.....A factor which plays into the heel impact...."
"For the money I guess they are okay.  They are very soft and comfortable, but I have not wahed them et so I don't know how they will be after be washed several times."
They feel Great but the size chart is wrong
Did not live fabric
This was cute. You get what you pay for I guess. The class was very cheap and broke as soon as I tried to put it on. Its ashame I couldn't wear it because it broke.
fit is wider and shorter than expected
"Liked the color, shade and material. But it's a bit small for me. Covered only the neck and a little above the chest."
"This shirt wasn't exactly what I expected but its still not bad quality the sleeves are weird feeling and not as long as in the pictures. Has a few loose strings. I am a Small to a Medium, based of off other reviews I ordered a Large. Its loose which is what I expected and it fits perfectly! Loose enough for my comfort but still stylish."
"There are 4 strings that are so long they could double as a scarf. The arm length is good for long arms, but the chest is baggy. The double hoods are pretty messy looking. For the money, it's not that bad. I'll wear it as a work shirt, but def have no plans of wearing it out."
Dye runs alot from the material!
"I haven't had the opportunity to wear it yet, (wedding in NOLA in May) but I'm a 38F and this is a little roomy in the bust even on me. I bought a 2x, however, I'm sure an xl would be too tight. The arm holes are also roomy, but the dress flows nicely, fits at the waist and is just long enough on my 5'6"" frame."
Definitely oramge. Very inexpensive. Unfortunately they look rather cheap too. Not worth postage 2 send back. Will probably wear them at some point.
"If you are used to slippers with a hard sole, like me, then these slippers are a kind of disappointing. If you only use them during the night going to the bathroom or in the morning go to the shower, they are fine, but don't use them for a longer time. Your feet will hurt; no support!
The first pair fell apart after 1 time use and was replaced at no cost! The replacement is okay so far!"
"I ordered these socks b/c I had some gold toe socks that I loved and wore until they almost disintegrated.  I thought these would replace them, but they did not.  These socks are just average cotton socks, nothing great.  And they shrunk a little after washing.  I finally discovered the Gold Toe socks that I used to own and loved--the ""acrylic"" gold toe socks.  They are stretchy, soft and warm.  I found them in a Gold Toe outlet store.  I highly recommend those.  So, I recommend the acrylic gold toe socks, and I do not recommend these (the cotton ones)."
These are adorable but they wouldn't fit my daughter which is strange as we have other L&L's in the same size that fit just fine.  They were tight on her feet and she doesn't have wide feet??
"It looks like neon coral, I kinda don't like that! However I'm 130 lbs, 5'6 and ordered size S"
"So far I am so happy with this set. I'm traveling in a week and was able to fit in everything I need, with room for my purse also. It is very sturdy and appears to be very well made. The price was excellent with Free Shipping.

UPDATE: Main Zipper BROKE...Co WOULD NOT ACCEPT A RETURN. I wouldn't advise this, The zipper also broke on the 2nd set I purchased."
Tarnished really fast and leaves a green ring on my finger every time I wear it.
"nice fabric and not crazy clingy like many pattyboutik tops. It is a bit too long, however, so not as flattering as it could be."
"Slightly smaller than epected, Hopefully will adjust in time.  Always wear a 42, but each style is different. I should have returned for a larger size. Otherwise, a nice bra."
"I bought this bag because it was part of a lightning deal, and I got a good price for it. But I wish I'd never bought it. There were plenty of reviews that said the bag stinks on the inside - smells like fish. Not everyone had that complaint, so I took a chance. Well . . . mine STINKS! I've got tea bags in there to hopefully draw out the smell, but I checked it recently, after two weeks, and it still smells. I love the bag, and I really want to use it, but I get migraines and smells like that give me headaches. I'm going to try Febreze or something next. Hopefully, it works."
Not too comfortable. Hope to break them in.
"Although these pajamas were very pretty and the material was nice and soft, I had to send them back as they were too tight across my stomach.  If the fit was satisfactory I would have kept the pajamas."
"The leggings are to big and they ride down, see thru, and over all poor quality. I ordered 2 pairs one in white amnd one in black. These leggings are good for staying at home or wearing them as long Johns. I ended up using them once and putting them in the goodwill pile. I should have just paid a little more fore a more expensive brand. Disappointed"
The jacket is very beautiful and very light. BUT there are many places where between the seams sticks out fluff. I pointed the arrows at the photo. I also didn't like the big space around my neck. The jacket does not protect the neck from the wind.
This robe is cute but very short. Perfect for lingerie but thats about it.
"I originally purchased this set strictly for the posts and not the rings so my review is only based off of the posts. They are a little thicker than the standard stud but not much. I love the screw on back and had no issue putting them on or taking them off. The only thing I wish that was different about them is that they be shorter in length. They appear to be the standard length of any normal stud but since they have a screw on back rather than a push on back, I can't pull them close to my ear. There's a lot of space on the post behind my ear that throughout the day eventually slips forward and I get the look of a saggy earring. That's the only reason I gave it 3 stars compared to 5. If they fix that one issue then it would be the idea stud set for me."
Due to difficult time to get out of drive licences.  It easy to hold without loose receipt with zipper. It is fitting large purse.
"a little too big for my size i chose, which is size 7. It's slightly larger than normal 7s."
"It's an ok pin, but it looks better in the photo than in person."
"I wanted to love this, but the underwire poked all the way into my armpits.  Well made and looks nice but it'd be great if a bra maker made larger cup sizes for petite women.  I'm small, just large chested!"
"Sadly I found this device uncomfy

It did work, just not very comfortable"
It's Okay because I need some things to wear.  had I tried it in a regular store I probably would not have purchased it or I would have tried the next size up.  I will leave it unbuttoned and wear a kami under.  It is long enough to cover my bum!
"Cute,  but the lights on one of the shoes my daughter got for her birthday doesn't work. I asked if this is just a battery that needs changed but it doesn't seem that there is a way to change the batteries. This is a big flaw for a kids toy."
Looks some what cheep.
"The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because it's not one size fits all. It fits me like a dream because I'm at 36B, I wouldn't recommend it for anyone larger than that. Super cute and stretchy. Very comfortable."
"For a 6X, it runs very slim cut. Pretty dress, but not sure it will fit my daughter... whose entire wardrobe is size 5/6.  I will be returning this as she won't like it tight."
"Looked really good for about 2 years, then the choosing on the ring started to flake and peel off. The base is the same color, but no where as shiny as the coating."
"These boots are so beautiful, although they have a very strong plastic-y smell. I had to get them out of my closet because all my clothes started smelling like deep plastic.

The sole is a little slippery, but I guess it comes with having plastic boots. Since they're all plastic, they can get very cold in the winter, so you better get some long winter stockings, which will also prevent them from moving all over the place when you walk, since they're so tall.

The quality is okay. But, by the third time I wore them, I realized that the logo on the back of the right boot came off from one corner, that's a bummer, especially when you're buying Ralph Lauren brand... In addition, the belt on the left boot came off of the button holding it in the back, so now it's tilted to one side.

In the end, they're beautiful and they keep your feet dry... but, that's it!"
Glad I ordered large! It was still too small. Cute though.
The cloth is so soft and amazing but the Stitching isn't great.. I had to sew it at few places that opened up. Still works good.
"I guess the saying is true and buying cheap can be a bad thing. In less than a year, all of these socks are nearly gone because of holes in them."
...if this beanie had the 'lip' like the NEFF type would get a 5STAR rating and would of course FIT AS EXPECTED ..........
not that well constructed has already snagged.
This belt is too long.
"I tried on a pair of these Bobs at a local store before ordering.  7.5 fit perfect.  These 7.5 Bobs from Amazon are HUGE.  I'm not sure why Amazon's 7.5 Bobs fit differently than Bobs in a store. ???  Anyways, I ordered size 7, and they are too short.  Apparently I need to purchase these in a local store rather than Amazon, because I'm not quite sure where these shoes are coming from.  The shoes are cute in appearance and super soft sole, which is why I still gave them 3 stars."
Too small but very pretty. I messaged the seller asking for a size 12 in the brown but never heard back.
Cute and soft but the top of the hood was very pointy..not very attractive to wear on your head.
"The XXL fit like a womens L  & fits long, before washing. The fabric is thin, but the design is original & fun."
It's O.K.
"Three stars because they're just okay. You get what you pay for, right? The major drawback with these sunglasses is that the nose pieces rattle and the entire pair creaks when you put them on."
"I'm a true 8.5, ordered a 9 and it fit pretty snug. The material is nice, the height is great on my 5'9 frame, and the fit is comfortable. The reason I returned is the look. The ankles were a little too large for my taste and they scrunched up a lot with every step I took."
"It looked like great coverage, but it didn't prevent bouncing when jogging.  Returned"
Justin makes a decent boot.  Nothing fancy but if you have wider feet or in between  make sure you go up one size to accomodate for the narrow toe box.
"I ordered the biggest size they had. It fits, but a little snug. I love the fabric, cool and stretchy."
"If you lace all the holes it can get pretty weird, the tongue it seems is not quite long enough. I roll my ankles easy so for years I've always worn high tops and it's helped a lot. It's hard to find ones I like but these are pretty good. My only issue is that when tying them to the top the lace gets a tad shorter than I'd like and the tongue tries to take a dive."
With a low heel you would expect comfort this shoe is very cute but very UNCOMFORTABLE after just a couple hours of walking my ball of my foot hurtled so get a ball insole if you purchase these
Very long compared to shoulder and bust size-(too small of a bust with regards to length and width of bottom).
"Size was on point. I'm an 8 and the 8 fit well. However, I could not walk in these. They were super awkward and I couldn't walk my normal stride. Weird boots.
But they were cozy and felt comfortable on my feet."
Fits true to size don't listen to reviews like I did. Had to return
Purchased this while ago in Medium and Large for my Mom and my sister. They look very nice in person with nice and vivid color. However they run small and don't last long. Heel part moves around and it had lost its cushion in just a month of daily use.
it is ok comfortable. but if a few more lbs it will be tight
"Disappointed in the chain, it's too short. The pendant is smaller than expected."
"Construction was well executed, but my ""change color saphire""was lavender and not anywhwere the shade of blue shown.  While pretty, just was not the color I needed for this specific gift."
"Way too small yet I asked them in a larger size. Good product and warm, but think buying them in adult size in S for big boys."
"Material is very thin. Not like my other MH pants. Waistband is too loose to keep them up, and there is no inner drawstring. Returning them."
"These sandals are cute, I love the sparkles, but they gave me insane blisters on my Achille's tendons from the first wear. (I hate it when that happens!)

The coral color is cheerful, and the sparkles just make these shoes extra sweet and happy.

I normally wear a 7, and I bought a 7. They fit just fine."
Nice shoes very comfy on the bottoms of the feet but just a little to small around the toes. Had to painfully break them in a few days and still wear bandaids to help. I do have very flat feet though. But besides that I like these shoes
"Pick a size smaller based on comments and it fits fine.  Love the outside shell.  My complaint - different from most others is the liner.  I bought this to wear over sweatshirts, sweaters, etc for outside work in moderately cold weather.  I wanted a shell that would slip on easily.  NOT!!!!  I saw that it had a polyester lining and hoped that would be slippery enough to slide on and off easily - NOT.  It caught on any sweater or sweatshirt I wore.  But I loved the other aspects of the jacket.  After close inspection, it appeared I could simply cut out the liner.  this worked!!  The pockets still work, hang down a little, but are fine for the occasional use I need them for.  Now I love the jack - just wish it came with either a nylon liner or no liner."
Runs a bit small but ok for the price.
Go ahead and purchase the full Invicta kit.
"It was a little tight across the  chest, even though I went up a size. I was hoping that the tab could be secured under the collar when not in use, but that was not the case. For me, I though it looked weird just hanging down like that. It looked great when you had the collar up. I returned it."
"Too small for me passed them on to my daughter who liked them, although she said the cut felt a little 'off'."
"This hat had no size information on the webpage, but beware it is an X-tra large. I was disappointed when it arrived."
"My toes emerge out of the top of this shoe like they have no place to go. It's a cute style, but the very front of the shoe is incredible narrow and doesn't seem to make much sense. It should be just a little wider and it would be a much better design. It makes it look like the size of the shoe is much too small; however, if I were to get a larger size the shoe would not fit me and it would gap in the back. Very odd design!"
Snagged the first time she wore them. Very pilted after washing.
Fabric too thin.
"Had to return, very cute though!"
A perfectly good T-shirt but like the other one it is smaller then the size I ordered. So just make sure you order up if you choose to get one of these.
"Adorable and just love this pretty dress on my 5 yr old. Ordered 6 and fits my small 5 yr old, as I  expected. 3 stars due to quality only. so many compliments."
I didn't care for the fit or material.
They get run lines in the legs very easily.
Loose balls.  Lasted a month and took a month to ship.
sent it back because it was smaller than expected.
Love the color but they were a little smaill
"Very difficult to clasp but once fastened creates a muffin top because it stops midwaist. Oddly, I with the shortest waist on the planet, wish this was longer. He benefit of posture correcting is overshadowed by the self conciousness of the muff top."
"i really liked them, the were very comfortable out of the box. however, after a day of normal use, i had a rather large blister on my little toe  - of only one foot. something about the way the shoes sat just wasn't quite right. really wish they fit better, i really liked them."
"They don't match up to the 501's I have that I've boughten in stores, material is a lot thinner ! Not near as rugged.. fingers crossed they last stand up to the old ones.."
"I absolutely love these shades, but the nose piece plastic fell out  I have them a 5 star at first, but just after a couple of moths that happened."
Looks strange on.
"I had these in my shopping cart and save for later for months before I went ahead and bought them.  I did order a half size up, but I think that is common when wearing an open toe heeled slide.  It is winter here in Ohio so I haven't worn them yet.  But, I did walk around in the house in them for a bit and they seem like they will be rather comfortable.  They look a little ""plasticy"" brand new out of the box, I image they will look more natural when broken in."
I bought these for my 4 year old granddaughter who absolutely loves the color & Frozen. The hat was too small so she didn't get much wear out of it. Little disappointed. She has a small head & petite. Personally I would go up one size.
wish I would have tried these on first. they run small and narrow. I will give them to someone that can wear them
it was small fit and right at the edge not my preference how it looks. the sandal its fine I just did not like how it looks
"Everyone keeps asking me why I'm wearing my pajamas to work. I gave up wearing them to work and just wear them around the house. FYI -- the material is a bit thin, I wear my white cuddle duds under them."
Too large for my foot.  Well constructed.
"Top feels wonderful.  Material is nice and feels warm. Top fits great.  I would have given these a five star if the bottoms were not low-riders.  They are at least 2"" below my waist and not comfortable at all. I am not 15 and do not like low-riders!  I will probably keep them and just wear the top with other bottoms. Will not order again unless I hear from them that they are making them with higher waisted bottoms. I could find no way to contact them."
It is ok for a lightening deal
Zippers are not smooth and the bag is smaller than I though? I like it and have been using it daily I just wish it were larger
they are very cute . but fake NOT REAL TOMS
"Way too small, its so short in the torso that my breast rest completely above it and it hardly reaches past the bottom of my ribcage which is where the cups sit when i try to put it on. Very disappoiinted at how oddly short it is."
"So if you don't wear a belt, you are wearing a huge garbage bag -- not exactly my style ! With a cinch belt and tucking though, it can look kind of cute, and you can move comfortably in it, so I'm keeping, but just barely. I feel it's about $15 overpriced. Would value this as a $10 item, but I'm keeping because of the color, and I know I will get good use out of it ..."
Even the size 8 is still a bit small. Inside feels warm though.
t was not the cdolor in the pitcure so iwas not happy with  it so i gave it away to a friend
"I own several Patty Boutik tops but this is not one of my favorites. I purchased a small in Olive Green--I'm 5'1, 135, 34B. While I would say it fits true to size, the material is thin and tends to cling, while the neckline is a bit too low for me. It's suitable for wearing underneath a puffy vest, but I had originally purchased it to pair with a skirt or dress pants to work and it doesn't quite work for that."
"I was disappointed with the color of the stones on this ring. The colors in the rainbow stone aren't pretty at all. The stones on the side don't complement it either. But the setting is gorgeous, so I gave it three stars for that. If there's a color of stone that you'd like, and you like large rings, this style would probably work for you."
"Very unconfortable in the groin area. I stand at 5'8"" and this costume was still too small for me."
Not the quality expected. Lining was not as dense as expected.
Shipping takes way too long. Nice dress.
"Undershirt is needed while wearing!  this very beautiful very flowing, & Very see through"
"nice looking well made, just not realistic for fit according to the sizing.  Ordered 38D got more like a 38 C minus.  Disappointed"
"I am a 5'5 115 pound female whos size is small/xsmall in womens.
And this was waaaaay too big, too long and too wide, asian large.
I am getting a US x-small/asian medium in the mail and will see how that fits.
I liked the color and material, however it was too big."
I bought a 1/2 size bigger and they just ran too narrow that they didn't look good on me.  I loved the style and look but just not for me.
These are novelty leggings at best.  Cute and fit the bill for an ugly sweater party ensemble but they are pretty see through and would best fit a size 10 or smaller.  They slide down constantly  because they are a very slippery material.
This was a bit tight and my other bras the same size fit fine. I like the color and style.
Nice Belt but the end is hard to insert through the belt loops.
Purchased XXL and it fit more like an XL.  Hoping it doesn't shrink!
"Its pretty and nice for summer, but the side splits are way too high for this to be a modest dress."
"These are comfortable for ballet flats, but beware these do not fit like Lucky Emmie Flats from other retailers do.  I've bought two other pairs from Dillards and TJ Maxx and both fit the same with tighter elastic on the sides (as shown), but both the size 8M and 9M pair I received were not like that.  They feel stretched out and looser overall.  The footbed is comfortable though, so if the looseness fits, go for it!!"
"This shoe didn't fit me as well as I hoped. Since I have issues with socks, I run/walk without socks. This shoe has zero ventilation regardless of what the description implies."
"I'm not sure if career changed anything with these jeans, but I can buy them at the store and they fit different. I've been wearing 40x30 and 42x30s forever. Bought 42x30 tag says 42x30. They fit tighter than any of my 40x30s and the pocket openings are smaller. I can barely get my hands in there. Looks like I will be paying a couple dollars more from now on and picking them up at the store."
Had to return to small for my boy
"Good material, cute sleeves. Color is very bright, red-orange. Not a cool color.
Runs small, even for fitted or body-con. I'm a size 10 and L was too small, so the front flap and seam didn't sit right, and the shoulders were definitely too narrow. In the photo I'm pointing to where the seam should be, and it's 1-1.5"" off.
Anyway, if it fits, would be a cute little dress. Waffle-knit fabric makes it sturdy and a little unique."
sad little pin
"solid quality, but they fit strangely."
"I don't think I have huge wrists but it looks small on me. Much smaller than the pictured example.

The band is pretty awful. It's made in China, and it feels it. Not really even interested in breaking it in. I'm replacing it, if I keep the watch.

The second hand is off a bit. For the money I guess I cannot complain too much. I read the reviews that mentioned the same and hoped I wouldn't get one with this issue. Just kind of shocked that Japanese QC lets that through. Says made in Japan, but I've read that they -might- be pieced together in China. So that could be it. Probably not worth the return game to get one that isn't. Just unfortunate.

 Also probably wouldn't have bought it if I had known it didn't have a screw-down crown.

Registering the warranty gets you another year of coverage - but it really doesn't cover all that much. The power cells in these do falter, and fail just like watch batteries. And the general consensus is they eventually outright fail, over time. So the never ""need a battery"" thing appears to be marketing at its best. They simply haven't been on the market long enough to really have empirical evidence to back, or disprove the claim. This IS or IS NOT covered in the warranty, depending on who you talk to. Having an eco-drive properly serviced can cost as much as this watch. Something they want you to do every 2-3 years in order to keep with warranty requirements. Meaning that is you cannot prove that you have done so, they will likely not cover your claim and charge you instead, Another thing I didn't know about before I bought it. My mistake."
Kind of loose on the feet. I don't really enjoy wearing them because they are loose.
"I really wanted to love these but had to return them..twice. First pair was too wide and my feet slipped out of them. Second pair wasn't as wide but the left shoe was bigger than the right shoe. I would still recommend people trying them since they are super cute, with proceeds going to a great cause, and for some people they work out. They just didn't for me. Amazon makes returns super easy so I tried a couple times to make these work. So sad."
"The boots were comfortable but not a wide calf as advertised.  At least I wasn't able to wear jeans inside and still get the zipper up.  I wanted to love these because of the two tone, but ultimately I sent them back."
Larger than n a normal sixe 13
"I've worn the Supernova models for 15 years at this point as a runner, and I did wear these out just like I do all my Supernovas, but the glue they're using to hold them together is not as good as previous models and the sole also didn't seem as durable- I feel like these were toast after only 200 miles or so instead of my normal runners' rule of 300-500 miles per shoe. Was glad when model switch for the next year happened."
Don't like the way it opens up so wide.  Would have liked to to be more compact.
tried out this wallet elastic strap just about worthless after one week. hard to get cards in and out looks cool but I'll stick with chrome products
"Beautiful watch, very esthetically pleasing, and feels great in the wrist. Only problem is, the deployment clasp is nearly impossible to open with my hands/nails that I have to use a small sharp metal object very carefully to open it; huge inconvenience."
"I bought the Blue-purple set.  The dress looks just like the photo.  It is all cotton and not stretchy at all.  The top detail is embroidered, the skirt detail is painted on.  The sleeves are stretchy velveteen and soft.  There is gold lame trim as shown in the photo, except on our dress the waist trim is pointed down, like elsas real dress, not straight across as shown in the photo.  Overall the quality of the dress seems to be good and it looks just like the photo.  I am a little concerned about the zippers as they seem to get hung up when crossing the gold trim.  If this listing was just for the dress, I would give 4 stars.

However, the cape is nothing like the picture.  The photo shows a long cape, and the cape we received is barely knee length.  This is a huge disappointment for my daughter who wanted a long cape like Elsa.  It does have a pretty jewel at the neckline and it fits nicely over the shoulders.  There is a navy/black appliqu around the shoulders, and the detail on the back is just painted on. It is very very lightweight and the edges are not hemmed, they are serged, which makes the cape look very cheap.

The gloves are stretchy and have glitter detail on them.  They run very large.

The crown comes in two pieces and has to be assembled.  It feels like it could break at any moment and I have had to reassemble it every 5 minutes or so.

The dress runs small, in my opinion.  My daughter is a very very small almost-3-year-Old and 24lbs and 27.  I bought a size 4 and it fits here perfectly, but there is no room for growth.  The dress hits her at her ankles.  The gloves run huge though and can fit me.

She loves the entire set, except for the short cape part.  If I had paid in the $15-$20 range, I would have considered this 4 stars, but for the $25 price, I think the accessories leave a little to be desired."
They were smaller than my smaller size.  They were real narrow too.  Other than that (which is important) they looked and felt good.
Don't buy it if you have small tata's!!!!!!!!!!  Makes me want a boobjob though because it's SOO cute!
"This is such a cool watch. When I got it I was breath taken upon opening tho box it came in, even though I had looked at plenty of pictures online. The pictures online just cant prepare you for the real thing. It looks so modern and original and high tech, yet has a relatively simple design. I was skeptical of the Chinese Seagull movement, but it does look beautiful in person and I was pleasantly surprise to find that the movement is hacking. It is very heavy too, which I really do enjoy, it feels very solid!

Why only 3/5 stars? Because of the fit and accuracy. The watch is made for big wrists. Android customer service will tell you that the cuffs will overlap for smaller wrists - and they will, but not far past 0.5cm. I can still wear it, and do, but a better fit would be nice. Maybe if future generations of Hydraumatic watch came with a set of smaller interchangeable cuffs a wider variety of customers could enjoy it. Also I expected better accuracy from the mechanical movement, I loose about 30 seconds a day, regardless of how much I wind it. I know the Seagull movements are inexpensive Asian movements, but I have a similarly priced mechanical Miyota that looses about a minute a week.

Overall a very cool looking and feeling watch. I'm very happy I got mine."
"I bought these on a Daily Deal so the price was good.  That is about the only thing I can say about these that is good.  They are cheaply made, cheap material.  They feel fake, like they are all plastic.  Not worth the return, these will be in the car as backups."
"He quality is really good, fits well and is warm. Though I am giving only 3 stars as there was a manufacturing defect in the pair I got, one of the glove fits just fine and the other was so tight that i could not even get it on; I returned it."
"These glasses are fairly heavy. When I wore them this summer, they kept slipping to the bridge of my nose. I can't wear them while driving because they'll fall off and it's not easy to continually push them up with one hand on the wheel. Very stylish, and I love how mirrored they are! But The weight of the unsupported lenses makes them hard to wear."
"Usual Gerber quality, they fit my daughter as expected and are really cute. I would have given 4 stars but the bibs are way too thin and get soaked quickly."
"Bought these for a very specific purpose along with a few other options and these ended up getting returned.

To be clear, nothing wrong with them, just not quite what I needed."
"Even tho they are gorgeous, the material is really hard and not confortable at all. I was hoping they were so i could buy more, but not buying any more of this brand."
"These are cute, but would be better for a person with narrow feet up by the toes.  The picture makes it look like it would definitely cover the top of foot, but below the pinkie toe wants to pop out.  I thought there would be less space between the front and back of the shoe.
Also, they are much more casual than dressy."
Good surprise for my 6 year old but the jewel has that fake metallic crap on the back which makes it look cheap. Otherwise it looks and feels nice
"Great look, very comfortable however soles wear easily with daily wear, Lasted 6 months."
thought it would be bigger
sleeves run small ok ...keeping
"This is will be the first watch of this brand that I have given more than a star and I have bought several of them as gifts, for sale and personal use so believe me when I tell you that all Akribos watches are bunch of JUNKS (I put it in capital letters so you won't miss it.cos if you go ahead purchasing their products you'"" definitely regret it). It's either we have been getting a knock off item or a very poor quality replica because I can't comprehend why a company would intentionally make very poor quality watches and be cool about it.

I gave this particular watch out as a gift and the person really loved it. It's a beautiful watch I must admit but can't trust the durability of the materials used neither the brand as a whole. I hope it does last the test is time.  I have quite a number of their watches and all made if stainless steel have eroded."
"I took the advice of some other customers and purchased the medium as I am a size large. The fit is extremely tight. It does suck it in well, but is so difficult to put on. I am going to wait on wearing it until I have lost a few lbs. Otherwise it is as stated..a great waist trainer. Also it is very stiff and not for use during exercise. Driving was a bit uncomfortable but nothing major."
"Hurt my shins
Great on the feet"
I can get the dress to zip up but because of where the waistline sits I look nine months pregnant. As I loose weight I feel like the waistline will look better.
"I am a petite 4 and these are too tight and uncomfortable to wear.
I also thought they would be warmer"
Pretty decent. But not that comfortable.
"They are the correct size, not small as other reviewers said. They were definitely too big for anything other than a first hole.

However they are extremely pale. They basically are clear. While this can be a deviation in stone color in tanzanite it certainly didn't have the brilliance I was expecting, even at this price point."
They're fine cuz they were cheap but he jewels are put in poorly/sideways so they don't look right.
i love the style and color
"Smaller than expected, after wearing them a few times, the back part around the ankle became disformed and dug in making them uncomfortable"
"The images show that the two lighting bolts are hung with one facing the direction as does an ""S"" and the other like a ""Z"" so on the ears, they would frame the face.  The pair I received has both in the ""S"" direction, so I have reversed one.  Since I needed to use my needle nose pliers to manipulate the metal wire anyway, I opened both and added a couple small beads on the wire loops to give the bolts a little something more.  These are very small, extremely lightweight, and because they are sterling silver, they are very malleable.  If you give these to a young person, be prepared for them to be frustrated when the wires bend in a way they don't want.  For an adult, this may be a problem as well, so just be sure to not push too hard when trying to get these into the holes in your ears."
"The fabric itself is nice, light and breathable. The zippers are cheaply made though and take forever to get zipped up - not ideal for activities where you want the bottoms to convert frequently."
Unfortunately it looks cheaply made for the price
Good color nice cut shittie material.
Too small to what I expect so I returned it.
Size is good but the 2 pockets sewn in thru the middle take up all the interior room so I picked the stitches out & removed them now it's perfect
"Love these! Can't beat the price, and they look fantastic! I have to wear studs for work, and these are perfect.

Update:  The post of one came off and I'll need to Superglue it."
"My first koh koh dress and I'm not impressed. I'm 5'3"",135lbs, 34dd, and wear an 8. I ordered the medium and it was tight in the chest, shoulders, and sleeves. Much too small for my bust and broad shoulders but perhaps would work for someone with a smaller frame. The style made me look pregnant and the material was so thin that I could see my nude colored bra through it! This was definitely returned. Maybe I'll try a different style of koh koh dress in the future but never this style again."
I almost bought these but the same day I tried them on my mom got the exact same pair at Kohl's on clearance for less than $40.  I couldn't keep them at that point based on principle.
"This dress s cute in the picture. It's not bad on, but I'm 5 ft and it was longer than its suppose to be since I'm short. Other than the length it wasn't bad, but the cross over the chest looks really odd on me because I'm also big chested. I sent this back."
It's ok. Would not purchase again.
Serves its purpose. Smaller than I anticipated.
"Just bought and washed these pants and I like them enough to not send back. I am very picky with the fit of my pants. I ordered a size 3. I am 5'6"" 145lbs. The waist and legs fit great but the knees are pretty loose. (maybe just the pair I got?) Quality of the pants are what I expected for $17. I wouldn't say they are super stretchy but they do have a little give to them."
Quite large for a baby size.  MY son is almost 2 and they don't stay on his head yet.
"Too big - had to return.  It was also thicker & bulkier than I expected, so I didn't reorder."
it was ok i love the bathing suit but i was kinda small on me
Comfortable and fits as expected but sole wears out quickly. For the low price it's ok. This is my second pair and I would buy again.
"I already own a Citysafe 200 (which I had to modify--see my review ""Coulda, shoulda, woulda"")&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pacsafe-CitySafe-200-Anti-Theft-Hand-Bag/dp/B000ZPR3FK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pacsafe CitySafe 200 Anti-Theft Hand Bag</a>, but I wanted something smaller for use around town and perhaps on shorter trips.

The Citysafe 100 has all the positives of the bigger 200 purse--steel wire in the handle, steel mesh in the body, well-constructed, heavy-duty fabric. But it is considerably smaller and lighter.

In fact, it is almost too small, and I must agree with other reviewers who wish Pacsafe offered something in-between the 100 and 200.

The outside end pockets on the 100 are so small and so tight that they are useless except for perhaps carrying pencils or pens. My very thin cell phone does fit--however, once in, it is hard to get out because the pockets are so tight.

There are no other outside pockets. The 200 has a large outside zippered pocket (actually divided by stitching into two useless small pockets, but the stitches can be removed.) This purse has nothing like that and that's too bad, because an outside pocket would allow you to carry tickets, brochures, coupons, etc.

As with the bigger 200, I am considering making some modifications to the 100, which would include mesh water bottle end pockets with cord locks. I did this to the 200 and it was very useful on a 10-day trip to Paris. But once again I'm wondering why I have to make such heavy-duty alterations on a new purse."
Hard to read due small width and scribbled writing.
"very narrow, a bit clunky as well."
"The front is really cute. The way the fabric drapes is very flattering. The back was the problem. It was super tight back there,a bit sheer and very clingy. I returned it- and if you have any bits you don't like in your back, I would recommend ordering a size up."
You get what you pay for. Very thin material but cute pattern.
Great sweater but the lights did not work.
"Made the mistake of getting this from a 3rd party seller, Really dissapointed in the quality :("
They were beautiful but I ordered them my size and they run small. Keep that in mind when you order yours.
"It was pretty, but way too small.  I gave it to somebody I thought it would fit.  I don't think they make sizes as big as me.  I feel like a giant.  I wear US size 8."
"Originally ordered on 06/04/18 and worn almost every day in our pool up until this weekend (07/29/18) when a large hole developed in the back of the shorts. Gave 3 stars because before it began snagging, which is where the hole came from, my daughter loved the colors and style. She is wanting me to order a new set but Im not planning on ordering this one again since it really only lasted 2 months."
This fits like its for a plus size woman.
"The bottoms fill up with water on the butt area because the butt was simply too big, the top fits amazingly though so I'm wearing the top with a black bottom from an older suit."
"A strap broke on first time wear, but they're pretty for the price. I'm gonna wear them anyway"
"Well the slip is comfortable and light to wear, but I was disappointed that it doesn't help in make the skirt of my dress 'slip' smoothly over the fabric. So my skirt still gets bunched up a bit, which is frustrating since that is why I purchased this. Slips are a bit of a new venture for me, so maybe I'm missing something....:oP"
they are more denim looking than I would like and don't breath as well as some of my other sanuks. I like them but I don't love them. Took a while to break them in where as my other CASA's were remove the tags and go.
"It's an ok fit and I like the blue color, also I like that it has short sleeves.  However after one washing the stiching is coming out at the bottom."
"Fits well however, the quality is not that great. The zipper is broken already and I don't think that I will purchase another one."
these boxes are very small should have read the dimensions but even so I was able to make use for them.
I really like the shoes but they we're the wrong size. I called to get the right side but they didn't have my daughter size. I appreciate all the effort in sending them on time
Ok but to narrow for my feet
A very nice looking classy shoe. Good quality. Problem I had is they are a bit tight on the sides as well as instep. I'm normally 10 1/2 M which is what I ordered and they were uncomfortable after about 2 hours of wear. J&M shoes of the same type I have fit perfectly. I currently have shoe stretchers in these shoes and hope it eases the tightness issue. I would have returned for a 10 1/2 W but W was/is not available for this model.
"I love the fabric, the light removable pads, and how the cups are set apart, but the vertical seem below the armpit was a deal breaker for me. I found it to be completely uncomfortable. Perhaps another style would feel better."
Works so-so. Have to use polishing cloth in conjunction with to polish it nicely.
"These shoes are super pretty, but not comfortable at all. I am planning to wear them as part of a costume, and the look is PERFECT. So pretty and exactly what I need to complete the look. The price made these especially attractive since I don't wear shoes like this very often. Who wants to pay a lot for shoes you won't get much use out of?

I'm sort of dreading wearing them for a long time, though, as they are a bit unsteady and a little on the narrow side. The 4"" heel feels even higher, for some reason, and there is very little support for the foot. The toe area seems more narrow than I'd expect, and I know it's going to rub when I wear them. I see myself with some very sore feet after the event I'm attending. Guess I'll have to pay the price for fashion, though!

ETA- I did wear these for an all night event, and they did not turn out to be nearly as uncomfortable as I had dreaded."
Not bad running shorts for the price.
"I really love the shoe, but the fit is concerning."
"The open toe area wound up being uncomfortable because it crimped my toes.  I would skip these, and just buy the 'sleeve' compression socks."
Fits a little large but I like it as it's comfortable.
"This is a nice deep red color and has about a one-inch heel that is fairly padded.  I needed to order wide shoes because I had foot surgery a few months earlier and the swelling has not gone away.

Even the wide width was pretty narrow.  I would say that the wide is the same as most regular width shoes.

The sandal upper is fabric and its style is very casual.

For me... did not fit well and too casual for my purposes.  This might work great for women who do not have a wide foot and are looking for a casual weekend sandal."
SERVE IT PURPOSE
"Love, love htis item!! fits perfectly, great feel and look!!!
it gives me free movement yet dries really fast after my workout!"
I love this and would've given it 5 stars but the quality is so poor. The latch broke after one day. I will find a way to fix it because I love the look of the bracelet.
"i ordered the 8W - i usually buy 8.5, but i needed the extra width.  i did not feel any extra width with the W, and the shoes were longer than the 8M.  i'm keeping them because they are so cute, but disappointed with craftmanship on that aspect."
These earrings are very cheaply made.  The post bends just putting them on and taking them off.  You get what you pay for though.  With that said not bad for the price.  They just have to be babied.
this necklace arrived as described. The charm is very lightweight. I was expecting it to be a little heavier. The black cord that it came on is twisted so the charm continues to twist around so you can see the back hall oh. Instead of the part that has the faces on the Sun and Moon. I'm going to have to find a way to train the cord to not twist so this doesn't happen. I have a similar necklace that I bought at a festival that is of much better quality. The charm is heavier which keeps it facing the right direction.
"These are not as nice as they appear, the longer ones don't tighten very well and the piece with the clasp is too small. Out of the 4 only the skull piece fits comfortably and holds."
The arch support is great.  Wore them for the first time today.  When I took them off I noticed between my big toe was red.  Just a matter of breaking them in.
The shoulder strap broke the first day. It is a cute bag. Holds a lot. Will be a great overnight bag. The straps were big enough to use as shoulder straps.
"These are perfect. They are a little differant than pictured. very lightweight and comfortable to wear. The earpiece is straight across
not curved as shown in the picture. The gold is wearing off after only 3 times wearing these..."
"Part of me wonders why Amazon Vine keeps offering me clothes way out of the size range I indicated on my preferences, but I'd guess that might be for family members and close friends to try them out. In any case, size medium wasn't too far fetched for a loose, floaty style like this, so I sprung for it. (BTW, if Amazon has their headphones on, medium or large in a junior's line with its smaller, different proportions usually fits me just right.) This size and style hangs loosely, but it's not ridiculously voluminous around and not too long.

Although I imagined blush would be a peachy color and not red flowers on pink background, that's partly opinion. I discovered the flower print and camel tan pants created a nice color palette; any intensity of almost any blue would look good, too. The entire top is very see-through, so minimally you'd need to wear a cami or tank top underneath, or a lightweight long-sleeved solid color jersey as I did. The loose flowing sleeves with no way to gather them in to your wrist and secure them are my major point of contention and I need to ask why that style? Recently the fashion world has featured a spate of sweaters and jackets without buttons, belts, or sashes to keep them closed. Possibly to save a pittance during production, gain a few pennies at retail by not adding buttons, buttonholes, a sash, or a belt. Before I wear this top again, I'm going to gather the sleeves onto a band (probably not elastic) so they don't flap around in such a silly manner. And the price is way too high! This is the type of thing you'd pick up at the corner bargain mart because the flower print was cute and you easily could afford $6 - $7."
"So, I want to start off by saying that Cobb Hill shoes are stupidly comfortable (and what I mean is they are VERY VERY comfortable). These are no exception. They have nice cushion and arch support. The issue is the fit. I'm a pretty solid size 9 and can sometimes wear an 8.5 depending on how wide the shoe is. I ordered these shoes in 8.5 Medium width and they were a little too narrow and long. I think an 8W would be perfect. I have an 8W in other Cobb Hill shoes and they are still a little floppy, but a 7.5 W is too small. So, if you can find the right size, you will likely love these shoes. They are attractive and the color is a bit more vibrant than the red seen here, but not very bright."
"Very comfortable, too small for people with ticker legs."
Wasn't my style or fit.  Made me look wider than I really am.
Pretty but sequins itchy
"To be fair, I think the problem with these might be me, not the boot.

I have a lovely pair of Keen hiking shoes (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/KEEN-Women-s-Logan-Outdoor-Shoe-Neutral-Gray-Hot-Coral-7-5-M-US/dp/B00RLV26YO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">KEEN Women's Logan Outdoor Shoe, Neutral Gray/Hot Coral, 7.5 M US</a>) in my usual 7.5 and I have no problem with them. With minimal breaking in, I wore them on a 2 week trip to Iceland with no discomfort.

For these boots, I followed the size-up advice and went with an 8. The 8 fit very well, I'm glad I did not go with my usual 7.5. The right boot was great, had me very excited. The left boot though, was very uncomfortable at the top. Feeling around the top of the boot didn't seems particularly stiff or anything, but nevertheless it was very noticeably poking me. The only way for me to avoid it was to not lace up the top holes, which somewhat defeats the purpose of the boot for me.

I'll allow for the possibility that I have a preexisting invisible bruise, but for now, these are going back. I do love Keen though, so if these go on sale in the future, I might retry them in case it was just a quirk."
"I am 5'9""

They are too short. Only go down to my calf."
"Well made product,  just too small"
"If you want this shirt to maintain its size, DO NOT DRY IT! It will shrink."
Plastic feel. Not as expected but will do in rain
"I am glad I ordered a wide width! They still really rub your toes and the buckle bites! If I'm not wearing them a lot, it's fine. But I don't see myself wearing them to work, which was the original plan."
"Almost loved it.
This bra is comfortable and beautiful - BUT I returned it because the apex of the cups is VERY wide set.  I am normally a 36DD and ordered this in a 38DD because of reviews.  The band and cups fit me perfectly, but it felt like they were so wide set that they pushed my girls under my armpits.  This is the design of the garment.  If you look at the model photos, all of the models look like their chest is wide set and it completely eliminates cleavage.  While the bra is comfortable and made of great fabric, I returned it for a different style as it was not flattering at all once I put my shirt over it.
comfort= 5 stars
sizing=sized small in band and cup =2 stars
material= 5 stars, well made
fit=  1 star, not flattering unless you want wide set chest

overall= 3 stars if it works for you and you size up"
Easily mis-shapen and the silver tone wears off in about 2 months
Didn't keep these socks. The sole is much too thin. Seemed like it would rip after one or two uses. Going to spend another $10 and actually get a water shoe instead.
"love love this shoe but it is for wide feet, the strap has velcro that is not strong enough to keep the shoe on as i walked the velcro came apart.  it had to be returned for those two reasons otherwise it is a very pretty shoe ans it is pretty well made. the size is true if you have wide feet."
"They rubbed on big toes and caused ""cuts"" so I am waiting for them to heal, they are very beautiful shoes.  I said ""somewhat small"" but I think maybe it is just the new leather rubbing against my toes that is causing them to be uncomfortable."
"I bought the large in this blouse, it fits ok a bit roomy, the medium would've fit perfectly. I am 5ft 5'' and 120 lbs normally a small in everything fits. The product description says cotton blend, there isn't an ounce of cotton in this material. It is sheer like and very thin. I will have to wear a camisol underneath. The design with the animal print brings off the blouse, overall it is not bad BUT there was a tear in the blouse, which means it wasn't stitched properly. I'd give this 4 stars but because of the tear in the blouse and the description which says cotton blend which isn't true i'll give this 3 stars"
"The light blue bottom was very weird combo for the shoe. Was looking for just red, white and black."
"The shoes fit fairly well, but had a cheap quality that was not altogether unsurprising"
"I liked this shirt ... until I washed it.  It shrunk so much that I had to give it to a friend who is smaller than I am.
Other than that, it's cool."
"Ordered a size up based on reviews, but it barely fit over my boobs, and totally unflattering around the belly. Returning, but buying in a larger size or two...
Beautiful shirt, comfortable material, and seems durable as well. Good thing I plan way ahead, so I can get another larger size before baby comes! I'm 20 weeks, and barely showing, so pregnant belt had no bearing on size assessment."
"I wanted something for a VERY particular use.  I monitor stream salmon in very dark grey weather.  These are not good for this use.  The polarization effect doesn't seem to be strong.  The glasses them selves seem sturdy enough (definately better than others flimsy ones I have used).  Based on reading, they likely work for night driving, I just don't ever use glasses for that."
"Length was okay but the leather was too tight at inside curve before the toes. Potential risk of bad blisters.  I did not want to take the chance of having the leather stretch and still having it feel tight, therefore returned it."
Just exactly the color I was wanting and wanted to love them.  A bit too short in length and a bit narrow in width.  With that combination there was no way they would ever feel comfortable.  I will sell them to a consignment store or donate to Goodwill.  Shame...  it took them 2 months to get here. Nice soft  material though.  I ordered the largest size available  (9 med) which is about a half size larger than what I wear.  The Chinese sizes tend to run small. For only $20.99 not worth the cost to ship back.
Material is kind of itchy.
Has sewn in pads and they are very flat not conformed so make your breast look odd. Wish pads we're remove able so I could purchase good ones.
As advertised.  Very helpful.  Would expect a much higher quality product for the price.  If I were to purchase these in a retail store I would never pay more than $6-7.
"The fit is just odd.  Kind of feels like clown shoes because they are too tight around the ankle/instep and too big around the toe box. I love danskos, I own 3 or 4 pairs and I'll continue to try their new styles out each year, but these aren't working for me. The leather and craftsmanship is excellent as I've come to expect from dansko."
Sizes are off a bit.
"I expected the shoe to be light weight, and like running bare foot. I like the product but am not sure why it is so expensive. I have ran in the 3 times and I am already noticing some thinning of the top of the toe area. I am afraid they are going to have a hole soon. I wouldn't care if they weren't so expensive. I would expect more durability at this price."
"Fits appropriately and doesn't look too bad with casual clothes, but really loose around the ankles. The real problem is the pain my toes were in 10 minutes after walking due to tightness. They feel tightly squeezed after only an hour of standing. Will have to stretch the front area to make comfy and spacious especially for thick socks."
It is a very good looking watch but it is not made in Swizerland so you are paying more for the Ferrari logo than the watch itself .
"Fits way too small, order at least two sizes bigger.  Look nice though."
I liked the pockets and color of this dress. The way the front is cut to allow for nursing is just square and funky. I thought the fit of the skirt was more moo-moo ish than I expected from the picture.
"The earrings are pretty, but they don't always stay close."
"I really like how pretty and elegant the bracelet looks, but unfortunately it snags clothing very easily.  It snagged my brand new sweater as soon as I closed the clasp and was lowering my arm to my side."
"I was a little disappointed that the large didn't fit. I am normally a medium, but sized up after reading the reviews. When I got it, it was so super tight, I had to squeeze into it. Luckily I bought it as a pajama shirt, so I wasn't too worried about it being tight. It loosens up after wearing it and it is definitely soft. It is also fairly sheer, definitely would need an under shirt if I were to wear it out in public."
"Only gave this 3 stars because it was obviously 'used'. The wedding band was beautiful and not a scratch or scuff on it. The engagement ring was another story. The bottom of the ring had obvious wear and the silver was duller than the other ring. The box also had a date hand written on the bottom. Other than that, we're very happy with the set. The fit is right on and the stones sparkle better than natural diamonds. Not too huge that it looks fake but not too small either. Even with the negatives... I'll be buying a few more sets in case something ever happens to my original set. At first i was disturbed about having someone elses engagement ring but then realized... Its what the rings represents thats most important."
"I read the reviews. Please read them before you buy this. It feels like you are wearing absolutely NOTHING. Ladies, it looks that way too. Except for the 'hold'. There is no padding, and it is fine for around the house, but I feel awkward wearing it outside. There is just too much 'movement'. lol"
There doesn't seem to be allot of arch support. It would have also been nice if they had memory foam.
"I tried these on and washed them and wow, they come out crazy wrinkled.  I haven't even worn them yet, as they need ironing or steaming.  So much for comfort pants, you need to do lots of work to make these look good!!  :/"
"These are decently made sunglasses for the price - similar to Target quality, however, I definitely feel like in the bright sun they don't allow the best visibility compared to my other cheap sunglasses from the actual Target store. Ha. I find that annoying so I can't say I'd really recommend them unless you just want to look cute."
Just OK. Nothing special.
Nice heavy ring.  It's ok.
Fits a little large and is thinner flimsier fabric than I expected.
It's a very nice scarf but not as soft or luxurious as I expected for the money.
"The hood of this sweater comes to a strange point in the back so every time her wore it, it looked like he was hunting Orcs in Middle Earth. I've never seen anything like it."
"Nice booties, great quality but very narrow"
"I really liked the feel of these briefs and I especially loved the low rise waist line. They fit great before and after washing. My only complaint is that the legs are very short and if they are worn during exercise or a run, the friction can become very irritating so I deducted a star.

I took off another star because I asked the vendor for a longer leg version of this same brief. I was directed to a version of this brief with a longer leg that turned out to be nothing like these briefs, except for the material. The other version has different seams which ride up your back side, a higher waistline which I hated, and they don't come in black. Basically, NOT the longer leg version of this."
It will not keep you warm by itself but combined with another hat it really helps. Kind of annoying to use because of the nylon material being slippery smooth. My skull caps have a tendency to slide of my head! Glad I bought a couple but the price I paid seems to be high in my opinion. These things shouldn't more than 3 or 4 bucks if you ask me!
Kind of disappointed but really I got my $ worth versus paying a mall kiosk to replace it.  Give it a try.
"Size was a bit wonky, but for the price I cant compkain a ton. The back wouldnt even Velcro shut (my husband has broad shoulders, but still wears an XL top). The pants were HUGE, as in baggy. Wish they would have been more fitted like the tights in the movie"
Way too big!  Almost a full size bigger and wide toe area.  I wear a 9 1/2 or 10 but these were just huge!  Cute though.
"My husband is 5'7"".  I bought him this fleece to wear at work when the office gets cold.  The jacket fits fine through the body, but the sleeves are a little short.  I bought him the medium.  I wouldn't recommend it for anyone taller than my husband. It was a good buy for the price though. Where can you find a fleece for $20?"
"These are handsome, well made shorts that were NOT comfortable.  I have a number of these shorts in the ""non-Oxford"" fabric that fit pretty well in size 38.  Other reviewers said the Oxford weave ran small, so I ""sized up"" to a 40, especially since I've added some pounds of late.  The shorts arrived and looked GREAT - the fabric looks a lot classier than the regular polyester .  They fit fine in the waist and were even a little loose - BUT they are WAY shorter in the rise than the non-Oxford Haggar shorts... If I pulled them up to where I normally wear them - at my waist - I gave myself a severe ""wedgie.""  VERY disappointing because they look so good!!!  They're going back."
"The shoe is durable and looks great on the outside. However, it is very hard and not breathable. It makes the feet sore and damp after a couple of hours."
"I live in Florida and need to wear black to work.  These are perfect. They don't stretch as much as I thought they would, but are great anyway.  I'm very tall, so they are a bit shorter on me.  But overall, they're fine"
Really cute shoe but it is extremely narrow. Had to return couldn't get my foot in the shoe and I wear an 8 in every shoe I own.
"Planned to have as a dressing outfit but it came too large for an M, so its now a sleeper"
"Another adorable dress from Fiream, this one my 2 year old granddaughter picked out herself and was so excited when she pulled it out of the bag! 100% cotton, wash in cold water, dry on low, so easy! This dress is the perfect weight for desert living late fall through early spring. If you experience cold weather, match the dress with warm leggings and cute boots, your little one will be dressed to impress and so comfortable!

I highly recommend this adorable dress to anyone with girly girls in their life. Simple A line, perfect for toddlers through grade school, going to play clothes or going to school clothes! The appliqu is attached by machine and is well lined. The price point on these dresses cant be beat. I am very happy with these dresses and I think you will be too!"
"I wear Heals everyday, and these ones feel like slippers right out of the box! AND they don't make a loud obnoxious click noise on tile floors. I am going to order one in every color!!"
"Comfy, pretty and stylish. The only downside is that it will get dirty really soon. Mine from 1 time wear it looks worn out for more 20 times. Runs a little bit larger which is good."
a little big but comfortable.
"Love them! Look good on, can wear all day!  My go to walking shoe."
"I love Clark shoes.  It's sometimes hard to find a good shoe online because I wear a wide but Clarks always seem to fit.
They have good arch support, last a long time and are super comfortable.  This is my 4th pair of Clarks and I'll buy them
again and again"
Love it..... high quality and worth the price
Like it soft comfortable attractive
"it's OK, worked as a prop"
"A good name brand shoe online is apparently something people do all the time. we had to take the plunge and I think it was worth it. they fit well, have lasted so far, and look good."
"This outfit is cute if you can pull it off! It's in Chinese sizes tho, watch out! But it's very stretchy!"
Great shoe as always!! Love Keens.
This jacket is very good.like this gift so much
The medalion is a little smaller than normal; almost more for a child than an adult.  But I like it.  It's dainty and simple and have received serveral comments and it's only been a week.  I am not one to take my jewerly off when it's an everyday type; so we shall see how the brilliancy lasts with showers.
"They are so comfortable and keep my feet dry at the same time! I will get more when I need them.
The price is high but there worth it!"
"Great skirt, looks good with leggings or bare legged with boots. I order one in every color."
Nice heavy duty watch. Hubs loves it
Perfect for a pendant watch.  The chain is substantial and will not easily break.
"These fit great - no break-in time, fit my feet perfectly, and they look great, too. Very good support - can wear these all day!"
"The snake head was a little cheesy, but overall, it's nice."
Amazing coat.. It really should be listed to compete with way more expensive active coats that are resistant to rain and wind.
love it!! I've had it for a year and it's worked great
Perfect to wear under my dresses and skirts so I don't have to wear panty hose.
My daughter loves these and has had many compliments
This product was everything it was advertised to be! I could not be happier! Thank you for pulling through yet again BodyJ4You!
It came pretty fast and fits my daughter great
"This is my second pair of gladiator crocs.  These are somewhat smaller than my first pair.  Still love them, very unusual looking."
Beautiful workmanship! My husband loves these shirts. We have blue and black and going back for another color.
incredible look for the low low price. My niece was indeed the belle of the ball in this lovely dress
Amazingly comfortable!
Great!  Was just as stated.
This is very soft and comfortable
"light weight and works well, great jacket!"
"Just what our Frozen crazy 3-year old granddaughter wanted - she would wear only this all the time, if we let her.  Good quality, pretty Elsa and Anna!  Soft comfortable fabric."
My daughter loves these for middle school track. SO much cheaper to purchase online. The spikes are great and she has done well in these shoes. Great purchase.
Love my new ring! I got the silver and absolutely adore it!
This was a great mask regarding quality and fit.  The ties allowed us to help the mask fit comfortably.  And the look was as dramatic as we were hoping.
"I love the texture/simple knit design/ribbing. Arms fit OK but body is way too big. Can be worn with leggings or pajamas.
Really lightweight so I might bring this sweater along on trips"
"Exactly like the picture.

Except the stone is a little lighter in color"
I bought these for my daughter.  She really likes them.  The Birkiflor is a real durable material and can withstand the rigors of water and dry like new.  A great style for her too.
"I was a huge FJ fan, and now I think I will switch!  Very comfortable and easy to clean.  Played in the rain yesterday, and my socks never got wet."
"I own over 15 watches and like to remove/adjust bracelets myself, and replace dead batteries when needed.
This kit contains more tools than I can ever expect to use. Some tools are an absolute necessity, while others are for occasional jobs.

Even if this is not an expensive item, being made of plastic, etc. it's still very much worth the cost.
Just using once or twice already paid for itself - instead of paying the local jewelry store.
I strongly recommend this purchase. It is definitely not a dissapointment."
My daughter loved these! They fit perfect
I did not have any luck finding golf shoes locally and I wear Asics for walking long distances so I decided to try these. The first day I wore them playing golf walking and pushing a cart they were so comfortable I didn't even think about my feet which is pretty amazing considering I have had foot surgery and still have lots of issues with foot problems and pain. These did the trick for me completely!
"This was one of Amazon's Deals of the Day, so the price was good.  I've only worn these boots once--very comfortable, good fit, lightweight--and I think these waterproof boots will be most useful for rainy days, snowy days."
"This  is a wonderful dress, fit as expected. The customer service is the best! The dress is beautiful and I'm very happy with this dress. And very fast shipping and the best quality, I recommend this wonderful dress."
This is a beautiful wig!
"Shipping was SUPER fast... Especially considering it came from overseas. I normally wear a small, but I got a medium and it fits perfectly, so size up for the best fit. Overall very cute and exactly what I was looking for!!"
"These are just what I was looking for to wear in my first hole! I wanted a simple, shiny gold look for daily wear and these fit the bill for me. They are a nice size but not too big- just right,"
These pants are so cute. You don't see this style very often. But they do run a bit small.
Love these knee high shoes. They are so comfortable and very cute.
"I wanted to have socks that were more appealing than the typical black or brown I normally wore.  Since receiving the hipster power socks, I do feel that my clothing appearance is more complete.  The only reservation I had initially was how well my feet would feel when I went for my daily walks or hikes in the mountains behind my house.  I can now report that it is more comfortable to walk/hike in these socks than the thicker cotton knits I was wearing previously."
so in love with this watch. I have already referred 10 people to the site to get one. this is lightweight and i get complements all the time
Great pants.  Good price.  Lightweight for those hot days.
I'm not sure I love the pocket
"I have always had a perfect size 7 foot. It's like shoe manufactures used my foot as a template for a size 7. That's why I get irritated when a she line doesn't fit.

This shoe fit perfectly. It is very cute. It is a day into night shoe. Looks nice with jeans or skirts. Very comfortable."
These are a fabulous casual Espadrille.  I found them a little bit larger than my standard 7.5 size but as long as they do not stretch I am happy.  Love the raw canvas look.
This was a gift for me and I love it!
We have been wearing these boots for a week. So far no complaints. Comfortable and warm. They come in Medium size and I was concerned because my toddler wears Wide. He doesn't seem to mind at all and runs in them freely for over an hour.
a good staple for layering in the fall.
"They fit perfectly, not too small at the opening... not sure why people were saying that! So far, so good :)"
My favorite pair (and i have a bunch) love the pattern/ fit. Very flattering.
Very comfortable & good for most chilly to cold days. Sporty & can wear anywhere.
"The box is great! I tried it on and it looks adorable. The chain is nice too, very sparkly! I'm giving this to my best friend who has five cats, for her 42nd birthday."
"I loved how soft and comfortable these pants are that this is second pair I buy!  Nice enough to wear to office. Wash great. These have become my new favorites.
I hope Stylzoo offers pants made of this same material but not as wide pant legs and more colors SOON."
"The seller said these are hand measured and might be off 2cm,  well they are and my foot in a 9,  is all the way up to the top and bottom.  Why not carry larger sizes or fix the problem,  because they are very soft and feel comfortable,  otherwise."
"Lovely, cool dress.  Thank you!"
Mediums usually run big or perfect on me this one is a little snug. I've been trying to dress a little prettier for bed and this looked perfect. It's pretty and cotton but a little snug.
"Purchased so many from other choices on line trying to find the right size and fit, right style and cuteness and almost gave up when I decided to give it one last shot before I headed to the store to pay much more than anyone needs to.
So I gave this a shot and boy, am I glad I did. This is all that and then some. I purchased the tortoise because I plan to have my transition lenses transferred and I find the dark lenses look much cuter with a brown frame.
I have a broad face and these are just the right size. Not consuming  nor conspicuous. They just compliment. I also tried them on my sister who has a much narrower face and they are also perfect. So they will work for anyone. They seem very sturdy and do not look cheap at all. Famous brand names have only one thing one these...their exorbitant prices, which we do not need.
I am  recommending these with all my heart. I want all of us girls to look really cute when we step out."
This coat is so cute on my 1 5month old daughter.  The furry part is very soft and the hood stays on nicely. She loves wearing this coat.  Nice fit.
"Shoes are a little less comfortable than other skechers I have, but I still like them.  They are lightweight and seem to wear well."
get compliments when I wear them
"so far so good---as described ---perked up motorcycle  saddle bags and waterproofed ---used it on boots, chaps and whatever other leather i have and everything is good"
"good quality, but it is too big for my son(12 year old)."
Run smaller in size than I expected! Buy a larger chest size if you want to wear them over other clothing. SUPER WELL MADE CONSTRUCTION
"excellent quality, beautiful colors and super comfy! perfect slippers for any little doc fan who wants to be comfy cozy!"
The booties are beautiful.
Like the skirt but like other reviews said there is only one thread holding it together so I re stitched it to be on the safe side.  I was prepared to do this when I ordered the skirt.
These sandals are as light as a feather.  The memory foam makes them quite comfortable.
"They are so cute, every time my kids wear them people ask about them"
Great all the watch fit perfectly!!! Highly recommended!!!!!!!!
"I think it looks great, and the material is what I was expecting as well. The only reason for 4 stars is that I actually ordered this in white and they sent me black. It's not the end of the world, and the black looks good, so I didn't bother trying to do a return. I'm happy with the black too."
My son likes the style and fit
"Fantastic suitcase. Firm, strong, durable and rolls easily. Not heavy at all and the zippers are very secure. Took on a long tour through Europe with a lot of slogging around. Came home in great shape."
I managed to get everything I need including cash and license in this very small case.  It is my all time favorite for when I just want the essentials.  I even have a small pen refill with tape around it for case and some cc sized blank note paper in it.
"I purchased the teal colored leggings and they are really cute.  The color is true to the picture and perfect for livening up a drab winter day.  They are super soft and comfortable and I will probably wear them lounging around the house just as much as I do going out.

They are fleece lined, so nice and warm for the winter (and not see through).  They fit snug as leggings should, but are stretchy so perfectly comfortable and not so tight that they look indecent.  The waistband is high enough that it flattens my belly and gives me a nice silhouette in them.

Sizing - Im a 5/6 , 135 lbs and 5 5 tall, these one size only leggings fit me very well.  They aren't too tight and don't give me muffin top.  They are a little bit long, but not enough to look bad at all.

I received these at a discounted rate for my honest review.  This did not affect my rating at all, I really do love these."
A great product to help keep things organized in the suitcase!
"Just the right size for folded shirts, t-shirts and jeans. Along with small cubes for socks and underwear they make living out of a suitcase much more convenient than without."
kind of smelly when first purchased.  so you need to air it out for a few days. My son ended up not wearing it and my wife wore the hair. Its very versatile.
Thanks you very much
Just returned today.
It's cute and functional but does require a separate credit card holder.
These shirts are great quality - run big though
"For anyone looking for something slightly different than the norm, this hat is for you. You'll feel  'jaunty' the minute you don it. It fits true to size and will keep the top of your head warm!"
Very good size.
just totally cool with a lot of quality thrown in to the mix
"These boots are very comfortable, stylish and warm.  I am very happy with this purchase!"
Fits true to size. I ordered up (medium) instead of small based on other reviews. Going to order another in a small. 5 foot 10 and 140 pounds.
My husband loves this shoe...always buys the same time when the old one gets worn out
Great color and decent quality!
This was adorable.  I got so many compliments.  It's just sexy enough without looking like you're walking into a bedroom.  Suitable for a fun Christmas-themed event!  It is a tad itchy though.
These a small black socks. If you need small black socks you should buy these socks
"A bit on the small side but I figure they should stretch out ..will give a more detailed summary in a few weeks, I'm in South Texas by South Padre Island - we can dress in shorts into December."
Very comfortable and very cute. Great for my SC weather.
"The waist seemed a bit large on my husband. He's got a 33 in. waist and I ordered a medium. There is an adjustable belt. The fabric dries quickly and seems strong. The pockets are great, a nice zipper one held his ""water proof pocket"" when we were snorkeling. Great as swim trunks but also have the look of shorts."
Exactly as shown. Quality material
"My husband and I each have one for traveling. We both love them! They're spacious and have the expandable zipper if you need a little more space. The inside is actually made of 2 compartments, which is perfect for separating clothes from shoes/toiletries/etc. I love that it rolls and still has the handle across the front for easy lifting in and out of trunks and on and off the conveyor belts. We took these bags on our long trip to Brazil and the bags are still in terrific condition!"
Love this skirt! It will be a staple in my closet.
Love these flip flops.  Very comfortable and easy to walk in at beach or the grocery.
"Be sure to order these boots 1/2 to 1 size larger than usual.  They run a little small, but are super cute and sexy!  They are comfortable for several hours but not if you plan on walking all night."
"runs a bit small, and I am size small.... other than that, very pretty"
"I like that the hem is a little different, but you have to wear the right pants with it."
"4 stars for now since I just got it and walked around the block. The heel is the bulk of the feel right off the bat.  The measurement feels true.  Gonna break it in some more and I'll update it. Awesome so far.

UPDATE Dec 20, 2015
I had to update this review.  in regards to the lacing system, mine came with regular laces and not the quick lace system everyone is whining about.  I would've replaced the laces with regular laces anyway.  I've had these boots for a couple of months now and I must say, these are fantastic.  I've taken them on weekend hikes and most recently, to El Yunque rainforest in Puerto Rico where they performed flawlessly.  They were comfortable all around, great ankle support, waterproof as heck, and took everything the forest threw at it.  They have very good grip but there were some cases in the forest where these didn't help with traction(to be fair nothing would've lol).  But that wasn't a deal breaker at all.  i was dreading the 2 hour hike back downhill but the heel part of the boots finally made sense.  It gave you better control and support and put less stress on your knees which was great.  Highly recommend these and after i go through them i will most certainly without a doubt get another pair.  And so now we face the winter and will update on my winter hikes with these.  Cheers!"
"Cool and comfy, fits nicely....I like it a lot.  Wish it was a little easier to get off and on to use the restroom, but that comes with the being a romper.  Great for an evening out on a HOT Vegas night."
Such a cool shoe and people love the cork. This is my fourth pair of Puma EL Ace and by far my favorite.
"Fit well and dry quickly. The length is short, as expected, but not too short. I'm 5 ft 5 in. tall and they fit a bit above the knee. Overall great shorts."
boyfriend loved the first jacket I got him.... it was black and orange. so I got him the one in all black this time so it goes with most outfits :)
"Long time fans of Doctor Who will rememeber K-9.
My friend loved the tie tack pin!! She knew him immediately!!"
Absolutely love these boots.  Fit is great and no break in time. Comfortable and look great!
"I bought this type of item a few years back from this company and it was GREAT! I see the price went up and the material is not as bullet proof, but it's ok for some motorcycle riding in the winter."
Fits me well.  Happy with it.
"It's been a while since I purchased this purse, but use it almost every day and love it.  Need to get another color asap.  The color on my tan is fading ever so slightly after a year, but it's not enough to stop me from using it.  Quality, soft leather, would highly recommend."
"Nice sandals, just too big so I returned them.  Good service."
"These shoes fit great and look great with some nice blue jeans, really can't go wrong with them. I personally love them."
Much lovelier in person and so unique!
Perfect! I love them!
"Love my robe. I only had issues with the tag behind my neck. I had to cut it out because it scratches but other than that, love the robe"
I really needed this larger size dome but wanted something small enough to fit in my briefcase.  This meets all that with auto open and close.  Couldn't be happier
I'm using it now really like it alot.
"The first pair of earrings I was not happy with, and I returned them for another pair.  The second pair is perfect; the earrings sparkle, the cuts are clean, and they are matched in size and color.  I could not be more pleased.  In the process, I also found out that this company has excellent customer service."
Really warm and not too heavy. Perfect for my daughter to use for school and not feel bulky.
"My daughter has been wanting a pair of high top sneakers for school this year and these Skechers are the 3rd pair we have tried.  I have ordered and returned 2 other brands the same price as these because they were uncomfortable and cheaply made.  I'm so glad we decided to try the Skechers Zipsters, my daughter and I are both very happy with them.  She has 2 other pairs of Skechers, Go Walks, which she loves, and I think that Skechers run a bit big so I ordered about a half size smaller than her normal size in other shoes and they fit perfectly.  That is why I put that they fit as expected.  They are well made, soft and comfortable inside, and have a lot of really cute little details.  They are very on trend, will go with so many of her outfits, exactly what we were looking for.  We have always had such good results with Skechers in the past, everyone in our family has at least one pair, I wish we would have just avoided those other brands and went straight to the Skechers, would have saved me a ton of time, next time we will.  In fact I'm thinking of getting her the navy pair of Zipsters for Christmas."
"Good price for four lovely clips. Still have held up, easy to clean, really makes your formal wear stand out a bit."
package arrive fast and wife love it because she can put her things and the baby items and she doesnt have a problems with the strap
"I love this ring, its really pretty and looks not cheap..BUT. My original rinf size 7.5 so I order size 8, but when its came it was actually smaller than 7. so order for a few sizes bigger."
I have found this product to be very useful in securing my ankle bracelet. I use the extender as a backup to the magnetic clasp which has a tendency to open. The extender helped to keep the ankle bracelet on my ankle. Wish the extenders were silver or non-tarnish.
Product exceeded expectations.
LOVE SO COMFY
Sizes run small. The 12 month shirt fit like a 9 month shirt.
"This is a very cute sweater.  I really like the design and it is made very well.  Unfortunately for me, I live in California and it is so heavy I hardly get to wear it.  I think it would be great for colder climates."
Very nice product.  It's exactly what I wanted
The waist fits perfectly.  The legs are wider/baggier than the picture shows.  Wrinkle-free.  easy care.
"This is an amazing purchase and my husband and I could not be happier!

We just got married November 2015 and spent our honeymoon in HI. While visiting Kona, we came across a local jewelry store that sold koa wood rings. We both agreed to wait until our one year anniversary and get each other a koa wood ring since they were so pricey ($200-$1000). So when I had the opportunity to purchase this koa wood ring at a discount for my honest and unbiased review, I jumped on it!

It arrived quickly and was well packaged. The ring came in a nice, masculine ring box. I took a look at it and thought it looked just as nice as the more expensive versions in Hawaii. I could not wait to give it to my husband yesterday! He was excited, then concerned that I just spent hundreds of dollars! I laughed and explained to him that I almost felt ""cheap"" by spending so little!

He loves it and said to give it 5 stars. I ordered an 8.5 (his 8.75 wedding band is slightly large) and it fit perfectly! In fact, he said he most likely will wear this ring on a daily basis in place of his wedding band, saving that for more special occasions.

The koa wood has a beautiful rich color and grain. The bevelled edge is a nice touch. The 8mm width does not feel bulky to him (his wedding band is 7mm and loathed 8mm when we searched for his wedding band). Surprisingly, it does have the comfort fit design, which was unexpected.

Since it is tungsten, I expect the ring to last a long time. We are thoroughly satisfied with this ring and is a steal at any price they have listed. I would highly recommend this, especially if you long for the Hawaiian islands like we do.

Now, let's see what he gets me! ;)"
Love me some Barepaw sandles 5 pair
Perfect for a bachelorette party. Looked very nice and held up toa night of partying
"This was s gift for my ""Percy Jackson"" crazed 13 year old, she loves it and wears it often. It has held up very well to numerous washing machine visits"
Love this skirt! It is full and poofy as I hoped it would be. Much fuller than the ones in the stores..
".  Beautiful bag, it is classy and well made. It is a bit smaller than i thought and the yellow is not as bright, more mustard. But all in all it is really a nice configured bag, big enough to hold a lot, just though it look bigger. Good buy anyway"
I love all the colors of these shoes. They're fairly comfy for a wedge. I usually put in an insole. I wear an 8.5 and this is pretty snug. Next time I'll order another 9 and an the insole.
My son just got to wear his snow bib and it is very warm and fits as I would have expected it to.
The shoe is okay
"I had been looking for a chain that was right for awhile length color and value.  I four it with this purchase this was a good deal,"
love it just what  I wanted
"They fit a bit narrow - I had to return my usual size, but going up 1/2 a size larger did the trick.  These boots are so comfortable!  The sole provides good support without being too bulky.  They are casual, definitely good with jeans.  I have worn them in rain and snow, and my feet have stayed dry and toasty."
"Not as warm as it looks, so buy it large enough to wear a sweater under for weather below 30 degrees."
"I like it a lot. I've had it for over a month and worn it a couple of times and the gold plated areas are changing colors, more brass looking now. I still rock it and like it."
"I ordered these about 2 or 3 days before Thanksgiving 2012 and they arrived 12/6/12! That said - they are really, really, really beautiful gloves. The lining is warm enough to stave off the cold New England weather and they look really good. My ring finger is size 9 so I ordered the large gloves. The coloring is more of a creamy beige in color than the white look on the picture. Also - they were very snug and I didn't think they would fit by looking at them. However, I stretched them out first and they went on easily,  plus I have extra room to wear my wedding ring set, withou it puncturing the leather."
"Ordered this for my bf. Ordered a large, tag does say 2XL but fits like large. Looks like the picture."
"I gave only 4 stars coz the packaging was not good at all. I bought the truffle and flint colored shirts. I am impressed how soft and light the shirts were. It was made of 100% polyester, so there is no  chance to shrink after washing and drying. THESE SHIRTS RUN LARGE. GET ONE SIZE DOWN OF YOUR USUAL SIZE. I usually wear medium size shirts but this HAGGAR brand shirt was way too big. WHAT I OBSERVED OF THIS BRAND IS THEIR SIZING IS OFF. I bought few HAGGARS SWEATERS and I always buy one size down, but this shirts I thought it would be different. I like the shirts so I am keeping them for gifts. I JUST ORDERED 2 SHIRTS OF SAME COLORS THAT I ORDERED PRVIOUSLY, but in SMALL SIZE for myself. The shirts are not bad at all. Quality is great,  the design of the fabric is modern and the cut is stylish. Very, very affordable. I am very satisfied with my purchase.  NOTE: 10/10/15 The small size I ordered was perfect. I reorderd 7 of different colors in small size for gifts FOR MY STAFF. MY BIRTHDAY is just few weeks from now and I am almost complete with my shopping. I purchased a lot of items today. IT IS MY TRADITION EVERY YEAR ON MY BIRTHDAY I USUALLY GIVE GIFT FOR MY STAFF. SHARE THE BLESSINGS. Thank you to AMAZON for saving my time shopping at rhe mall. I REALLY ENJOYED SHOPPING ONLINE BECAUSE AMAZON MADE ALL THE ITEMS I PURCHASED WERE DISCOUNTED. Thank you so much. I am still thinking what to buy next!!!!!!!!!."
"Very glad I read the reviews before buying. These run large so go for a size smaller. The panty that comes with it is crap and actually showed up torn (not to mention huge) but I didn't buy it for that.
I bought the 4xl mainly to fit my chest. I'm a F cup with a size 14 waist so buying clothes or even corsets that look right for me is a pain. Not disappointed in this product. The material is comfortable but you might want to replace the ribbon. I wouldn't wear this every day either but it's well enough made that you could wear it pretty often."
Third pair. Only thing I like to wear
"I love my Reeboks... have been wearing them for the past several years, specifically for running. I would recommend Reebok Zigtech for any runner. Great shoes!"
Nice outfit - the only part I don't like was that the body piece was a little big and the mask was a little small for my son. I wish the mask could be bigger. My son is only 4 so I ordered the size above his age since I have had experiences before with costumes running small. Glad I didn't order his age or the mask probably would not fit him at all.
lots of compliments for these
"This is the third one I bought, worked very well in very windy conditions.  Did flip up when opened once due to high winds, but didn't break.  Very well made and extremely durable.  A tremendous value for the price, can;t go wrong purchasing this item.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Benkii-60-Mph-Windproof-10-Rib-Travel-Umbrella-Purple/dp/B01N2GNCE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Benkii 60 Mph Windproof 10 Rib Travel Umbrella, Purple</a>"
Seem well made and fit perfectly
Very pretty scarf. Looks the same online in person. Bought this as a gift for a friend and I will now be getting some for myself.
"This bra fits well. The coloring is nice and will be invisible under most clothes. It shapes the bustline nicely as compared to many wire-free bras. Deducted a star because it creates little triangles of fat at the armpit, which are annoying. Otherwise, a comfortable, well made, supportive choice for women who hate wires."
"These are very attractive socks. When I washed them I was a little surprised that they did shrink. However, I put them on and - voila! - they accommodated my feet. I love that they're organic and have a feminine pattern. I live in Hawaii, so I also really appreciate their light weight (I really don't need heavy-duty socks!)."
I love this shoe.  Nice and lightweight so my son doesn't get tripped up.  Great look and would buy again and again.
My little princess wanted to wear it to school.  She loves it.
"My son is tall and skinny.  These worked out great!  They are well made, good quality and should last.  We will buy more when needed."
"I normally wear a size 9.5. I've had a size 9.5 W Ryka shoe before and it was slightly too narrow and too small.  I thought a half size larger would be perfect.  This shoe is an improvement, but still slightly too narrow. Hopefully will stretch out a bit with wear.  It still is a keeper!  Still very comfortable. Nice look."
"My boyfriend wears normal cloth Tabi's all the time. He ninja trains with his class and brothers every week. I thought this would make a perfect gift, since these are a little more heavy duty, and he is absolutely in love with them and wears nothing but these wherever he goes. He thinks they are great."
Great Volcom design
These are fantastic!!  My husband is tall and they look like a shirt he could actually wear out in public in!!
"Bought for my 14 year old son for trip to snowy area. Love how it looks and fits! He loves it, too! Not overly heavy, but very warm. Great!"
"In love with it !!!!! Perfect Choice !
High quality product"
looks just right!
I have no problems with the heel of the slipper as did some others because I don't wear them with the back up. I push it down and wear them like big cozy clog.
Soooo comfortable to wear on hot summer days. Amazing support and no shoulder digs.
Hard to find size 14s.  But these fit great and hopefully will work just as well.
Very cute and stylish! I love a little heel and these shoes are perfect and make my feet feel secure and stable when walking.
"After reading reviews Im glad I ordered the lgs. Im 53, 126lbs, 36C or B depending and normally I wear a medium or even a small depending on the style and fit. Im glad I got the lg because these fit very comfortably. I don't like really tight shirts in hot, humid summer days and these are 100% cotton and could shrink. They are very soft and so far so good. Could even dress up a bit."
"Love these! They are very light and the coloring is great. Great price. I have several pair of Michael Kors sunglasses that I have paid a great deal more for and the qualtiy of these is the same.
 I would highly recommend these to anyone."
My daughter really likes them. Comfortable and not itchy.
I'm glad I got the small/med. It Is a little big but perfect for a tall women if you are under 6ft.
"These socks were as described and fit well. They stay up and don't sag, which is important. They arrived promptly."
"Muy buenas y bonitas, son muy cmodas!, hay que comprar una talla mas, porque son de horma pequea.  Excelente. las recomiendo!"
"Very very comfortable,Can wear all day!"
"Nice bright color, fits well, son loves it."
"Working security in the Pacific North Wet(intentional)having some  level of waterproof is necessary, especially because a lot of the time I do security for a port. These fit the bill, they don't absorb water and it can be shaken off easily. They have many awesome pocket options. That is great if you need to store many different items. They are a good pant for security work. I am going to be buying another pair. They are comfortable.

I noticed that they are a little short however so I would order a size longer and larger than you normally would. And like I said, LINT ROLLER. They collect everything. Even given that I love these pants."
Would prefer flap snaps that snap and are not magnetic.  I do appreciate the fact that the vendor contacted me for details of my recommendation.  Plus one for customer service and listening to the consumer! So 4 stars despite I would rather have some snaps.
It was the perfect size for my former boss' desk.  She loves shoes.  Prettier than the picture as was sparkly  and could be used as a paperweight or put M&Ms in  it for her desk.  She was delighted.
This necklace is beautiful and at a great price!
"These appear to fit my grandson, but he says they're too tight, and he doesn't like to wear them."
"Elegant shirt, good quality item."
Love this shirt. Nice soft material.
"Extremely adorable shoes!! My toddler loves them, and insists on wearing them even though it's sweltering outisde. She says they're cuter and more comfortable than her sandals. We've had it for a month so far, and the glitter hasn't shed, which is a MASSIVE plus from a mama's point of view. That's what worried me the most but these sneakers were just too cute to pass up. They fit very well, and are true to size."
Cool golf shoes
Love it. Very roomy for all my jewelry
"Love these shoes! So cute and pretty comfortable. I have very narrow feet and the strap across the toes was a little snug when I first started wearing them, but has stretched a little. Someone with a less narrow foot would probably not be able to wear these."
"I am used to the old fashioned kind of leather key holder that zips as this one does, but the keys had to be slipped under and through little key chain holders. It was very difficult to do, and one could lose some finger skin in the process. This Genuine Leather Key Chain Holder Coin Pocket #412CF is a bit larger than what I'm used to, and instead of getting right to work inserting the keys (as I am used to) I am sitting here trying to figure out how to open these larger key chains without breaking them off of the holders. Okay done. Do not order this key chain holder unless you first have a pair of needle nose pliers, a regular medium sized screw driver and some very strong fingers. I was able to open a few of the key chain holders with my fingers, but with some I absolutely needed pliers. If you should open the individual key holder too wide to close it, gently close the holder with the pliers until you have a snug fit. All this is actually as easy as I hoped it would be.  The Leather Key Chain Holder has been my preferred style for the last twenty years. The main problem is eventually the the small circular holders for the key chains will break out of the holding bar (that is attached to the leather across the top) These key chain holders would last a lot longer if one remembered to be gentle, every time you unzip the key chain holder to grasp an individual key and slowly insert your keys into your doors and other types of locks. This can be a hard thing to remember depending on what kind of day you are having! From experience I have learned to carry an extra set of keys on a small round key chain, just in case one of the keys happens to come lose without me realizing this. These appear to be solidly made so I would not expect any problems for at least a year or so. I am giving this the highest rating because, this is my type of key holder in style, plus I like the new wide key chain holders, that are easier to manipulate than they look, and you simply cannot beat the price!"
feet nicely on the body
"The guys love them,they say they are comfy"
"Love this brand.  The Arch Support is super.  This is the third pair I have purchased (one for me, one my husband and one daughter)"
"Brought as a gift for Mom, she loves that she can wear them in the yard, or when mopping etc., because of the rubber (or plastic) sole. Plus, the price is right. Went back and brought other pairs for gifts."
"I'm not an experienced basketball player by any means, but as I was just getting started to play in my older age, I realized that running shoes and sneakers weren't cutting it. I just wanted something affordable to get me into the game! And I was pleasantly surprised by how much more fun it was to play once I put on this pair of shoes. There's plenty of cushion and fit was snug. Don't know if there is any better options, but will come back and modify if I find a better option."
"Bought these as a gift for my boyfriend, and he loves them.  We can both recommend these shirts.  They're great!"
"Bought these boots because we needed something to wear when it rains and for my 5yr old son to stomp around in the mud. These fit the bill nicley. Seem to fit great and are well built, Should last a few years. Recently wore them up in the snow and they were great!!"
Excellent buy I love the color
If you wear a size 8. You will need a Medium size and not a small. Product is very nice and the adjustable straps are nice.
"I am very happy with this bag.  It has many nice features such as a window for my driver's license, slots for credit cards.  Very good value for the money!"
"This suit is SUPER cute and way better quality than I expected, considering how inexpensive it was. It fits well, and the top is snug enough that you could wear it as a bandeau (the straps are removable) without it failing on you. The bottoms are rouched on the sides, which gives it a bit of flair & forgiveness. While the bottoms come up as high as in the picture, I was *slighty* disappointed that the top is not as long as it appears in the picture. That being said, it's still a great top & one that I can easily mix & match with other bottoms. Again, for the price, totally exceeded expectations (which is even higher praise since no one likes bathing suit shopping)!

Note: I also originally posted a picture of the bathing suit - similar to all the others on here - with my review, but Amazon deemed it somehow, outside of their review guidelines."
"Nice fit and quality for price , fits son well, fast shippinfg"
I was unable to find fit flops in the style / size/ and color I wanted so I opted for this style.  I am so happy I did as I find this has the ultimate comfort in the footbed for me who has plantar fasciitis which is extremely painful in the heel area.  This fit flop is amazing and I'll order more in this style and hope it continues with no changes.
Great quality!!!  I liked the fact they were all plastic wrapped to keep them nice.
Soooo cute on my grandbaby and well made...loved it...
Cute shirt and worked for my purpose. I thought it was a bit expensive.
This is my second pair which lasted two years of more or less all day and half the night usage and yes I went outside in them.  The sole was still sound but the fleece material had pulled away from the sole in a few places and finally the entire right front section was loose from the sole.
Great fit my son love them
LOVE  EASY SPIRIT ALL I WEAR. I  ONLY WEAR PLAIN DESIGNS AND THOUGHT I WOULD TRY SOMETHING AND THE PRICE WAS JUST RIGHT.  I ORDER SEVERAL TIMES A YEAR  WHEN I FIND A GREAT SALE.  SO THANK YOU FOR THE QUALITY MAYBE THICKEN THE INNERSOLES..  GREAT DESIGN WITH BLACK LEATHER.
"I am 5' 7"" and close to 200lbs, mainly have weight through my midsection. I really want to love this suite but I am not yet sure. I ordered a xxl based on a couple reviews and as others said the top fits larger than the bottoms. The bottoms fit me pretty well but both the tops were too bit and made it look sloppy. I am going to exchange for the xl in hopes of a better fit. The suite itself feels well made, just not sure about the cut. The search for the perfect suite is on!"
"I love it.  Since I wear it virtually every day, I'm sure it will hold up.  It's sturdy and well made.  The closing ratchet is fantastic."
Expensive but works as advertised
The bracelet is nice and will jazz up any outfit. I received the bracelet in good condition with no stones missing or discoloration. I paid $3.19 for it and was very satisfied. The bracelet isn't heavy or cheap looking either. The bracelet is a stretched bracelet and all the squares line up nicely. The bracelet I received was red and came in a plastic bag inside of black gift box. For $3.19 I highly recommend this bracelet.
"Great shoes, and my husband loves them. Would buy again any day!"
Exceeded my expectations. Adorable and very nicely done.
"Perfect, and they do not decolorate with laundry... good material and fit."
"Although the sweater took a long time to get here it was worth the wait. I'm a perfect Asian size medium and this fits great! Love the pattern, one of my favorite cardigans. It even came with two small pockets on the side which was an unexpected surprise."
This is fantastic as a potty watch for my daughter.  The only downside is that it scratches easily.
Nice top for your money.
"It arrived on time and the shoes is made with good quality. I will probably buy one more for my mum. In addition, it is cheap~"
they fit true to size & they came in a week
Fits my son perfect!
"Best fitting boots, fit exactly like the shoes. Will definitely purchase again."
"All is good, great price."
Cute shoes. Not real leather but hold up well
Soft shoes. But the upper is a little bit low
Cute and classy.  These sandals fit well and look good.
"Form Fitting
These shirts show off your body, if you are buff that's great, but you might not like it to accentuate your love handles."
These hats are of excellent quality! Will be getting more for Christmas!
Very comfortable soles.
got the wrong size so I gave it to my daughter
Met my expectations size wise and comfort. Was a little concerned about size from reading other reviews but fit was good.  They were also more comfortable than expected.
"Exactly what I was looking for, I like the extra length so you don't constantly have to pull it down"
Like the style. Works well for me who has flat feet.
"Great for the money definitely required upgrades! Long nice gloves, for those short sleeves, a better belt. I found the best boots ever from Kohls. This fabric is cheap too, but it does look good especially from a distance. For photo reference I am 55 tall and petite!"
"This robe is fine for the price.  It is soft enough and not too warm, which is what I wanted as I am always on the warm side.  I ordered the XL/XXL, and is comfortably roomy (I'm 6'0"", 230 lbs), so if you're kind of on the fat side like me, you should be good to point, but I'm not sure where that point is.  The sleeves are short, but I thought that was how this style of robe was supposed to be, so it doesn't bother me."
"A little bigger than I expected but it still looks good. I would make some changes if the hemlines weren't so obvious, but it'll have to stay as it is. Obviously not real leather but it's still sexy and I actually like the fact that it's not skin tight. Less tramp and more fashion that way."
Fits large but you can adjust the back strap to push your foot to the center.
"Love this! I'm 5'9"" DD bra 155lbs and I wear a medium. The fabric is so soft it's my favorite thing to wear to bed! So easy to nurse in, I want one in every color so I can wear it every night of the week! Great baby shower gift, it would be perfect for that first night in the hospital after you have the baby!"
"I was looking for a bag that wasn't too heavy and this is perfect.  Roomy, lined and with a cute print"
"These weren't quite as thick as I expected/hoped they would be but have worked out well.  I wear them in cowboy boots which are just a tad too big and hoped they would take up some of the slop but they aren't much thicker than dress socks.  However, after getting some gel inserts for the boots, they are working out okay.  I get irritated when boots rub my bare calf (like with crew cut socks) and these stay up over the calf, as they should, so I find the boots more comfortable to wear now.  We'll see how they hold up after a few washings."
I took it with me to Italy and france . Everybody there was wearing these glasses with blue color lenses . I like it very much and the price is awesome
I bought this for my husband and he loved it! It fit just right and stayed in place after getting wet. Would highly recommend!
My grand daughter loves this suit. It fits very well.
LOVE THEM. I have the long ones and needed summer time socks. I will never go back to Cheap socks again
Well made fits perfect love it
"These glasses really do help find golf balls.  When wearing them, the grass looks dull and everything white looks brighter and stands out more!  Colored balls do not work as well.  The glasses don't fit me (a petite woman) very good because they are made to fit an average man (they fit my husband very nicely and he said they are very comfortable to wear). These are not good for wearing throughout the golf round because the brightness they create bothered my husband's eyes.  However, using them in the cart while searching for the golf balls works great! I found them helpful and will continue to use them."
Found what I've Been looking for
Love the socks however they are a tad smaller than what I thought I ordered but fit very snug. Nice lace trim. Next order will go one size larger if available.
My 9 yo son loves this hat. Great fit and excellent sun coverage. He looks like he's going on a safari.
"Love them! Took them on vacation and I received many compliments. Great quality, many extras included. Hard case, silky bag, cleaning cloth and screwdriver. Ordered another pair in the same brand."
"The material is breathable, the bra seems like it is good quality. I don't think the plastic clips will break or be a problem in the future. It is very comfortable as well. My only complaint would be that the back section where the clasps are is a little bit hard and itchy if you use the last notch, it can be irritating but I've gotten use to it."
"This is truly a beautiful necklace.  Very Downton Abbey, reminiscent of the necklace Lady Mary wore in the first series. Well made, fits beautifully,and is lovely if you enjoy period dressing, as I do. The company, based in the U.K., provided excellent service; my order arrived within two weeks of ordering."
"This arrived the other day and I have to say I was really impressed with the high quality.  Even the packaging was something that screamed luxury and high class.

My husband is wearing it today for the first time.  Even though it comes with a kit to make adjustments, it fit him perfectly so we didn't need to use the kit.
He's worn magnetic bracelets in the past and it's really helped him with some health issues including back pain, so we're hoping this one will be the same.
I received this bracelet at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion."
"I love this pant because it fits perfect. I need them for work so it is easy for me to order on line and get in a few days.
I now have 4 pairs in Khaki and 3 pairs in black. They also have held up really well from many washes."
A bit too large to call this a Newborn size hat.
Exactly as pictured. Very fast shipping. It's perfect!
"More comfortable than expected ! Super light, yet durable."
The boob coverage isn't that great on the sides.
"My husband did have to re-attach some of the hardware, but that was no biggie.  I lovely piece of furniture. Amazon is my go to place!  I don't have to fight the crowds and I just let my fingers do the walking."
I love it the strap is comfortable and long just how I like it it has a lot of space which is good I tend to carry many items and the inner pocket is bid enough to keep all my make up in also very stylish and cheap I really do like it.
I bought this for my husband and he loved it. Said it fit well and he wears it around the house a lot.
"I love it, but be careful not to overstuff it with cards or it will stretch. However, it definitely beats my old wallet. If I need to replace this one, I'll definitely consider another just like it."
"I bought this for my almost 5 year old daughter for Christmas. She adores it and shows it to any visitors to our home. It doesn't seems like amazingly high quality, but she's not really rough with her toys and she keeps this on a shelf in her room and I think it will hold up for years."
"I purchase this shoes to replace a 30 Years old pair jut like them,the only differences was that the laces on the original pair are white not a problem
I replace the laces with white leather laces. The new top siders are extremely comfortable .
Carlos j. Dominguez"
"Love, love, love these boots.  They are so comfy and keep my feet toasty warm.  Look so cute with my skinny jeans.  Would definitely buy again!"
"Very soft fabric, fit is good and comfy- I ordered large & im 145 pounds 5'2. This is my 3rd attempt to review, first two were rejected not sure why"
My daughter was thrilled to receive them. They got her perfectly.
good fit... thanks!!!
"Since this listing combines several colors, I'll mention we got the blue nylon band with the white face, black #s, and shiny silver metal.

My husband and I are both watch enthusiasts.  From simple to dressy, but thankfully not necessarily expensive.  In this case, there are certain things we liked and a couple of things we didn't, but it's still a decent timepiece.

It's fairly weighty - the band is light but the case is what I'd call quite large and heavy.  Very thick and wide.

The band is dark blue nylon but it's relatively thin, not thick and clunky.  We had tried another watch with a nylon band and my husband didn't like it because it made his arm sweat, but this one didn't, I guess because it's thinner and not so heavy.  It doesn't feel flimsy, though.

The stem does have 2 positions, but the half-out position does not change the date, it moves the hour hand.  The full-out position will move both minute and hour hands like usual.  We don't care for that.  The date will need changing almost every other month, whereas I don't find the need to change just the hour hand, so I think it was a poor design decision.  It's big and easy to get ahold of, though, so you might not mind it.  We do, so I took -1 for it.

The extra buttons seem to be metal, which is nice - in another style with chrono the buttons are gray plastic.  I like the ones on this better.

This one ticks softer than most, and can barely be heard if you put it up to your ear.  All in all it's still a decent, good looking watch, I guess it's just not our taste is all.

[...]"
grand girls birthday gift  ( twins ) look great loved them
"They are very nice pants. I measured my inseam and decided to go with the smallest, I don't know how to say that correctly, but they ride up on me while the pant legs are too long and drag on the floor. I'm no seamstress so I'm in a quandary as to what to do.

Again, I really like the pants. They could be worn to a nice event, if you were comfortable doing that. Mine just don't fit right."
"It was slightly large but after I washed and dried it, it fits perfectly now.  Love it !"
My 14-year-old son loves them!
"My 13 year old daughter is a child size large, so I ordered the smallest size available.  It is still a bit big, but she loves the lab coat.  Great quality and style."
It's better then expected. Great Value!
"I ordered two sets. Two ran right out the gate the other 4 held up and are back in my drawer waiting for there next debut.  I was going on vacation and knew I would be wearing a lot of nice dresses in a cold climate, I am glad I find these easily on amazon and that I ordered two."
"Luv the fit, the comfort and style!"
"Got this for grand-daughter age 3. Wears it on the beach after swimming is done. It is light, and airy and so cute she loves to wear this. It needs to be washed in gentle cycle or by hand, material is pretty delicate but decently made."
I ordered a size larger and it fit perfectly. If your larger than 44dd you may have issues during into the cups of the bra. I thought the panties and fader would be seperate pieces but it's all in one. Overall nice quality and looked great on me
Good quality jeans but i can buy them for about two dollars less at my local Walmart.
"My husband got his hat today and he loves it,and that's saying a lot because he is very picky :-)"
Heart in heart.  My family loves it.
"Everything was as good as expected except, the belt loop will not hold its position. Keeps loosening. Haven't been able to figure it out so it won't keep moving."
"Nice, fine, great value."
My husband says nothing feels better than new underwear & socks!  These are his new favorites too.
"I look great in these glasses and they are really comfii on my nose.  They may look heavy, but really they are not.  Looks great with any type of clothing you want to wear."
The quality of this necklace is amazing. I honestly love it...
These are good warms gloves. What else can I say
Great wear for chemistry class!
great fit nice style
"I was happy with the style, but unfortunately, they were somewhat large.  Its like they were extra wide and not the B medium width that I ordered.  If I wear them with thick socks, they work okay, but I wanted these for use in warm weather, so they didn't turn out to be the shoe of my dreams.  I did love the color and the suede feel though."
Very soft. Nice quality.
I read the reviews that said this bra runs small so I bought one cup.size.larger than I normally would and it fit me beautifully.
Nice style for both casual dress and casual business.
Love them just a bit too small but still comfortable
nice shirt and arrived before expected
These are soft slippers with a slightly fleecy interior. Nice for warmer days when you need just a bit of warmth but nothing too heavy. They have tiny nubs on the bottom to keep from slipping. Work well on my hard wood floors.
"Solid, good finish and no obvious flaws. The bracelet is better quality than I had expected. Not sure this is beatable for the money if its the size you want."
"I love these ankle boots. So comfy&easy to wear. They are so cute
I will order another pair."
Foot heaven...that is all
"These boots are excellent!  Soooo comfortable and durable.  I've had many pair in the past, and wear them 'til they finally die.  However, I have always bought the ones with a zipper.  I found this particular style difficult to put on and take off because I have a high instep. This is a common problem for me in many types of shoes and boots, too.  I just didn't think before I bought them.  I'm hoping Ariat will take pity on me by letting me exchange them for the ones with a zipper.  I wore them twice to the barn so they are now used.  :("
"Good quality and very versatile. So many times the inner jacket doesn't look very good without the outer jacket, but no matter how you wear this jacket it looks great.  It goes together easily with a snap connector at the neck and wrists.  My son didn't like his last jacket because it was too difficult to change, but he has no problems with this one."
"I simply love these slippers.  So much so I want to get another pair.  Our old house is cold, and  the kitchen floor being over an uninsulated crawl space can feel as cold as an outside pavement.  These slippers have a thick padding that keeps my feet toasty warm.  And with the hard sole they can be used for running to the mailbox or garage or even to the grocery story. These slippers are so warm that my feet actually can get sweaty in them."
Great well balanced purse for an adult
This dress is so darling. I am 5'3.5 and I weigh 185 it fit my curves perfect. I am very small in the middle and large on the bottom I hope that helps. I wear a 34DD bra size so that might help for people to know what the top was perfect for. I think it is absolutely great. I wore it on a cruise and got tons of compliments I bought it in blue. I would buy this again and other items from this retailer.
This thong sandal has a unique design across the top. The sole is cushioned and very comfortable with a perfect fit. The Transaction went smoothly with quick shipping.
"Love these rings. Stones are not big, and they look great together. Pleased with my purchase."
"The idea of an elastic, adjustable belt that has a magnetic belt buckle is the perfect fix for a thin 4 year old!

  Thanks for the find Amazon!"
"Super I got a pair couple years ago locally , love this shoe so much I was willing to get any color when I found out they were discontinued . Orthotics fit in just great. Love the speed lacing . I have weak ankles from surgeries this is one of the trail running shoe or running shoe with a wide heel base that prevents ankle from rolling.  Really stable for pronaters or supernators ."
Thought these were good socks until I bought some from Carhartt.
"These boots are not only super cute, but super comfortable for my son. He is 2.5 and he wears the size 8 and he loves these boots! Soft and flexible!"
"this is my second pair of Chip boots.  These are the same size as the first, but fit a small bit loose on my 10.5W foot.  Not enough to size down however.  On the plus side, the break-in period was not long at all."
It's very nice ... maybe just a little too long. Think it would look best on taller women.
My dad loved it. It was so easy for him to adjust when he went from standing up to sitting down. He absolutely loves it. He's a hard to buy for picky person too
"Absolutely as advertised - very pretty, fit perfectly."
"Not sure how I found anything in my bags before this, oh wait, I didn't. I just carried less because I knew this would get lost in there but not anymore!"
Very good quality. Good embossed designed adds style.
I was surprised with the overall quality of this! The construction and material are better than the $8 price tag. It was shipped and delivered much sooner than the estimated time! It looks great on! I ordered an xl which it is a little big all over but not a big deal- 5'4 180.
"I really like this sports bra.  I love the front open/close zipper.  The zipper makes putting this bra on and taking it off quick and easy.  I do with there was an actual zipper locking mechanism but for the most part the zipper stays where it is supposed to.  The bra is comfortable to wear for several hours at a time.

Overall, it's really nice sports bra and I recommend it wholeheartedly!"
"These flip flops are great. I ordered two pair I full size up as I was told they run small, I could have just gone up 1/2 size but they still fit wonderfully"
Son loves. Wore every day for a year. Still going strong . Nice quality
Excellent sneakers... Pura vida 
"These boots are great.  Very comfortable, waterproof, made in USA, resoleable. I was tired of disposable shoes/boots and wanted something that was made in America and could be repaired.  The leather is extremely soft."
"Main issue I have with this is the inner pockets next to the pocket where you would put your cash in, it's not sewn on inside the pocket.  This creates a problem if you have a card in those pockets and try to take it out, it will get caught on the fabric as you try to take a card out of those two pockets.  I had 6 cards, one in every pocket and some cash in the main pocket and it was difficult to get a card out of those inner ones.  If you don't use those inner pockets the wallet is good for a minimalist wallet.

I have changed my rating to 4 stars because the customer service was excellent.  I received an email from the company stating that if the wallet was too small they would ship me a different wallet free of charge.

I did not ask for the replacement wallet since I am using a ridgewallet at the moment.  Great customer service!  If my ridgewallet fails me I will definitely purchase from this company again."
its my something blue.
I cant say enough good things about these earrings! They are the perfect size and weight to be beautiful and dainty. They are not too small though. Very shiny silver and the design is beautiful! They can be worn with jeans or dressing up.
"Just walked all over Peru in these shoes and wore them at work where I am running around and on my feet all day! The memory foam is incredible and the comfort of the woven breathable fabric and ultra lightweight sole make these shoes perfect for work and travel. I bought them in the grey/black speckled woven fabric with the grey sole as well. Note: I normally wear a 7.5 but have a very narrow foot and heel so I got a size 7 and they fit perfectly. No complaints whatsoever on this shoe! Plus, everyone asks me what brand they are and where I got them all the time."
"Looks great, won an ugly sweater contest at work with it. The colors really clash. The hat is pink, not red so it looks pretty awesome.

6'5'' 230, XL was too big in the stomach, too short in the arms but that can be expected with my size.

Only issue was the bottom of the sweater was tighter than the stomach area, so the fabric billowed quite a bit. But awesome quality for a $25 sweater."
Just a little narrow but very cute.
Absolutely LOVE this tote! So cute and the perfect size!
"I have a small mesh evening bag in black that is about 2/3 the size of this one. I love it for when I am dressing more formally, and I wanted something similar in red.  This bag is perfect.  It's not intended as an everyday purse, so I don't expect it to hold everythign I normally carry.  Never-the-less, it holds way more than I expected or thought it would judging by the size and picture.  This is larger than the average ""clutch"" evening bag. I managed to get two change purses, tic tacs, my phone, chapstick and my sunglasses into the bag with no issue (and all my cards/cash inside the zip pocket).

In addition, the bag has a long chain that goes over the shoulder, or you can tuck inside and carry this like a true clutch.  The color is a bold, fire engine/apple red, and the bag is very well made.  It has one zip-close pocket inside.  It was $24 (as of this writing), and worth the price.  Overall, I love this bag and highly recommend it. Please see my pictures of the actual bag I received."
This is great! The fit is a bit big on the bottom but I love it! It's great on its own or with leggings!!
"I ordered a large and it fits fine. A little snug for my preference but that's a personal preference. Most would find
The fit is as it should be. If I lose 3-5 more lbs will fit to my liking. Order according to your true size. I wear 12. Usually order 12-14"
great top just ordered wrong size
Ran a little small but these have held up amazingly well!
If u buy grey and sweat a lot maybe this isn't for you. I change my tshirt from heather grey to sweat grey in about 15 minutes of exercise good thing it breathes easy and looks good.
Good old-fashioned sweat pants. Just what I was looking for.
Love this sandal.  It is just as pictured.  Very comfortable to walk and stand in.  I really like this style of sandals.  I think it is very becoming on the foot.
Soft. Good product
Love the socks. Fit my 2 year old who has large wide feet.
Love it!! Is beautiful
"T-shirt fits well, is soft, and appears decently made.  The emblem is just a pictured and the color of the shirt is as well--no surprises (and that's a good thing in this case)!"
"I had been looking for a plain black dress with sleeves to wear to work.  This fit the bill perfectly.  It was very difficult finding a dress that is plain( i.e. no exposed zippers, patterned fabric, etc.) and work appropriate without looking like a trash bag.  This dress is perfect!  It isn't too tight or too loose and the fabric hangs very well.  It looks equally nice with and without a belt.  It is a fantastic addition to my wardrobe basics."
"Cute, only find at Amazon"
i am so happy i bought this.. several pairs of shoes now fit... my right foot is bigger than the left ... that had created problems.. but fixed today
"Very stylish, you can dress these chic sandals up or down...you won't be sorry with this purchase."
"Love these jeans. Fits perfectly, comfortable and the delivery from here has been speedy every time I have ordered. If I had a manufacturer problem, their customer service is phenomenal."
My son in law requested these for Christmas & he wears them all the time.
"I really like these shoes.  I have short, wide (4E) feet and these are just a bit bigger than New Balance.  The straps are too long and I don't know if I can make them shorter but the shoes are great and they are a little cheaper than New Balance."
My favorite fit for workout and looks good enough to wear to work on excercise days.
I continue to purchase these as they have good support and the cork inersole is great.
"These shoes are so good.  Really attractive, but especially well made!  The fit is perfect, the shoes are very comfortable.  I've never been happier with a walking shoe purchase ~ ever.  If I wear these out, I'll go straight back for more.  (I usually wear an 8 in walking shoes, but had a hunch because these were so good, that the fit would be perfect at 7.5. W. )  Perfect."
"Nice bag, very comfortable and the material is nice. Worth the price."
I FINALLY FOUND A PAIR OF GLOVES FOR THE COLD WEATHER!!!! Great price for a great pair of gloves!
"Lovely cardigan. Nicely constructed, soft fabric and a beautiful shade of teal blue."
"This bathing suit is really really pretty.  I am 5'8"", wear a 38D and I have full hips...this fit me great! I must say that the fabric is a bit thin and I haven't washed it yet...not sure how long it will last.  But it'll look pretty for at least a few wears I hope!"
"This shirt looks very nice on.  I wish it didn't wrinkle so easily, but otherwise great.  Fits as expected and nice an long.  Great with leggings."
"The striking watch is very cute, fashionable, but short automatic rope if I leave a day without using suddenly stops, if you use it every day enjoy an attractive watch for a ridiculous price"
found size 7 for my women's 8&1/2 foot and fit perfectly ( I have wide feet ).
"I like them, but ordered a shoe stretcher for a better fit rather than do a return."
Very comfortable and fashionable. I wear these with jeans and to work.
This is one of the best swim skirts I have bought and own. When I say that I must say I am a queen of swim skirts and that is the only swim bottoms I will wear. With that said I highly recommend thus suit. It fits amazing looks great. Washes up wash after wash nice. It keeps it color without fading.
nice wallet and lots of space
"I bought these along with a couple other pairs of Mary Janes, my 2yrs niece loves them."
"Love this charm!! I am new to the Pandora bracelets/charms and was disappointed to not see an Autism charm....until I found this one! It's very detailed & sturdy! I wear my bracelet daily, and get a great deal of compliments on this charm. I'm always asked where I found it, etc. It arrived really fast, and is superbly priced for the quality!

My son is a precious and unique gift and this charm is a lovely and daily reminder of what a wonderful blessing he is!"
"Very happy with the jeans, they fit perfectly and are holding up well through many washings.  I can highly recommend."
This is a very cute shirt for young boys. Can be worn dressed up or as a simple going out shirt. Looks great with the sleeves rolled as well.
"This is the BEST water shoe I have ever purchased and very cute.  I got a lot of compliments on them.  One thing if you have a high bridge on your foot the strap is going to be tight.  If you add Velcro to the strap to extend it, it makes all the difference! Used these this past weekend at a River Regatta, loved it!"
"Waited a few months to review, as this was my first thin/front pocket wallet.

Love it!  Absolutely love it.  Fits about 8-10 cards/IDs quite comfortably.  Love the pull out strap for the most used card(s).  And can even hold some bills as well, even though i don't often carry cash.  No regrets!"
My favorite cycling shoes! I wear a 43.5 and they were a tad bit tight the first wear. But now they're absolutely amazing!
My 6 year old Daughter really likes them!
I bought it for the public Sauna at my gym.  Others want one also
Work superbly especially with suitcases with relatively smaller zippers
Loves it!
I have plantar fasciitis which causes a lot of pain even in tennis shoes theses have been great I believe it because of the good arch ...love them!!
"Does exactly what it is supposed to do. Used it to keep my neck warm while riding a motorcycle in freezing weather. Wonderfully warm and soft. It will get a little too warm if you are active in moderately cold weather without wind. Riding on cool days the standard Buff will keep you warm, but when it is really cold the Polar Buff is really nice. Pulled up and worn to cover your noggin and neck all you need to do is add a cap to keep the snow off your glasses or from piling up on your nose :-) The Buff web site will teach you all the ways you can use Buff products. Check it out, then get one."
I bought these as a gift for my friend's 3 year old daughter. They are cute and seem to be good quality.
"luv em fit good , feel good what i expected"
love all vionice products
Love this umbrella because I can keep covered by it and see through it at the same time.
I t is a very nice piece of jewelry.  I wear it often.
Just in time for the holidays! A good way to dress up the layered outfit.
"Hi thanks, I got the product very happy for the purchase. Excellent all recommended i give top rating"
Gave as gift.  Saw recipient wearing it yesterday.  Good looking shirt.
"Perhaps it's just for me and my pronating feet, but I love this shoe - comfortable and fast.  Wish they still made them.  At least they're a even better deal now, as long as you can find them.  I bought a four pairs!"
"Quick shipping, shirt is very nice."
I like the look of garters without the clips and the hassle.  These were great!  All built in!  Might get some black next time.
"I'm very happy with this purchase. This is a heavy weight open front sweater. I live in the Midwest and this sweater is perfect for an extra layer. It's not cheap looking and the Owls aren't ""silly"" looking so I wore it to my office with a belted blouse and heels and received many compliments. It's a long sweater. Im 5'4 and it comes half way down my thigh. The sleeves are a bit long, had to cuff them.  I wasn't expecting much as the cost was so affordable, but am happily surprised. Also, the shipping was very fast. Received in about 2 weeks."
Great material and fits perfect!!! Love times love!
My husband loves these socks.  It is quite difficult to find socks other than your standard black dad socks with no personality.  These are fun and hold up well.
Worth the money they are so pretty comfy and durable. As a mail carrier i cannot wait to hop into these babies soon as i get home everyday.
Definitely a must have for the studio!
Very comfortable and the feel of the matetial is soft.
Daughter loves the look of them BUT they do run a bit narrow & a little more cushion. I'd opt for 1/2 size up & add inserts. Worth the price even with modifications.
Good fit and good feel
Love these boots and they look so cute and are so comfy! Immediately after taking them out of the box I sprayed them down with waterproof spray and that kept all the water from getting into them. They fit great on my muscular legging and keep my feet warm in the -20 degree winter weather. I can't ask for much more other then they do the job! I even shoveled my drive way in them and they still look good!
"Nice, sleek pumas. In red they look quite stylish. Very comfortable and light weight. At first, they seem narrow in the front but they still fit as expected with size 12 I usually get pumas.

The price kept falling until it reached $45; that's  when I decided to get them."
"i could tell from the picture that it was going to be a bit more form fitting so i ordered a large. its a bit tight especially for a large, but thats ok because i am losing weight. the material is thick cotton with a bit of a stretch to it. i really like this shirt i need to get one in blue."
"Very comfortable, cute and easy to wear"
My 7 year old loves them!
"I love this costume. It arrived on time and fits and looks great. I purchased M, which is my regular size. I am 5.5, 155 pounds. It says on the label ""fits 10-14"" which would not be true, but it should fit American 8-10. My chest is 75C and the top is slightly tight but not critically. Got it for an awesome price too. Very happy!"
"I am 5""4 and 99lbs, my chest is 32c/d
(I'm Breast feeding, so cup size changes)

This dress is EXACTLY as pictured! It is beautiful! I wore a shirt over the dress and tucked the top half In, to wear as a maxi skirt. It was perfect and will be a perfect summer time dress.

The top is a big see thru, but I expected that based off of other reviews.
The dress fits my waist perfect, but I am petite. If you have a small waist line and larger hips, it'll fit you. Think Niki Minaj, tiny waist big booty. That I wish i had!

The waist is this dress has no stretch. Keep it in mind.

I love this dress!"
very cute. just like picture.
"Love the fit of this dress!! This is a Large. I'm 39"" in the chest & 5'3""."
Got this for my brother for Christmas and he loved it! Fit him well!
"I bought a wide width because I don't like the straps across my feet to fit snug.  These are still a little tight, but I'm hoping I can stretch them out.  The sole of the shoe is so comfortable, just wish they were looser."
This sandals have held up great all summer long with my little boy!! Lots of splash pad visits and stomping through muddy puddles :)  I plan to buy these again next year for another fun summer!! Totally recommend for an active toddler!!
Very comfortable and padded well. Love the hidden height and not needing to lace up. I usually wear 8 medium but I felt it was roomier than expected. Not enough of an issue to exchange however.
"Love this bra! If you are full figured, you won't be disappointed"
They great great but just a little narrow around the toe area.  The shoes are great!!
For the price the dress is awesome!
"I wear this under sleeveless things to cover my flabby upper arms.  You can tie it and wear it under your bra for this, or over your bra, don't tie it, wrap the tails around and safety pin them for a smoother look."
"These neon style skateboard sneakers just happen to be the perfect fit for me, very comfortable and good looking, in many colors & textures. and I've been buying adidas for decades, they last me about 3 years before the soul starts to split or wear thin or for any holes to start anywhere on the shoe. this is my second pair, they take a real beating and look and feel great.
As for fit I have to go a bit large, usually I'm a 12 or 12.5 but in these I use the 13 and it gives me a little room. the 12 is too small for me."
"Got them on a Thursday, wore them to work on Friday, ran a 10.5k with them on Sat. No issues at all and very comfortable."
"Great shoe for what you're paying. As long as you understand that the shoes are fake leather you should be pleased. The shoe was very well sized and fit well. I always put insoles into my shoes, and did with these as well. But they seemed comfortable enough either way. I've been wearing them all day with no issues whatsoever.

Please note that these shoe come with a smooth non-rubber sole. Perfect for dancing, and again a great price for shoes with soles like those. You can easily spend twice the amount for shoes like these."
Nice shirt! Price is perfect!
"AWESOME! I wasn't sure about these, but I love them. They have sparkle, and are the size for any adult."
"Cute, my horse-loving granddaughter will love it"
"These shoes have been great, especially for the price. Great control and exceptional comfort."
"love this brand..they are similar to dickies gen flex,they fit well and feel great,they have a flattering fit to any body shape.."
"Beautiful piece of jewelry. Good design ,unique. I like it very much."
Exceeded my expectation due to the modest price!
Better than expected.. Grandson loved!!!
"I'm 6'4"" and over 250 lbs and this is just a great comfortable shoe that is holding up well. I ordered the 12 2E and it fits just a bit large but is perfect for me as I use inserts (Sole Men's Softec Brown inserts). The leather is great quality and the break in period was minimal. I loved these so much I ordered a black pair, too."
Love the tall and snug neck. Very nice layering piece.
So far very good.  We'll have to see how long they last.
These are the most comfortable and practical dress sandal that I have had during my adult life.
"So excited they still make these!...I still have and use my first pair I bought in 1998 (pic): they've gone snowboarding with me at 14k feet, they've helped me explore the deserts of SoCal, they've been with me on five trips to the Channel Islands and to numerous desolate camp sites (as well as ""normal"" ones!), I've worn them in the desert sands outside of Dubai, they've been on several cross-country trips in the USA, and they simply keep on going and going...sure, by now they've collected a couple scratches on the lenses and have some rust-like accumulation on the metal loops on the leather shades, but these glasses are simply the best of the best, esp at this price! It's time for me to get my second pair to enjoy for the next 20 years."
"It's a fun comfy item to wear. The pockets are good for a small wallet or keys, but not a phone. I love the A-line cut. A Small fits well on me at knee-length; I'm 5'1"" and 34-29-36. It does get a bit wrinkly over time because it's a thin material."
Nice dress. Haven't wore it yet. But nice fit and love how it feels on
"Exactly what I was looking for.  Soft, comfortable fabric that offers just the right amount of compression and smoothing.  I had purchased another brand of shaper, but it only offered smoothing without any of the control that I also wanted.  These shorts hold everything in while also reducing undergarment lines.  I wish they were a little bit shorter but am overall very pleased."
"""Ooh honey, I'm never taking this off!"" Yep, that's what she said! My big ole baby loves the Tipsy Elves jumpsuit! I washed it on Friday and here it is Sunday and she is still rocking the jumpsuit onesie! Tipsy Elves you have a fan for life!"
"it's definitely for a girl
wrapping twice fits me perfectly so it may be a little tight for tall/big people"
The heels look good and fit nice.  I wore them out to dinner and even though I wasn't  walking and standing long with them on that night they seem comfortable.
looks good but gave away to daugther
It's a nice big key safe lock box that holds two keys on a small key ring perfectly.  My husband drilled screws through the back of it so we could attach it eye level on a post.  We're using it so contractors can get in and out of a house we're renovating.
Stunning! Excellent quality and a beautiful dress!
"I love these sneakers, however I do feel they run a bit large. I originally ordered them in a 7, but had to return them for a 6 1/2 and they fit perfectly. Comfortable for running around, but not for long walks or all day walking"
"These are just TOO CUTE!!! They are like walking pieces of art. Gorgeous detailed embroidery and I got a neutral color so they can be paired with most outfits. I did have to look at the picture to figure out how I should tie the laces, but just love them to pieces. Also, I'm a size 6 in womens, and this is a size number 36 on their chart, and it fits perfectly."
"Dress is excellent.  Actually it is gorgeous!

Material is more than light and soft.  Looks like better than what is in the photo!

I strongly recommending purchasing this dress or any other from Ever Pretty."
Very breathable and comfortable.
Bought  a pair for me then decided to buy these for my mom and she loves them!!!! Makes her feels like a you girl! My first and favorite pair of distress jeans.
"These socks are so comfortable, and they hold up very well in the laundry.  It's also more convenient to order them online rather than search all day in the stores."
My 11 yo doesn't like high cleats and these are a great alternative for lacrosse. Good support but not too stiff. The heel cup is an excellent idea as they are a little too big right now. I would buy again.
FIT is to size.
"Great Frye boots! Nice thick leather.  These are a more stiff style than the Carson cowboy style Frye boot. They stay up but have a somewhat scrunched look. They hit me below my calf and are not tight at all. No break-in period necessary,  except for scuffing the bottoms which has to be done unless you want to bust your a**. Seriously.  That's when i know I'm keeping a boot--when I'm ready to take em outside and scuff up the bottoms. These look great with skinny jeans or leggings. Perfect heel. The harness strap is great. Very sexy.  Bought black, in my usual size, 9.5 and they fit perfectly for me. I don't like my boots to fit tight. I find these to be very versatile.  Every time i wear them, i get compliments. Probably my most worn pair of Frye boots. Love these boots!"
I've worn these a couple of times now and really liked the way they hugged my feet and stayed on all day. Very comfortable.
True size. very comfortable nephew and really likes it..
"This is useful. this may not be a good idea to wear outside, because it is not warm enough. but it is good if you wear it inside building."
"I got sick of my leather wallet sticking to my phone, forcing me to remove both each time.  This wallet is well built, and very thin.  Unless you pack it full of business cards.  I try to avoid that, but if you have to take 30 around all the time, you can over pack this thing.

Overall, it is very comfortable and I'm very happy with it."
"I wound up buying these in 6 different colors while they were on a crazy reduced sale over Thanksgiving. They fit well. Maybe a fraction smaller than other kd shoes, but it's no problem The only thing was one of the colors I ordered was black patent, and they substituted black smooth leather instead. Don't get me wrong, they are very nice. But I have like a billion pairs of black smooth leather high heels, and didn't really need another (or can one not have enough?). I would have preferred that Amazon acknowledged the problem ahead of time and gave me a choice. I actually then would have ordered a different color. But oh well, I got 6 pairs of Kelsi pumps for about a total of $160. Pretty nice. xox"
"OK. So, I was looking for a very small stud. The size 3 (medium size) is HUGE!!! It definitely was not what I was shopping for, but I decided to keep the earnings anyway. They are very pretty and work great for glaming-up. If you are looking for a small, everyday kind-of-stud, then I suggest you purchase the size 1 or possibly something even smaller"
"I'm a fan of New Balance, and these shoes are up to the standards. They feel good, are a good (true) fit and the quality is as expected in this price range."
Great denim jacket was just what I was looking for on cool days.
"I'm 4'11"" and 90 lbs and this dress in XS was the perfect fit. It is my boyfriend's favorite dress on me by far and it only costs $15- I'll take it! I've purchased this dress in both wine red and grey and love them both."
"Cute boots, but they run a little large. I would recommend ordering a 1/2 size down"
"I can't believe this adorable outfit was less that $7! Hair bows alone can cost as much. I sized up to a 6X for my 5 1/2 year old daughter because some reviews said it ran small. My daughter is 45"" tall and 46 pounds. The 6X is a little big all over, but that's fine as she'll get more wear out of it. Every piece is exceptionally well made. The hair bow matches perfectly and seems to be of a strong elastic. There were no loose strings, all the seams were evenly sewn, and the skirt was tacked down at each pleat on the bottom. The embroidery across the top is well done and the letters seem to really pop out, in a good way. It's a thicker material, but not too thick. This is just precious for all little girls, and I love the fact that it has built in shorts. This may be one of the best deals I've ever gotten on Amazon... and that's saying something."
"This watch looks excellent, but I have noticed it occasionally stops working, then it will start again later. It's mildly annoying, but that's all. Very good watch, worth the price I paid."
Consistent fit and quality. Always a sure bet.
my new fav winter boot
My son loves funny shirts and I bought this for him. He likes it and it fits well. It was delivered on time.
"I bought these for me to wear, I'm 5'8 slender build and have a really hard time finding pajama/lounge pants that are long enough in the legs. These pants fit perfectly and are wicked comfortable. I am in so much love with these pants."
Very flowy and pretty. Sheer through and through so you need to wear a tank top underneath. Mine was more purple than it was blue and the flower print was off to the side instead of dead center like the photo. still like it though!
"Got this as a gift and I love it! It's the perfect size and has an abundance of pockets to keep things organized. Big enough to hold a small umbrella, make up bag and more. It's awesome."
Great Flip Flops. Very conformable
LOVE ASICS SHOES SO COMFY.  I DID ORDER A 8.5 BUT RETURNED FOR A 9.  I NORMALY TAKE A 8.5 IN RUNNING SHOES BUT MY TOES NEEDED A LITTLE MORE ROOM.
Cool meshed hat used for hiking and worked great. adjustable back is Velcro and has awesome  reflective trim
"The veil looks beautiful and is just like the one I wanted from the bridal store that cost over $180. It did arrive with the tiers backwards (the shorter one on the bottom), but that was easily fixed by bending the comb the opposite way. I did that and I love it now! It arrived quickly too even though it came from China. It would have been a 5 star review, but I took off a star for having to fix it myself.

EDIT: I updated my review to 5 stars since my hair and makeup stylist pointed out that the clip actually was correct when I received it and I bent it the wrong way. I guess I didn't know how to wear it properly...lol  We bent it back and it is great. Can't wait to wear it next weekend!!"
Even though it was a size bigger they were small
"Very pretty earrings, just as pictured. Also a little heavy, but that's okay. Came in a cute little blue box. Will be wearing them for my trip to NY!!!"
Love these sneakers but they do run a little small. Wish I wouldve gone up half a size
My son ordered this to take on vacation for a carry on.  It had lots of room.  Just what he wanted.
"I've had my pair of CDB's in Beeswax for a couple of years.  In that time, they've touched land on all the continents of the world.  I find them to be very comfortable and able to keep them on my feet all day without a second thought.  Sure, they could be a little more spongy, but they were ample for me."
I use these all the time. They don't fall down and the color is perfect for use with my flats.
"I like it, the item is comfortable."
"My dad loves these! Great gift for him, very confortable, excellent shape. Well there is not doubt with clarks"
I wear this brand all the time. First time to order from Amazon. Great! Right to frront door!
Very comfortable beach dress. Straps can be worn in a variety of ways for a different look. Travels and washes well. Fabric is light and airy but is not see through.
"I normally wear a size 9, and based upon the return of similar Top-Siders, I ordered an 8.5. PERFECT FIT, and super comfy!!!  Other Sperry Top-Siders have been TOO WIDE, even though I ordered down a half size. These were spot-on in sizing!  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these shoes!!!"
"These are perhaps my favorite earrings, and I have gotten many compliments when I've worn them."
So flipping cute! I love them!
i feel like i could run a mile!
My daughter is 6 years old and she loves her new swimsuit. It fits her just right! It's very pretty!
Such a great dress. It's stretchy and comfortable and fits just right. I'm pleased with the fabric quality and can't wait to choose another one!
"It looks more like gold instead of rose gold, pretty and fits any wrist large or small"
"These were true to size and very comfortable.  They keep my feet warm, without making them sweaty.  I am able to wear them outside to get the mail without having to worry about the bottoms getting worn out.  Although I will be putting them away soon as the hot temperatures are arriving, I look forward to using them when fall and winter are here.  Arrived on time, and will buy again.  I am very happy with this product."
"Hard to wear all day.  the unusual fabric is a bit rough on my soft skin ..  after a few washes with softener I hope they will be better.
Otherwise I think they're  Ok"
"I love the sports bra. I wear it for yoga, running, and biking. The racerback gives me more support."
I love this costume! It fit perfectly. The price was great for a quality costume.
"Excellent quality. I ordered the red and it's beautiful. It looks exactly like what is shown in the pictures. I am 5ft 3 at 150lbs and I ordered the 12-16 US size. It was too loose on the arms and waist area so I gave it to someone and I'm going to order another in 6-10 US size. I'm positive that this would give me a better fit as I already tried on the 12-16.
I would definitely recommend this sweater to anyone who is interested in it. It's very comfortable and warm. Great for winter."
nice as described for the seller
"I have had a few people say they like this scarf. I liked the colors and that it is an endless scarf, plus it is soft to the skin."
Tres 1930's
Nice earring I only wish they were a little heavier!
bought for a themed party for Fifty Shades  nice quality and fits as expected re: size
"I'm 150# and 5'5"". I'm curvy and usually wear a medium in workout clothes but this medium was a bit snug.  I had to stretch it out before wearing it.  If you like fitted then it's a true medium but for a looser fit size up."
"Was not expecting ouch for the price, once I got it I was very surprised by how awesome it was. I would suggest if anyone is looking at one."
Had screen print logo put on here for my business and everyone loves it. looks sharp and feels great
"So comfortable! !! I want these in every color!
Fit as expected."
had plenty of khaki over the years..  always had to cut and make new cuffs.  this is my first blk pairs....
"I was looking for bi-focal sunglasses that I could use with a camera and not have to switch glasses to see the photos. These do very well. The bi-focal lens is attached to the inside of the lens but does not present a problem. Fairly well constructed, good fit with a super hard case for storage."
These are great.  Same quality as the expensive brand.  Love them
"It is a great shoe, although is somehow hot for the summer. The fit is really good. I usually have issues whit my snickers but this one is excellent"
"These heels are STUNNING! I can't say that enough. Get tons of compliments when I wear them, which unfortunately is rare. I will say that when I received them, two of the studs had fallen off one shoe, but when I contacted the seller, they quickly sent me extras. Just not what I expected to see on a pair of heels at this price. I do love them though!"
Highly recommend this seller! Very cute product!
Great Product!  Will buy again.
This product worked perfectly. I was able to hang my jacket from my backpack.
"I love these shoes. This is my first pair of cobb hill shoes, and i am very impressed.  My feet are a true 9-1/2 AA (with a AAAA heel, thus my affinity for open-backed shoes) and the 9.5N in this shoe fits me perfectly.  The arch support is excellent and it's even in the right place to support my arches. They are pretty too.  Velcro is great for me because my feet are so narrow; if these stretch with wear i will be able to tighten them.  I bought them in black, to wear with jeans and pants.  To me, this style doesn't go with a dress or skirt."
i love them nice glasses
Really nice chain...looks great with or without anything attached
Get it with the matching backpack if your taking them to school. It looks hella cool and you'll get compliments everywhere you go. ITS CRAZY!!!!
"Nice socks. They're socks. Amazing, for socks... I guess."
"I wear a size 11 shoe and these stretch enough to cover my big ""hooves"" as I refer to them. My feet are really wide too and they fit no problem. They do not show while wearing flats and provide adequate coverage to stay on as I walk. They have a small rubbery area on the heel that really helps them stay on. I have similar socks from Old Navy that seem to fall off easier and don't cover my foot as well. These are extremely stretchy and stay in place. The packaging says ""bamboo"" and the rest is in Chinese so I'm not sure if they are made out of Bamboo or not, would be cool if they were. I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I will say that I'm sold on them though. I'm willing to spend the few extra dollars to have liner socks that fit and stay in place. If you have big feet like I do you won't be disappointed."
"As with other Louis Raphael slacks I have bought, these pants are well made and very good material. I do see the shade is very odd and a little darker than I would have wanted. I was hoping to have the pattern a little closer to windowpane but it is more like a tight check pattern. All and all I am very satisfied with these very nice pants for the money. The biggest advantage to most Louis Raphael slacks is you can wash them."
"I Absolutely LOVE, LOVE these bras!  The best fit ever!  I love the material and the fact that the adjustment strap is in the front.  For (6) bras for this price and the comfort feel you won't find no where else.  I'm thinking about buying another pack!"
"Just a heads up, I ordered size 12m but the tag on the onesie says 6-12m. Luckily it still fits!! Otherwise very cute onesie perfect for Halloween."
"Very nice mask, made with good quality. I ordered this for halloween, and although it took a long time, nearly 3 weeks to receive, it did make it before  halloween. It looks just like the picture, and fits an average size face. They sell the exact same masks at the halloween pop up stores for $6.99 so this is a bargain."
"I have been lusting for this watch for years.  The price finally came down to a level I could justify for a quartz watch.  Like all Victorinox time pieces, this is a solid item.  Quality control was impeccable and the watch is visually very impressive.  The Ronda movement is a workhorse and I expect it to last me a long time.  I have other mechanical time pieces but I find this quartz watch gets a lot of wrist time.  It's weight combined with it's great looks has me reaching for it a lot.  The lume is like a torch.  Not quite Seiko level but really close.  This is one of Victorinox's best designs.  500 meter water resistance makes this a true tool watch.  If you buy from Amazon, beware you don't get the Victorinox warranty.  You'll probably save enough to buy two watches though so I don't get too bent out of shape about that.  Whatever it would cost to fix, even replacing a dead movement would still be cheaper than paying what they ask for from an ""authorized"" dealer (cost of the watch from Amazon plus repair).  So up to you."
I have these shoes in two colors and will order additional pairs.  They are wonderfully comfortable and versatile enough to wear with casual or dress clothing.
"Love this wallet, so cute and nice sturdy quality. Love the kitties design. Wel made product. I would recommend this."
Perfect. I had a Kenneth Cole Reaction wallet which lasted several years. This is its replacement~very glad to find this new wallet.
"A T-shirt with a beautiful message, a good material and beautiful colors."
"These arrived on time and in perfect condition. They fit a tiny bit big, but if I think if I would've sized down a 1/2 size they would be too big. I love the old style emblem and pattern on the toe. Great shoes and worth every penny!!"
Fit perfectly. They are pretty basic so not much to go wrong.
The anklets do not come up as far as I'd like; they tend to 'crawl' under the heel when walking.  But they are okay.
"36 DD - 56 and 125 lbs - Purchased Large in White. Perfect fit!

When searching for something that would be both classy and functional for an outdoor wedding, I was paranoid beyond reason having to shop online! I simply don't have the time to run to 30 different stores to find what Im looking for (especially if its not in season) so I grit my teeth, read reviews, and took the plunge on this beautiful bolero/shrug. I was so incredibly pleased with this item it was hard to believe they were asking as little as they were! I have no negatives so Im just going to bullet-point all the goodies.

* I ordered a large since I was breastfeeding constantly at the time and was afraid it was going to curl at the armpit, but it didnt! I wore it over a sleeveless dress - another happy Amazon purchase - and it provided exactly the coverage needed to keep covered and not sweat in the 90 degree heat. Honestly shocked that it was so breathable given its material. Had five people ask me where I got it and figured it was a $100 shrug.

* Washes well in cool/delicate, and I threw it in dryer on delicate with no issues.

* Fits both me and my daughter, who has since stolen it, and shes only 53 and 95 lbs. She is obviously the one in the pics, and though its baggy on her she rocks it in a tank top! I still wear it when I can wrestle it from her bony little fingers.

* Fabric is pretty stretchy, so if you're not supremely picky about fit, just use bust measurement since the back and arm lengths don't vary much between sizes.

* SEE PHOTOS: Shoulder to shoulder on Large is around 17 (didnt see that listed in description and that matters to me) and arms are true to post at 24 on the nose.

Overall, a highly advisable purchase, ESPECIALLY since its made in the USA! At this price and quality, I don't know how they do it. But don't raise the price because Im buying more as gifts!!!

Please let me know if this was helpful by clicking the little button. Im not the best at reviewing clothes so I hope this helped!

**Independent review, not compensated in any way.**"
"Beautiful pants but they are baggy on my very thin daughter. :( They will go to my niece who is a more average size. If you have a super skinny little peanut, I would not recommend this style. Levi's does make skinny jeans that look nice on her though. The farah glitter and night out are two styles that fit her very nicely. The trinity style is sort of right in the middle but leaning more on the skinny side. I wish I could find a boot cut style that fits my little peanut nicely but these are not the ones. The search continues! I still love the quality of Levi's jeans though, and will continue to purchase them for my very active kids!"
Provided the warmth need for the cold of winter.
"I have two of these, one in black and one neutral.  I wish they came in white.  I like the open bust to keep from feeling ""smashed"" or feeling like I can't breathe.  This design eliminates that.  I also like that it's long waisted and covers so that there's no visible lines."
This bra fits real to the size and it is very comfortable.
Super cozy and great quality.  Runs a bit long especially but nothing I can't live with.
Good fit and style
"Perfect wallet, better than i expected."
"Pleased, they're a gift."
More of a shirt than a sweatshirt - very flattering and nice!
Love these boots and they look great with skinny or boot leg pants.
"Ordered these in an 8-1/2 for my mom who wears an 8-1/2 or 9.  They are very nice slippers and seem to be good quality and well made, but they were much too large for her ... at least 1/2 a size too large (could fit an entire finger behind the heel.)  I have returned them and the vendor promptly issued a refund (which I appreciate.)  However, it cost over $12 to return ship these slippers (about half of the entire cost) and, in addition, this vendor charges a 20% restocking fee, so I definitely lost money on this purchase (and she still has no slippers.)  I rated these four out of five stars because the slippers seem to be a good product.  Received them fairly quickly and the vendor promptly refunded my purchase (even before receiving the slippers back), but I am not a fan of restocking fees and actually would have just liked to exchange them for a smaller size.  I would rate the vendor slightly less than four stars."
"love mine and couldn't live without it! great way to switch bags/diaper bags, etc. without the fuss of reorganizing."
"Sexy, but wish the tube top had some stay up elastic at the top."
"Super adorable leggings, my daughter LOVES them."
"This tie is very inexpensive, yet made of fabric that is of comparable quality as that of expensive ties."
Order two sizes up for a proper fit. The fabric has nice weight and stretch to it. Nice enough to wear under a jacket to work. I've ordered a few colors already.
"I like them, little loose, but, I can live with it!"
"One of the best racing flats I have owned. I have this pair for just a year now and slightly beginning to break down. However, I interchange them with another pair of Nike 5.0's. I training in them as well and I have to say they are amazingly light with a good soft backheel.  If anything the forefoot lacks cushion, but considering it really is a racing flat, it's spot on for a running shoe."
Nice fit and looks
Bought these as a gift for my 76 year old mother. She loves them! They are beautifully made with the top craftsmanship one would expect from Ralph Lauren. True to size and well priced. Throw on a pair of black leggings and an over sized shirt and mom is killin' it!
perfect for my passport and global entry documents. When traveling I use it for boarding passes & luggage receipts. It is of good quality & the distinctive color makes it easy to find in my bag.
Nice and stays in place
I ordered these to wear 8 hrs a day on my feet and was not dissapointed. They are super cute and equally as comfortable! I wear a size 8 W (when wearing socks) and these fit perfectly. I have worn them several days in a row and my feet feel great at the end of the day. I also like that the heel is made of soft rubber and does not make a lot of noise when I am walking. I can't believe the price on these either! BEST DEAL EVER!!!
Nice material and nice color.
"Wear this all the time for business meetings, so many compliments!"
Very nice . Good quality for the price
Perfect for our farm-themed bar-b-que.  Fit the 6-year-old girls just fine.
Lovely ring. The light blue color nicely compliments the dark metal and wears comfortably and fashionably.
"Looks great & I really liked this purchase, but the cross & chain are CONSTANTLY turning, leaving the cross behind my neck...ugh! And the chain doesn't not move freely through the cross...ugh!"
These are great! I use them on cloudy days while driving. I don't know if they help with night driving but cloudy day driving is good! Look good too!
"Product fits perfectly, I am happy with it and it works perfectly for what I am using it for. I bought a large because that's the size I am in in women's tshirts."
"Regular fit, true to size and length,not tight legged but the loose fit style is way too sloppy looking."
I really like the look of these and my son never complained about them hurting in any way.  Played in them all season with no problem.
Cute neutral accessory purse for the price.
Have been wearing this model of Vanity Fair for years. Perfect fit for me!
"Looks good, accurate"
"The Neff Daily beanies are basically one of those situations in which you get what you pay for. They're cheap and good for knock-around. After awhile it starts showing pilling. I've only had this beanie for 3 months and there is already a noticeable amount of pilling on the fabric. However, I'm not too upset because I didn't pay an arm and a leg for it. The fit is perfect."
"This wallet has an RFID blocking properties in it. Now that all credit cards are required to have a chip, RFID blocking has become essential. The wallet is made of leather. The color is a soft black. The wallet appears to be durable and well made. It has 6 credit card pockets and it has a lift up tab for a drivers license. The main compartment of the wallet is divided into 2 sections which is nice to help organize your money. The only issue I have with this wallet is the crinkly sound it makes every time you open it. That sound comes from the material between the liner and the leather. I presume that is the material that gives this wallet its RFID blocking ability.
*I was provided with a free sample for evaluation, and any opinions stated are entirely my own and I was not paid or told what to write."
Good quality looks tops when wearing. Only issue I prefer to tie with the adjustment holes labeled so im not guessing and trying to tie then adjusting and trying to tie again. Minor issue really since once you have its adjusted odds are you won't be changing it again.
"I bought three pairs - indigo, brown & black.  The blue and brown fit wonderfully on a somewhat curvy person.  The black unfortunately are cut a little slimmer in the seat and legs, just not as comfortable."
"I went two sizes up because I already have the same cardigan which I got from another place. I knew what I am purchasing and like the fabric and fit. Yes, it is see through and very thin, but it is what I wanted. It is wrinkled very easy, but it is viscose! I got light peach color and it is very pretty."
"Easy to slip on and off, this pattern goes with everything and gives my little one a flexible suede sole for his little developing feet as he's learning to walk."
the best work pants out there.  very comfortable.
Average Sock. Nothing special. It works for what I need.
I don't know why I didn't buy these ties before. They are very stylish.
keen is my only brand
"got my new shoes and a free moisture mask to boot, thank you"
"I like these boots also but they smell bad too,I keep them out side until I wear them."
"lost a bet with my team. these are our colors, perfect size, well made"
"Love this new color eggplant and this jacket is of good quality, what I expected from Cherokee. Comes out of the dryer wrinkle free which is great, who has time to iron anymore? I highly recommend and feel it runs true to size, maybe just a little big but a keeper."
my package came sooner than I thought which was great it is a little big around the waist area but I love it
Love it~
"Fantastic shoe. Completely waterproof, durable souls with great traction.  Big fan"
"I love these tanks.  Very nice material and form fitting.  They're not cheap, but in this case I believe you get what you pay for."
SHE LIKE IT
AS described.
So far so good. Easy to handle and fits in my computer bag.
My daughter loves it. It's. Ice and fuzzy on the inside and on the outside there's a cute cat. (These are her words)
"MY HUSBAND NEEDED A SELECTION OF SUSPENDERS IN THESE BASIC COLORS,  HE LIKED THE COMFORT AND THE FIT."
"These glasses are great, I got them because they looked great and they said that they have a large frame. I have a big head so I needed a larger frame because with most glasses I make them look way to small. These glasses fit amazingly and I get compliments all the time on them. They are built sturdy  and they are lightweight and comfortable to wear. The lenses are no joke. by far the best glasses I have ever had. The clarity through the lenses is beyond amazing. I wouldn't trade these glasses for another pair."
They are comfortable. They fit. They are classy and I love the black color with the brown heel and bottom. I am happy and can wear them with dresses and jeans. Love.
"It's nice from afar, buy not too impressive up close.. I have received many compliments, and I can't complain for the price.. but it arrived folded and has a crease that makes it look cheap."
Arrived as expected and very pretty.
Second pair I've bought. Love them.
It's exactly as it looks in photos and described. I bought it as a birthday present from my younger brother and he loved it.
"LOVE, LOVE, Love...
I have been wondering when someone was going to come out with a cone heel oxford.
Miz mooz finally did it. The T-strap style lace up makes it into a sandal / shoe. Great for fall.
The heel height is perfect, giving you a little lift, but still comfortable (due to the shape) The toe is very round and has a lot of space. If I didn't have a wider foot I might think it was a little bit too much room and maybe size down and 1/2 size. I wear a 10 and sometimes a 9.5 with Miz Mooz shoes. I bought the 10 and I think it's perfect with my wide feet.
  The quality seemed excellent, which I have found with all Miz Mooz shoes. Full leather uppers and a great sole.
 I'm so in love!!
*Just added, after wearing these around a little longer I think I could have gone down a 1/2 size to 9.5 from 10. Hmm...not sure. The 10 feels good, but I did notice a 1/2inch of extra space. Oh well, I might try a new color in the next size down.
I'm still in love **"
Love them.  Wish they had more support but for the price they are great
"Good brush, bristles are a bit soft and bent easily, but it did a nice job with the shoe polish paste I bought for my boots.  This works well for shining up the ends, but you will need a larger brush for the rest of the shoe."
I read the reviews and my mother just purchased this for her wedding too. The cups could have been a little smaller but I think they will do for my wedding.
Arrived quickly. Lots of room for boys with bellies. A bit too long. Hemming them today.
"absolutely perfect!  I am 6'1"" and kinda larger breasted.. so it is hard to find cloths... this fits perfectly and is so very flattering!"
Very happy toddler! He wants to wear his blaze shirt everyday. Would definitely recommend.
"comfortable,supportive...Great shoe"
This gladiator sandal beautiful but l try it. It looks beautiful but l will return maybe l lucky to they have in stock #8
"Purchased the wallet to protect my credit cards while overseas and to carry my passport and as far as I can tell, all is well. The wallet is not designed for yu to carry an unlimited number of credit cards so you will have to prioritize which cards you travel with. Beyond that, it held my passport securely and I had no problems with the quality of the material or its design. I would definitely buy this one again!"
"Love this watch! It's cute and small. Doesnt get in the way, perfect for the hospital or in the office! I agree the band isn't super high quality but, not complaints about the rest of the watch."
Awesome! Very warm and stylish!
"My husband got this for wearing under white dress shirts, because he doesn't like when you can see through the shirt to see where the short sleeve of the undershirt outline is.  The edges of this blend seamlessly into the seam lines on the shoulders of his shirts, so it looks like you're not wearing anything under your dress shirt.  It also has a good girdle like effect, which my husband wanted for when wearing tucked white dress shirts with his tux."
Clarks have always been comfortable.
This is my second pair of the trail midweights and I have no complaints at all.  I haven't had any blistering or rubbing to think of on two tough mudders.
Perfect warmth for California winter. Can be worn as a neck warmer or as a hat and transitions easily from one to the other.
perfect for little boys
"Nice sweater, looks sharp."
Very cute and it has also lights whever my daughter walks on them
Best shoe I have ever owned!
"They are effective as advertised. However, they are quite big and possibly ugly, depending on one's taste"
"These black denim jeans are a favorite! These are 96 percent cotton and 4 percent spandex, my favorite blend of the NYDJ. Has the firmness of the denim but the stretch of the spandex. Marilyn petite works perfectly for me. I like the straight legs and the length is perfect for my 5'4"" frame. I bought these in another color also and will continue to whenever I find them on Amazon."
"This is a good quality shirt.
Size is true.
Arrived within a week."
They look spectacular and are very comfortable...
"I entered ""somewhat large,"" but with a caveat---this is a male-sized shirt. I'm a woman, on the thinner side, with a D bust. So, yes, it's bigger, and I expected that. I bought it intending to shrink it in the wash. The complication arose not from the sizing, rather, the large-sized print. Read on...

(1) Material: Like with all official Pusheen tops I've bought (3 Ts including this one, 1 sweatshirt), the fabric quality is soft and excellent. Definitely higher quality than shirts you'd buy at Target or other popular stores.
(2) Fit: I'm happy that with multiple washings (maybe 3?), it now is a better fit on my shoulders and stomach. (I'm 5'5, approx 140lbs.) It also looks nice on my bust (D), but read on.
(3) Print: The image is cute and funny. The print is definitely ""screened on"" in a ""thicker"" way than most printed shirts. The intention is likely that the image will withstand many washes, without fading. ~Yet--with my larger bust, it's a weird feeling.~ The large Pusheen image wraps around and under my breasts, so they feel strangely ""contained"" by the image's heavier imprint material. I've never experienced this effect before. The image may begin ""cracking"" over time with the bust situation, but again, I recognize this shirt was intended for men and my situation is odd. But, FYI for women with bigger busts.

Summary: I like this shirt. I gave it 4/5 stars because it's a terrific shirt, yet the feel with the larger print is strange and unexpected. I won't dock for the overall fit, though, because I knew what I was getting into. Overall, Gund's Pusheen items continue to be higher quality. They cost more than average shirts because Pusheen is ""so hot right now,"" much like Hansel, but I still want to rock a DJing Pusheen."
My husband loves these Clarks.  Easy slip on works when laces are a problem.  Can dress up or down too.  Fit as expected.
I love them. My wife has them both on her keys!
"The shoes arrived and my daughter loved it, but the size was too small. I waited too long to return so gave it to her friend.  Get a 1/2 size bigger than your normal shoe size."
"Love it. No strings. I'm 5'9"" 145 and the XL fits well over sweaters etc. Have it in dark gray and light gray. Looks good over bright colors."
bought these boots for a hiking trip to the Smoky Mountains kept my feet warm and dry
"Very comfortable and durable.  Wore them on a hike and they were perfect, should wear hiking socks with them."
Beautiful.  Great quality. Arrived fast
"Wonderful product, great price"
"It's worth what you pay for it. The center of the pack and the L-shaped frame of the wings inflate. The main surface of the pack is just a layer of plastic. It's a cute backpack, but I did notice the stem to inflate pops out on ours. It's not a big deal, you just have to blow it up again. My son loves it with his costume and it really finishes off the whole Buzz look. If you want something your child can really play with for a long time, then buy the non-inflatable one. This one is fine, but it's not made to last that long."
Ready for some baseball! Durable and roomy.
Fit great. Tight at the ankle... but plenty room at the top and butt area.
"I didn't realize I wore size small, it fits as expected! I will purchase more in the future "
Reasonable price for a good product.
"These are my current off-road running shoes and I'm very pleased with them. After a week-long break-in I used them to run an 11 mile  Tough Mudder and they were fantastic. They were light and the chevron cleat tread pattern is reminiscent of the agricultural tires you'd see on tractors and is fantastic in the mud. I'm a short fat kid but on obstacles like the Mud Mile I was easily passing taller, more athletic people on the humps simply because they could not gain purchase on hills I could simply walk up. At the end of the course I hosed them off and they looked almost brand new, five months later I'm still wearing them to exercise.

The bad: I have hobbit feet and at first found the toe box to be a little restrictive, although it has stretched some and is now fairly comfortable. I ordered the same size as the Gel-1170 Asics I had before, so you might want to order like a half-size larger than normal if you want them to be snug but comfortable right out of the box?

Oh yeah, and these are probably not for everyday wear. The chevron ""tractor"" tread that works so well on loose terrain like dirt, mud, grass, etc? Incredibly slippery on smooth wet surfaces, totally impossible to wear on ice. I've almost wiped out multiple times on our linoleum kitchen floor while wearing these shoes simply by walking back inside with rainwater on my soles. I can only assume that this is because on a hard surface the thick, widely-spaced treads cannot dig down into anything to increase your contact with the ground leaving you with only a fraction of your sole's surface area generating friction against the floor."
"Great fit, comfortable and warm. Exactly what I was looking for in a flannel shirt. You culdn't find a better product for this bargain."
No more lost socks! Great for new babies with skinny ankles. My son is now 6 months old and has chubby enough ankles that he no longer needs these but they were perfect up until now. I would highly recommend these.
Bought this for my niece and she looks adorable in it! So far it has been through over 10 washings after being worn by a very active 16 month old! Hopefully it will make it through the summer season!
I wear these all the time. They're the epitome of a perfect moto boot.
Love the soft fabric.
"Its nice and comfy. wish the arms would be less ""fluffy"" its hard to do anything (washing dishes) without getting it wet, but i think all ropes are like that"
"I needed a bit wider at the toes boots, My MD Doctor who recommended these wares them himself. I no longer have cramped toes!"
This watch is in amazing condition and arrived nice and quick! Definitely love this product! This watch was actually for a gift but I may be borrowing it!
"THESE ARE SOME BEAUTIFUL GLASSES. JUST NEED A LITTLE TIGHTENING, WHICH ISN'T A PROBLEM AT ALL."
"I oredered a size 6 but they run big, I think in reality they are 6.5. Neverteless I like them very much."
"Comfortable, stretchy and fits nicely. I'm tall (almost 5'9"") and about 135 lbs. These leggings fit, without being too tight or loose. I like more of a loose fit rather than a skin tight pair of leggings. I've washed mine several times and haven't noticed any pilling or changes in the fabric."
"As expected these Clarks are great and just what I was looking for! Comfortable, classically casual and perfect for dresses or shorts AND my problem feet!"
The size runs true. The shoe is very comfortable without being heavy. I have another pair of Saucony's so I expected nothing less.
"These are my second pair of this model, haven't found a better option out there. The first pair performed amazingly well through everything I put them through. Great shoes, and well worth the investment."
My 12 yr old son needs men size clothing. Fit right for his height.
"Wonderful sandals,  all jambu shoes are a hit"
The best!!! My Boyfriend compliments me every day I wear it.
As with all Patty 's clothes... Love it!!  Comfortable top with perfect coverage (never have to worry about the front falling open).  Can wear with jeans or slacks.
Awesome tie!
"Love that it rolls up so compactly, has a nice broad brim, and that it is adjustable (most hats are too big for me).  Because it is a visor, though, the top of the head where we don't usually slather sunscreen is exposed to the sun.  For thinning hair, that could be a problem."
"Good looking and well made. I wore it to a summer wedding with a short sleeve dress shirt and looked fabulous, although with my hat I did look a lot like a white Morgan Freeman in Driving Miss Daisy, but I'm OK with that...you need a bow tie, buy the tie..."
Looked really nice.
Small fits as small perfect  and price is right ordered second pair.
"Beautiful. Arrived with the top flower bent and it seems fragile so I don't want to bend the flower back into shape. Nevertheless, it is still pretty and looks like real roses."
Perfect top for those of us with flabby arms and cant wear female tshirts without feeling self conscious. It fits like a tshirt but with longer arms to cover the flab. I love it. Nice soft material as well. I don't know if it will shrink when washing because I dry clean.
This robe was exactly what I was looking for. I am a bikini competitor and was looking for a robe to wear over my suit during competitions. It's not to short or too long.
"Bought for my husband, they seem a little large (nice and long too) but their jammie pants, the more room the better."
"Old school Croakies that work well. They are comfortable and functional. I have been using these or similar for the past 25 years and have no complaints. My last pair lasted for 15+ years before the dried out and fell apart.

Worth the scratch."
"Great bands with many  color  options.  Love having  different bands  to  pair with my timex weekender. Only complaint is that there aren't  even  more color  combinations.  I would love some burgundys,  aubergine. chocolate brown  options."
I buy my sweatshirts one size bigger so that I can wear other clothing like another sweatshirt underneath. This way II can dress in layers during the winter months.
Great school shorts.
"I got this matching set as a gift from my husband. We are using these as an alternative to wedding bands, as his job isn't the best for rings. They are beautiful and unique. I am very happy with them. The ""I love you"" bean was a cute little surprise."
"The fit is perfect for me, snug enough to stay on but not tight. I love the substantial sole, could be worn outside and seems like they will last longer than my previous slippers. I would buy this again."
"No issues, the shirt is just as expected.  Would however be nice if they offered a bundle package, say 3 shirt bundle pack"
Nice well made shoes and cute!
Can't wait to add a couple patches and a big pompom on top!
Nice little shoes for my little man.  I a little bit larger but he will grow into them.
"Exactly as pictured. Not real expensive looking but it wasn't expensive so that's what you,d expect"
"These shoes are very comfortable, the pointed toe is very in style and the diamonds can dress up any plain outfit."
"I received my cape in a timely manner and it was well packaged. It will be a nice addition to my costume wardrobe. My only issue is that the lining is not a true red, but more of a russet color. Fortunately , the party I'm going to is in the evening, so it won't be that noticable."
"The product is beautiful and arrived on time. However, even ordering the size two times too big for the product was still too small. I had to give the item away."
This was a well made product for dressing up for Halloween. My son also plays with it off and on and the quality has stayed. I have even washed it a couple times.
"I ordered a half size up based on many other reviews, but that did not work out for me.  I'm usually a 7.5, but ordered an 8 because many said that these boots run small.  Unfortunately, the size 8 was a little too big/long for me, even with thick socks.  I could feel my heel slipping.  Too bad, too, because they look great, feel very comfortable otherwise, and appear to be of very good quality.  For reference, I wear 7.5 in the Teva Olowahu sandals.  If you can get the sizing right for your feet, I think you'll love these boots.  I haven't gotten around to trying the size 7.5 yet, but will update if i do."
Loved the suit.  It fit surprisingly well
I like European bras and they are often narrower across the back. This works just fine. The list of their other products is a hoot!
Very well pleased with the slides
"Magnifico; excellente; wunderbar; grrreat.  Yes, I do love these boots.  I do not see how they could be any better - for me.  They are quality, through and through, and quite comfortable too.  I think it's obvious - I highly recommend these boots.  Par excellance!  Or something like that.  Get some!"
"My son loved the shoes, he says they are very comfortable, he hasn't complained about the fit. He is very picky about the feel of the sneakers he wears, so seeing how he didn't complain and just kept on plsying and jumping with his new shoes on was a relief."
I like the pattern.
I rarely wear heels anymore so was very pleasantly surprised at how comfortable I was in these shoes. They looked great too!
"These are very comfortable and they fit as expected. I normally wear a size 10 and feel that these run on the small size. I also always size up for boots, so I got them in an 11 and they were perfect. I wore these all day at work (8 hours standing up), and although my feet did hurt a little bit at the end of the day, after standing for 8 hours my feet hurt in any shoe regardless of how comfortable they are.

Super stylish, not too dressy but not too casual. This price is a steal."
"Beautiful!!
Couldn't be happier!"
"They worked well for my son, he outgrew them."
I wear this one A LOT MORE than I imagined: its spectacular!
"The size is a bit large, but I am a thin guy, so yea all good."
"Like the color, fit great with  my helmet , shipping on time,  awesome product."
"Love the bag. The inside (this one has the permanent insert) is made well.  The bag is huge and sturdy.  Would have given 5 stars, but the bottom of the bag has 4 little ""feet""- half round plastic bits to protect the leather. I've used the bag for 1 week and the fake silver came off to reveal the white plastic. A nicer purse would have real metal, but for the price I will happily live with it. Not often somone inspects the bottom of my purse :)"
I like this hat. Lightweight and good fit. A bargain at this price.
Excellent boot!
This is a nice and comfortable sweater. The color is so nice and pretty and it was exactly what I expected. I got it a little big and it was just a little big.
"I absolutely love this little purse!  I wanted something small and protected for my upcoming trip to NYC, yet I wanted to make sure I was able to carry all of the essentials.  This purse is a perfect size and has so much room!  I had trouble trying to visualize the size of it when I was debating whether to buy it, so I took a picture of of it next to a regular 16.9 oz water bottle for size reference.  The water bottle will fit in the largest part of the purse and you can still zip it, but the water bottle would need to be at an angle, and I'm not sure there would be room for anything else in that compartment.

I love that there are so many zippered pockets on the outside to make for easy access for me. The pocket on the back side of it fits my galaxy s4 in its otter box defender case perfectly, and it is not tight where I will have trouble getting the phone in and out, yet is secure and not out in the open.  I was nervous, as I saw some reviews mentioning receiving a product with a strong chemical smell.  Mine is perfect and smells like leather, but not overpoweringly so.  The seller that I went through was Vine Branch. Prompt shipping and prime eligible.  The color is gorgeous (I got the burgundy), and the strap is adjustable but can be set to be pretty long if you want it for a cross body, or shorter for an over the shoulder purse.  I wanted it to sit just at hip level when wearing it cross body, and it is long enough that it could be even lower than that.  The strap is thin and not obtrusive, yet sturdy.  The only negative thing, which is not a big deal to me at all, is that the material on the inside seems cheap and thin.  I'm not going to try to tear it to test it, lol, but it seems like it could tear if you had something sharp in there.  Just a guess though, I could certainly be wrong, and it's not something that you see anyway.  Overall I am extremely pleased with this product.  I don't even want to say that it is such a great item for the price, because I would compare it to much more expensive items and still say it is a great product!"
Adorable! Love this outfit and its super soft
My brother like it very much . The leather is  so soft and the wallet look very nice !
My 3 year old wear a size 9 and I ordered a 10 and the fit with a very little room left. She loves them and the light up very bright. For less than $15 these can not be beat.
I purchased this shirt for our flash mob.  Its a princess fit so it a bit tight but I wear it all the time.
"fits perfect, I love it!"
This one is one of my favorite sports bras! It felts super cute (still sexy) and fits comfortably. I like that it doesn't have cups that can come out because those always seem to fray and separate themselves from the bar. There's appropriate padding where your nipples won't show when at the gym. This is also very cute and I've very happy with my purchase! Great sports bra to own.
Great pair of Nike's.
"Love these sunglasses! Matches with everything, nice fit, not too heavy so it doesn't leave a mark on your nose. I'm usually not one to spend this much on a pair of sunglasses but they will get lots of use. Also comes with a cute case. Only thing to make it perfect would be if they were polarized too."
"This is a really beautiful piece. For those concerned about changing the day of the week or the year, there are 2 little buttons on the left hand side that you can push with a pin. You can barely make out the nubs of the buttons in the picture shown. I question how long the band will last. I bought this specifically to wear at my wedding because it will look nice. However, I might try to turn it into the daily wearer and replace my digital as it really is that good looking of a watch."
"All Gerber products run small.  These are perfect for our 2 month old daughter!  She wears them every night to bed.  Even though it is summertime, I like to keep the house cool.  I can sleep sound knowing she is warm in these long sleeve onesies.  I just bought some more in a larger size for when she gets bigger.  We'll also be able to use them again if we have another child in the future.  They are good quality and seem to last."
"These things work for any barbarian costume, male or female, and they stay on by themselves without any discomfort.  They aren't tight or itchy, and are way more solidly constructed than I expected them to be."
I LOVED THE TOTE
"I recently broke these hiking shoes in on a moderate-to-hard trailthe Adam's Canyon hike near Salt Lake Cityand I'm happy to report the footbed is reinforced so I didn't feel any of the rocks on the trail and the shoe tread was extra grippy. Also, the cushioning and arch support were everything I needed. The low-top style instead high-top allowed for more dexterity on the trial while picking my way up and down some pretty steep, rocky stretches, and strapping on small spikes for icy paths is fairly easy with this shoe. My feet also stayed warm with some merino wool blend socks despite the icy 32 F temps. I admit, Adidas was never really my first choice for hiking but now they will be in the future."
"buy alot of them go a size smaller i wear a large and got a medium because they stretch out, after like 20 mins of wearing them ,"
"These are my favorites! I have these in several colors - but I always choose the silver - It's really more of a shiny beige. They're so comfortable I can wear them all day long. Can't go wrong. Buy them in every color. I usually wear a size 9.5 or 10, so I ordered the 9's and they fit just fine!"
"Love these Vanquish Hoka, these are my second pair of Hokas and I absolutely love them. I give them 1000%"
"so cute, can't wait to wear them - love Hue tights!"
Very warm and comfortable.  More features than advertised and expected.
"Dress is perfect, however, check the seeming one the sides because you may need to grab a needle and thread to patch up a hole or two!!"
"My wife normally wears a 9.
This shoe fits perfectly in a 10.
She loves the shoes."
"Love these shoes! I need closed toe shoes for work and these work great!  I had to put a pair of inserts in because bottoms of my feet were too hot and it works,"
"These fleece pajamas are exceptional. Comfortable, warm, quality fabric with beautifully sewn piping on the jacket and pant legs. The Small runs a bit large for my height of 5' 1"" and 106 pounds. The pant legs are several inches too long, but can easily be rolled up or put inside the top of an Ugg style boot."
"If you like cats these are a MUST. I have been stopped a dozen times plus in the day with compliments and asking where I got them!
They are super cute, fitted as expected. I definitely recommend!"
The finest shoes for my 91 year old mother.
Perfect for my little Princess!
Comfy and good support on the sole.  My son loves it.
"These boots are amazing! Exactly as pictured, fast shipping and sizing is spot on."
Great costume for the price. The cuffs broke when my husband tried to put his hand in but otherwise the costume was great. Love the boot covers so he wear a black pair of shoes and it looked like pirates boots.
Perfect for my round toe heels!
"These wool boot socks are very nice! They seem to be of good quality, and are thick enough to provide some warmth, but not too thick so as to be uncomfortable. I got the gray ones, and they really should go with almost any color outfit. I am about 5'4"", and these fit me great. I actually think they would fit lots of heights fine...I wanted mine to fit just at the knees to peek out above my Hunter boots, so I just scrunched these down a tad and they looked great. I'm not sure if I will be able to wear these on bare legs, because they are a little bit scratchy, but mostly I'll be wearing them over stretch pants anyway so it won't be a problem. They do feel pretty soft, though. Only one thing is iffy about these...it looks like there might be some thread ends that may unravel around the knees, but I'm not sure yet if this will pose a problem, so I won't take off a star for it. Overall, very nice quality. I did get these at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review. All of my words are my own."
"Great hat. Looks great, fits great, great material."
"Comfortable and easy, plus nice looking!"
Well-packaged -- each clip is separated to prevent accidental nicks and scratches. The coating is nice and true to the image.
"I love these things. Straight out of the box, they were beyond comfortable. The stretchy mesh material just seems to hug my feet. I wore them to two different jobs so far and they've passed all of my tests. One job is mostly sitting while the other is fully standing. In both situations, these shoes are very comfortable. The colors are nice and bright. They are easy to put on and take off. I tried to wear them yesterday with very short footie socks and the socks kept slipping off the back of my foot so I just folded down the back of the shoe and wore them that way. Even like that they were a nice fit. They wore just like a slip on. I received this product at a discount in order to provide an honest review.

I know that it's hard to see in the photo but I've had numerous ankle surgeries. There is a big scar up my ankle. I have very weak ankles as a result. That being said, these shoes are great and haven't inpacted my ankles at all. Which I love."
I wear it all the time and it is a beautiful piece. Came quick and I love it. Thumbs up
"Happy Customer, thanks!!"
"very nice pair of shoes, well worth the price. If you have wide feet these are for you."
"I bought this for my husband because I felt he needed some cheering up. He's been sick for several months and felt he needed something to put a smile on his face. It worked! The shirt looks so cute on him. It does run a little small so I would advise going up one size. The quality is good. I'm not real crazy about the polyester fabric but my husband doesn't seem to mind. I love that it isn't a sweater, just has the illusion of a sweater so will not be too warm in a milder climate like we are presently having in St. Louis."
Exactly what was advertised and extremely affordable.
"Came exactly as pictured. It's 2017 and I still have them and they look the same, minus the backs I lost."
"Great Commander Fox costume!  A little cheaply made (as expected), but otherwise very cool.  Here are some details:

Helmet - very stinky plastic smell...needs to air out outside for a couple days. Also, plastic is a little blurry to see through, and tends to smoosh child's nose. Looks good, but no kid would keep this on for very long. Then again, costume looks great even without helmet.

Belt - Is a separate piece that ties on.  It's pretty big, but the tie makes is adjustable.

Fit - We ordered a size small (4-6) for my five year-old who is 3' 8"" tall and slim (40 pounds). He wears a 5 or 5 Slim in jeans and an XS (4-5-ish) t-shirt. Jumpsuit part of the costume fits him well (not tight), although a little long in the legs.  Shoe covers (which are attached) can be folded under if he wants to wear with bare feet, which avoids a tripping hazard as he runs through the house!

Velcro closures - the rough side of the Velcro tends to stick to the polyester suit fabric and is hard to un-stick without damaging the fabric. So, we attach a binder clip to that side of the Velcro (or make sure the Velcro is closed) when we take the suit off so it can't stick to the suit.

Not breathable - the suit gets pretty hot & sweaty, so unless you're wearing in cold weather, you probably don't want to wear a shirt under it.

Body armor - VERY cool. It's 3-dimensional, which is hard to see in the picture, made out of a thin foam/soft-flexible plastic.

In spite of the above ""complaints,"" we still love this costume."
I really like the fit a these jeans.  I am an over 60 body that likes these skinny jeans so hard to find this type jean that fits my body type.  These get it do e
"Beautiful soft and comfortable. Very good quality.
Look at different body shapes to select your size. I ordered 5 of the same body shape for 5'4 140 pounds and all 5 fit perfectly. The sixth pair that I ordered for a more curvy hips was too large and too long."
SO TIGHT!!!!!!
I put cathodic insoles in my shoes. The shoes are light a colorful.
"I love ASICS shoes.  I have worn them for the past 10 years.  However, do not purchase the low end ASICS for sports activities.  Purchase the higher end models for the needed support, stability, and cushion.  Make sure there is gel in the front and back."
I have the most sensitive ears ever and was worried I wouldn't be able to wear these.  I've worn them everyday since they arrived last week with no issues!!  I love the small size.
I like this bag.  I have a handbag that matches. Clearly not just for men.
"Good quality footware. I suggest that you buy 1 size smaller than you wear though.. Because after some amount of wearing it tends to feel alittle slack. And even when i tried it on just after i received it, it felt alittle bigger than what i wear. I remedy the problem of it being slack by wearing a thick socks. Good luck"
The handbag inside is great with the compartments and it is so stylish.
"My husband has wide feet. This is the third pair of slide sandals I bought him for his birthday. The other pairs were adjustable with Velcro and yet he still couldn't walk right in them. (Seriously, I couldn't stand the sound of him shuffling around in them.) These were perfect! He is Cinderella now! And, sheesh...these were a lot cheaper, too."
These make walking all day doable.
I gave these as a christmas gift the lady said they were great out of the box and I think they look very good on her. Justin makes a great product and I will be buying again for me and my lady.
Love the texture and is very comfortable. The size was a little too big.
LOVE these yoga pants for my little one. They're super soft and fit true to size.
I love this wrap and wear it both with my swimsuit and as a scarf with normal outfits. The color is beautiful as well and didn't fade at all.
"These shoes are by far my favorite. Not heavy, great traction, the sole is not wearing. I love these."
This pants are true to size and they fit really well. They are rather heavy cotton and they seem very durable. Great product and we got them at really good price in Amazon.
Love this top beautiful design and very good material
They're really comfortable and very cute!
love it fits perfect wanna get more in different colors.
"These shoes are so comfortable!  I am a little concerned about wearing them when the ground is wet as I am not sure how they will hold up.  They have some personality but still work for a business casual environment.  There is not much support, but I would prefer to be in sandals year round so that doesn't bother me much."
Very cute and flattering!
"Below is the review of the orange Teva with the black footbed.  This all-blue one is almost the same, but the straps are looser.  The blue straps do not seem as sturdy as the orange woven straps.  However, I still like them.  If I buy another pair (and I might because I love them), I will probably buy the ones with the black footbeds.
*I bought a smaller size than normal.  I usually wear a 10, but bought a 9 because the length of the footbed was the same length as the footbed of a size 8 Teva Men's Universal Sandal that I already own.  The footbed is fine, but the straps are a little tight.  They are stretching though, and I think they are going to be fine after a couple of weeks.*"
I'm 5'4 150lbs. 12 p fit perfectly
Very pleased. Goddess work jeans
"Slim-fit checked shirt that is PURPLE - not blue.  The checks are very small, smaller than the picture portrays it. All-in-all though, it's a very nice shirt, well made, practical."
Daughter loves these nylon mesh shorts.  The graphics are great.  She loved them.
just as expected . love it
Omg absolutely beautiful
I LOVE how these scrubs feel when I'm wearing them!!!
"just got em, love em, all the boat shoe snobs at work actually gave me a two thumbs up, the sporty looking laces and blue stripe on the bottom have made for a distinct look, and even the sperry guys said they might give em a try."
Vibrant color! Great fabric!
"I got so many compliments on this hoodie, I just love it! Perfect for my work-appropriate unicorn costume."
"This item is a gift and you can not go wrong with a little larger slipper then it being small, these gives him the amount of room he looking for and they are comfortable and that's is important to him."
"Small bag- which I knew. Regardless, if I could have reasoned all the things that were essential to a bag smaller than I usually carry, this would be the bag! Someone really thought this through! The ruching on the front gives it a really good look! Simply a functional, good quality bag! Fantastic for nights out, concerts, running around with friends on those insane but fun shopping days, etc. Highly recommended!"
they fit great and I got them for a very good price.
"I already owned a pair of these with a black frame and darker lenses.  I wanted to keep an extra pair in my car and the price was right on these ones with a rose colored lens.  Now these are my favorite ones.  The rose lenses are perfect for driving, especially if you are light sensitive or prone to headaches."
Bought as a gift for our mother. She loved it!
"Heavy, sturdy, and a perfect addition to my Victorian Halloween costume. The necklace was a perfect match. The set was well worth the money. These will last for years!"
"great hat, love material..for the price an awesome buy!!"
"As someone with wide feet, it's very difficult to find shoes that aren't sneakers that are comfortable and durable. These shoes have preformed very well in the rain, snow, and sun. I wouldn't wear them to walk directly through a swamp, but they keep my feet dry when walking to class in a downpour or walking across a damp grassy area. When it snowed here the traction provided by the rubber sole held up really well on the ice, and all I needed were fuzzy socks to keep my feet warm. When I wore them on a warm day my feet didn't feel sweaty at all. I can throw these shoes on with leggins, jeans, or a skirt and they look wonderful. In addition, they look so much nicer than sneakers. I'm usually out an about from 7:30 am to around 10pm and these shoes are so much more comfortable than most flats. Definitely worth the price. A nice plus is that even though I have walked through countless damp fields and mulchy pathways, these shoes don't look droopy at all.
The color on my shoes is exactly like the picture. They arrived quickly and broke in in about 4 days. They are the perfect everyday shoe for me. I would recommend these shoes to anyone!"
Best slaps for the money.  Slaps are my primary footware.  I where them almost every day. I tried many brands and a couple Olukai models.  These are the most comfortable and well made I have ever worn.  These are so good that when my last pair wore out after about 2 years I purchased the exact same model.
Very good but priced too much
I luv them!! I read prior reviews and decided to go with my actual size. They were a little snug (which is expected for a brand new shoe) but after a few hours they loosened up. They are true to size. They are also very comfortable.
These are super soft underwear!  My son does not like tags and is very sensitive to elastic.  These are great underwear and worth the price. He also loves the colors (exactly like the photo).  My son is almost 8 years old and the size 8-10 fit perfectly. I've washed them a few times already and they still look great.  I will buy more of these underwear for him.
"I was apprehensive about the size after reading previous reviews. Some said too big, some said too small. Hard to determine size based on feedback.  Mine fit me just right, ordered a 10 1/2 and they fit just fine.  Quality is great. Boots are comfortable. Very happy with my purchase."
Buy in advance of your event so you can break them in! They are gorgeous and worth the effort.
These are great shoes and price was even better!
"Great Quality, Great Value, Great Size All Purpose Tote for work, weekends, carrying children's toys etc. I was looking for a black casual tote in place of using my regular weekly bag; this tote fits the bill especially for the price.  Purchased others and returned just not being satisfied and didn't want to spend a lot.  Happy with purchase finally hitting it right.  This total has no odor, well constructed and great size to carry just about anything fitting comfortably over shoulder (has no inside pockets).  Did have a small problem with opening the zipper that was tucked in to close to side seam at first but after trying a few times zipper came lose and  opened and closed just fine.  Some reviews mentioned it had no lining but honestly it really doesn't need one.  Strong and sturdy.  Certainly worth the price and recommend.  True to picture."
"Moccasins are super cute, great quality, fit perfectly! Highly recommend!"
"I bought a second pair. Comfortable and versatile. I've worn them to the office, on the train, to yoga, and to a fundraiser car wash, for example. Good brand. High quality, but not indestructible. I notice some breakdown of the fabric where legs rub together. This is after wearing them 6 to 8 times."
"I needed a hat for a Mary Poppins event and didn't want to spend a lot of money.  This had came relatively fast, considering that it was shipped from China.  It was folded up, yes, but the creases smoothed out after I shaped it.  I added flowers to it and it worked great.

I was going to give it to the thrift store, but never got around to is.  Which was fortunate, because my next costume - I HATE costumes! - was as a little old lady from ""Arsenic and Old Lace,"" so I plopped it onto my white hair and it worked great, again.

I still have it - ya never know.

I""m sorry some didn't smooth out.  MIne did.  And the price was certainly right."
The feet looks big with this shoes and they fit great
"Great light, comfortable, nice shoe for running or running errands.  The pop of mint helps to make this shoe more feminine, and the dark colors help camouflage any dirt or stains that might get on it.  Good foot pad support, and it has the average arch support of most athletic shoes.  Maybe an insert would help if you have high arches."
Love the variety of colors. Was delivered quick and also nice customer service they were so sweet !!! Thank you! Will order more.
Very nice pair of silky pajamas. Very comfotable and stylish. I am very happy with this purchase.
"Awesome well made belt for a fat guy, gets the job done without killing me.

I shouldn't be so fat."
Saw it on Pinterest and searched high and low for it.  Found it here and snapped it up.  The large is PERFECT.  Worked extremely well as a gift and was well appreciated.  Will definitely order some more for gifts around Christmas.
True color and very comfortable shoe.  Can wear them all day.
"This was the first time I ordered an Alex and Ani for delivery.  I am very pleased with the purchase, it arrived packaged nicely and was exactly what I wanted.  I purchased this as a Christmas gift for someone and I am sure she will love it!"
"I wanted some simple, basic, affordable bralettes and fell in love with these. I have several and really like them for any time when a bralette will do, which for me is most of the time. They don't give you the best shape in the world, but they're not supposed to. They're pretty comfy, at least for 6-8 hours. If I wear mine longer, the skinny straps start to cut into my shoulders a little. I have found these bralettes will last at least three years before some hair-like pieces of elastic start to emerge from the fabric and trim. That doesn't bother me if there's just a little. I have kept these bralettes for four or five years before replacing them.

I hate throwaway clothing and I'm really grateful to American Apparel for making pieces that last!"
I wore it for a costume as a goddess and it looked great! I actually wish it was a bit longer. I cut a slit in it for sex appeal and added a body chain and it turned out great. Great dress for the price and it was pretty lightweight and breathable.
"Fit perfectly. No problems.
Love it. Thank you."
I bought these in yellow for my daughters Halloween costume. They looked great. She was comfy. I'm sure that's the only time she'll ever wear them. They worked out great for what I needed them for.
Perfect fit for me and very comfortable!!! Well worth the $.
"It seems to be made of real leather and of a single piece, not the cheap layered kind glued together. A little long. I bought an extra large for my 34-36 inch waist and it is maybe 2-3 inches longer than I need. Definitely better than anything I have found off the rack for twice as much."
"some of the better socks i have  owned in my life.
i really enjoy them, only with all the pairs would stay together in the wash."
"I really like these shoes, they are cute, comfortable, and great for the trails.  However, the rubber on the toe came away from the shoe my first week of wear. I really do like these shoes, they are such a great price, and I feel like it was a fluke, so I'm giving them another go again. I returned them and Amazon was excellent about the exchange."
"Wanted a one-piece cold weather glove. This was definitely the answer, but I found that my hands were so warm they were sweating. These make it easier to use your hands for grabbing/lifting, etc. than a two-piece, but the insulation is so thick that my hands were sweating in low 40 degree weather. Wore them a few times during a long rainstorm and, yes, they are waterproof. I still prefer two-piece gloves for comfort but can see how these would be helpful when hunting/camping in very cold weather. The camo pattern is awesome."
"Great quality, love the thickness of the material."
I love these so much I bought 2 pair!
Great looking box-worked well.  Wife was happy.
They are (one size) but didn't stretch enough for me so I had to give them to one of my daughters.
"Seem to be well made, but are VERY small ! Can barely see the stone color."
"This is the best handbag for someone on the go! It's so roomy & easy to clean, that I wish I would have bought it sooner!"
"Update: I have given these boots to my sister. Her feet are slightly smaller than mine, so these boots are definitely either made smaller or they are mis-sized somewhat. Still, I need to order a size larger next time. If I can ever find these Bearpaw Chestnut Distressed  Emma shirt boots again. Love the distressed leather!

Previous review:
I have several pair of these boots and have never had a problem with putting them on until I received these. I have requested a return, but unfortunately a size larger is not available in this particular color (chestnut distressed).  The problem I had with these is that the shaft is so small around I cant get my feet down into them.  Hoping this is just a flaw on one pair of boots. I may try to order them in this same size in a few weeks. Will gladly change this review when I get a pair that fits. I love Bearpaw boots and have never been disappointed until today. Huge disappointment!"
I'm happy to be able to wear these type of jeans.  Losing 85lbs gave me the confidence to go for it.  I'm glad I did.
I love these shoes!!  They are really cute and fashionable.  I normally wear a 7 but ordered a 6.5 after reading the reviews.  They are a perfect fit!
"Love this sweater!  Nice quality, not itchy, fits great."
These are perfect! Except they run small I bought diff rings and the are all so tight it's cuts blood circ off. I  have to check to see if they have half sizes as a whsole one would be tooo big!  Beautiful though!
Beautiful skirt I love it I will be ordering more. I would say it is true to size.
Very pretty! Quite thin.
Use them daily.  Fits comfortable.  Feels just right.
"I love tank tops and love that his style has a higher neckline and a nice cut around the hips.
The fabric is wonderful and layers very nicely.
Thnaks"
"I am very happy with these pants. They are nice and  warm. Not hot. Keeps the wind off my legs. They fit well and look nice. The thermal part washes well and keeps it intended shape, so they keep me comfortable even after washing. I don't put them in the dryer. I hang for drying. They are dry in a day. Again I am very happy with these pants. I will buy them again."
"I've purchased a few of these type of belts and the combination of the buckle and the thickness of the belt itself is the key to how smoothly this is going to work for you.  And this one...is PERFECT!

Plus, because it slides in and out of the buckle instead of  having to be pulled like old fashioned belts, it doesn't wear almost at all!

I love this belt and I can't imagine anyone not feeling it's the best belt they've ever used!"
"it does like to sorta stay wide open unless you zip up the top zipper, but, all in all what a great bag for the price!!! I can fit quite a lot in there, like my thermos and ipad, and I can also configure the strap in a way that will let me wear it like a backpack on my bike. Hardware seems sturdy as well."
I tend to lose these little guys often so I bought a big package. I've had these almost a week now and my nose ring still hasn't fallen out or even slipped half way out which usually happens when I wear these. I expect to have these a very long time. YAY for bulk buying!
"These earrings are very pretty, but I think they are too expensive for what they are. They are plated, not full silver, and they are quite small (see my photos for size compared to a penny).

The clasps on the earrings are good; I don't think they will pop out of your ears.

The box is quite large for the earring size. I would recommend that the seller put them in a smaller box, tho the box and packaging is quite nice."
I have 'weird shape' face and it's very hard to find  good fit sunglasses. But these are perfect.
"The shoes are comfortable and nice, but the fit me pretty tight even when I purchased my real size. I don't understand why it didn't fit me as I expected."
"Easy on and off, reasonably warm, they wear like iron."
"My fiance loves his new ring. He loves the fact that while he is at work and misses me, he just looks at the engraving on the inside and is reminded of how much I love him."
"Nice gems, overall happy with them.  Got a couple big ones, order from gem market a few times."
I shopped around for these shoes. I went to multiple malls to look for these. I tried these on to make sure the size is accurate. I found them cheapest on Amazon. Had no problem with size.
I love the fit and the material.  It launders well and always looks nice with jeans.
"These shoes are great!  Not the most comfortable at first (a little narrow, a little tight) but when you break them in they're awesome.  Stylish, comfortable.  Love it."
Perfect shoe.  The leather is absolutely perfect and so durable.
The material is silky. It feels good on.  I received several compliments on it.  I were jeans with it.
"I love all things owls, so when I saw this I knew I had to have one! It is well made and I have had a lot of positive feed-back about it. I am very happy I made this purchase."
Comfortable somewhat tailored fit and long below waist is a big plus !!!
"Love it, looks exactly like the picture."
"Perfect fit for somebody who use to buy Columbia's shirts. If not you have To select a size small er than you use. For examine, I use large in others shirts. In Columbia I use medium and fit me perfect"
"This shoe is great; however, it fits somewhat small, but I think it will get better since it is made of leather, and leather expands with time."
It was gorgeous.  But xs was baggy on me.  Great product.  Well made.  Wish they had a xxs
Cute sunglasses! Just as described!
Always a good thing when you get 25 tongue rings for a great price!  Shipping was fast.
"Bought this pair for my son, and it fits perfectly! Seems to keep his feet warm without all the heavy bulk. Not cheaply made at all. Very sturdy. Would definitely recommend to others."
"My 2 year old son loves Superman (although he's never even seen a superman cartoon). Anyway. This a very cute umbrella. Perfect size for a toddler. However, when it arrived the shaft was bent and some of the paint was already coming off of the Superman on the handle. Luckily, I was able to bend the shaft back. My son loves it, and it was cheap...so it was overall a good buy."
"these are awesome, bought for my little mans easter outfit, super cute!!! :D"
I got this for my wife at her request and she says she loves it. Fits great and nice material. Comfortable all day at work she says
Bright color.  Great size.  Goes perfectly with beach bag by Scout.
"Very pleased with this t shirt. I will order more colors in the future. This T shirt is not tight through the midsection, so it offers a flattering look that spares revealing too much!"
"They're thin, but the elastic is okay. They wear decently well."
"I have been wanting these FOREVER and finally received as a gift I was beyond HAPPY :) I have worn Dr. Martens FOREVER I still have my original 8 eye boots from 1992 which fit AWESOME and anyone who wears knows these will basically form to your feet after wearing for so long and Dr. Martens last FOREVER!!! I LOVE these Maryjanes :) Besides being absolutely ADORABLE they are beyond comfy!! I ordered my normal size US 7 and they fit as expected, they did need a little breaking in but again most Dr. Martens do as they will arrive a little stiff. I love Love LOVE these shoes :) I can dress up or down and I can wear these with just about anything. The shoes run very true to size for a womens shoe. I can wear these ALL day with no problems. I also love that I am able to drive in these, most times I have to wear my Uggs or Nike sliders when driving then change into my nicer shoes but not with these. They aren't too bulky or chunky which was a concern, I thought my feet would look like boats but nope, sooooo CUTE I'll be getting tons of wear from these Maryjanes :)"
I bought this ring for my brother.  He wears it whenever he goes out.  I guess that means he likes it!
"Fits and looks great, I added a cute red belt and it turn from casual to business ware."
They are warm and comfortable but they eat my socks.
"I love this purse. I recently took a 10 day coach tour, and this purse held everything I needed, plus it had room for more. It was comfortable, and I felt very secure with all of its safety features. I plan to use it as my everyday purse. If you plan on doing any traveling, this is the bag for you."
"Very fragile, guess this is what you pay for."
Helps the squeeze around the  middle!
These boots are warm for our subzero temps even without the second pair of socks.  The best pair I've ever warn and good on our icy parking lots.  They arrived quickly and the dealer was a pleasure to buy from.
"Very comfortable shoes. Purchased several different brands around the same price around the same time. These are hands down the most comfortable heels I've ever worn...including the most recent, comparably priced heels."
"best flip flop ever, and I don't ""flip flop"" over my flip flops."
Durable and a great fit.
"The size is perfect for ever day wear and the color is bright,  The cut shows the sparkle of the stone."
Great shoe.  Great in the snow.  Sturdy....comfortable to wear.  Downside?  Just a tad on the heavy side.
They're not the greatest but they get the job done. A bit tight on the thighs but still hold their self in place which is nice.
Purchased as a gift.  I'm sure he will like it and find it useful on upcoming trip.
GREAT SHIRT!! I wear this out all the time now and I love it!
"I bought this for my son - 2 1/2 years, but small for his age. He weighs about 24 lbs, and it fits perfectly. The felt hood is about what I expected - sewn felt in a conical, hood shape with no straps. This would literally blow off his head if he walked past a fan. However, the addition of some velcro tape and a plastic Darth Vader mask will match everything up perfectly.

Why 4 out of 5 stars is only because the leg closures (diaper-changing necessity!) have velcro tabs. I took it to a tailor to have those replaced with snaps and problem solved. Cost me $5. If you are handy, you could probably do this yourself for less, but I am not handy. The velco on the legs is a problem because the rest of the fabric readily adheres to it - kid takes two steps, and his legs are bare. But, with that exception, it really is perfect!"
Look great but run small
Fits well. Soft light weight.
So cute and durable.
Definitely a nice longer tank. I would order up a size or a few depending how you plan on wearing these tanks. I will wear under another shirt or sweatshirt so the snugger fit will work fine for that...
"The stone part is very beautiful, however the chain with the woven material is not my favorite. It takes away from the beautiful pendant."
This shoes are extremely comfortable. I am waiting for my size to be available in other colors so I can get more!
"Love them!  As I age my panties tend to roll down, making discreet adjustments rather difficult at work.  I put them on, they fit perfectly and I am ordering more!  Worth the price!"
"very breatheable, soft and comfortable"
"Great Material, excellent fit!! lots of compliments!!"
I had tried another type of extender but I had to cut the corners off because they were uncomfortable. These extenders were just like what I expected. They work perfectly and comfortably.
36D - my prosthetic fit perfectly.  I would say that this product runs a bit small so if you have a broad back you may want to order a size larger.
"Kat says these shoes are have the usual comfort, style & durability that Clark is known for; They will last a long time.  Because of the color, they have some limitations, but are great for that perfectly matched ensemble."
"Very lightweight. Fit about right. I've worn them only one round but so far, very good."
I have a narrow foot and it hard to find a running shoe that fits snug and is comfortable. These shoes fit great and look amazing on. I spend lots of time on my feet and at the end of the day my feet do not hurt as they have with other shoes. Two thumbs up
"Great for low cut or just eliminate bra, super easy and convenient."
These shoes are versatile and comfortable. This is my second pair and they are my go to shoes for everything from running errands to strolling with friends.
"Cool, eye-catching style! Of course, for the price, you aren't getting luxurious materials, but still a cool pair of shoes."
"Good watch for the money.
I've always worn fossil, this watch not quite as heavy, which is a con for me. the funny thing is, the lack of weight is in the metal band, it is lighter and flimsier than the metal bands on the Fossil watches. And one less clasp....no big deal so far.
the chronograph dials are non functioning. Idc.
also, it's a little noisier than the Fossil. All that said, this watch was half the price.
size of face is perfect...luminous hands very visible in the dark.......good looking watch."
"I searched high and low and returned numerous sunglasses that didn't fit my face (male, small face).  These were the only ones I finally kept.  Most of the Aviator sunglasses are way too big and sit on your cheeks and look ridiculous if you don't have the right sized face for it.  These fit really well, and they're also very light, and look great.  Also, the gold colour I got (gold frame, green lens) looks great and isn't ""too gold"" or flashy."
"I love this hat and always get compliments at the pool. Helps detract from my humble mom bod and elevate my entire swim style. I have a small head, and this fits perfectly for me. Small headed ladies, add some volume to your look with this cap, that creates contained drama."
"I absolutely love this bathing suit! It is so cute. I purchased it because I needed a cute one piece to water ski in. I feel so sassy in it!

(UPDATE) The stitching in the back started coming apart! =(  Nothing like showing a little butt crack on the boat.  That being said, it got a lot of wear.  Broke my heart!"
"Cute shoes! I can't wait to wear these when we start to have a little more spring like temperatures, plus they look more like spring and summer shoes to begin with.  In the meantime, I've been wearing them around the house to break them in. Pretty comfortable."
"I love this necklace! Its awesome! I like the Stone
A lot!! Thank you so much!"
"I love these little coin purses! I bought one for my best friend also, she loves hers too!! My wallet coin holder wasn't big enough. I was always having to dig out change. This is nice a deep."
"The general fit was good. I need a slightly shorter sleeve length.  I wish this coat came in a petite plus size.  Other than that, the coat looks and feels great.  The seller was efficient and timely."
"This was my first ""high-quality"" watch that I purchased and I'm glad I bought it. It's hard to appreciate the build quality and elegance of the watch from the photos -- you really have to see it in person and wear it on your wrist to see it.

The hands line up perfectly (which was not the case for my lower-end watches). The chronograph feature works very well and the buttons have a great snap to them.

I have an average build (5'10"" 160 lbs) and the watch fits perfectly -- not over or under-sized. The weight is perfect also -- not so light that you can't notice it, but not so heavy that it's bothersome.

My only complaint was that I didn't like the band that came with it. The leather was a little stiff and the buckle was kind of hard to use. I actually purchased a Hadley Roma leather band with yellow stitching (also off Amazon) that looks awesome with the watch! Also, the illumination doesn't stay bright for very long (maybe about 2 hrs on a full day's charge)."
These have held up so nicely from last year.  I wear them to football games or bopping around town.  I'm 45 years old and these don't look too young.  They just look and feel very comfy.
"Pretty, sparkly and also a very decent size. There is also a nice scroll like pattern in the setting of the stone."
Love this shirt and got bunch of compliments
Those boots are perfect.
I wore to church one night and my preacher said I like your shirt. Very impressive! 
"Great cap!  It is ""shallow"" and fits my 2.5 year old's head perfectly with room to grow.  I did buy the 4-7 size based on a customer review and was very happy I did."
"This dress fits about the same as any other toddler sized dress I've purchased for my daughter. I'd say the length is about on par. It's generously sized through the chest(has a knit cotton upper, so it's plenty stretchy) and hips, and drapes nicely. My daughter is a fairly large 2 year old and wears the 4T with plenty of room to spare. She's about the size of many 3 or 4 year olds in height and weight.

My only complaint is the flower on the shoulder does not stay flat. The petals are all wonky and would require ironing I'm guessing. I don't really mind much. It's a dress on a 2 year old that likes to play in the mud. So, not a big deal for us. Overall, nothing huge to complain about. I'd definitely purchase again."
I like them a lot. Very comfortable and fit grest.
I ordered these and the Russell Athletic Men's Cotton Performance Baseline Short. These fit better at the waist and do not roll.
i bought this because i love swarovski crystal.  purple is my favorite color and this is great because the necklace is not too long and the earrings are not heavy at all. plus not bad priced either
"Navy Blue is the way to go with your Timex ""Weekender"" - Switched out within 60 seconds."
"I love this wallet. It is big enough to hold everything I need. I have read a couple of reviews that say it isn't big enough to hold an iPhone. Unless it is absolutely stuffed with other things, my iPhone 6s fits perfectly in it. It is pretty, and I like the fact that it zips closed all the way around. I would recommend this wallet."
"These shoes are beautiful!!  The color is just as I expected and they feel great on my feet..also with this heel height, I thought it would be difficult to walk in them but they are very comfortable.  Glad I ordered them!!"
"These fit well, and are true to size... love the stretch they have and they won't fade"
"Alegria shoes and sandles are the brand I wear now, due to arthritis problems.
In all the other styles I have, a 38 fits perfectly (I wear a size 8 US), but these are quite a bit looser, causing me to slide around if I am not wearing a thick sock.  I bought them to wear more as black dress shoes, but with hose, the shoes are really loose.
The totally cellular color is great, and I get compliments when I wear them."
"This hat is nice, but it is cut small.  My head is normal size and it's snug.  I don't mind this because I bought it for shooting (guns), so the short brim and fact that the sides don't hit my safety glasses are a plus.  I love the adjustable velcro in the back.  Great hat overall."
"Bought this watch to mount on the dash of my adventure touring motorcycle and it is perfect. Bright, easy to read and waterproof at a very reasonable price."
Absolutely adorable!! The material is thick and will keep my son warm on Halloween night.
The tab is just what I expected.  It arrived in a reasonable period of time and it always generates the comments it was intended to generate. I bought it because I am.....That Guy
"Was a Christmas gift for my husband. He LOVES it. Very nice looking, quality material. He said people keep asking him where he got it at, holds a lot of money inside and 1-2 cards on front and rear side."
"O. M. G. I can honestly say I have never worn more comfortable underwear in my life.

I don't like to spend a lot of money on underwear, and my standard has for several years been off-the-shelf multipacks of Hanes or FotL. But they stretch and sag over the course of a day. When retail outlets stopped carrying single-color packs of them (I don't care for dark-colored underwear, and the mixed-color multipacks always have a dark color in them, usually black), I decided it was finally time to look at something a bit higher up the ladder.

I found these here on Prime Day 2017, when they were roughly half their usual price. The reviews were overwhelmingly positive, so I decided to splurge and buy four packs while they were on sale. I figured I'd open just one pack, and if I didn't like them, I'd just return the other three. (I'm not crass enough to try to return underwear that's been worn, even if it was for less than a minute.)

Needless to say, I won't be returning them. Thanks to the spandex content, they don't sag at all after a full day's wearing. The material is incredibly soft and comfortable, so much so that I now wonder how I put up with the coarser material of the mass-market stuff. They don't appear to have suffered any significant effects from washing. Some reviews have complained about the sewn-in logo tag, but I haven't had any issue with it. They are, quite simply, awesome. I will be buying more at the regular price (which is still lower per pair than many of the higher-end brands), and will continue to buy these as long as they are available (assuming the quality remains the same).

As for the eco-friendly marketing, well, I'm too cynical to believe that any of it is true just because they say it. I'm not saying I think they're lying, but most companies that tout the ""green-ness"" of their products are at minimum exaggerating. So my recommendation doesn't take that into account, either pro or con. I recommend these based solely on the quality of the product I gotand that quality makes them worth every cent of the price."
Nice boys jacket. Very satisfied
"Well constructed and durable, this is the second flight suit like this that I have had and it has treated me well and hasn't had problems with ripping. The only drawback I had with my first one was the zipper pull tab on the shoulder pocket came off but was easily fixed. It is a comfortable fit and isn't stuff or restricting."
"Very light, I can actually run in these if I needed to.  My foot is a little wide so TopModa shoes are too narrow for me.  Forever Adriana shoes have the perfect amount of room for me.  I actually bought a second pair when my first pair was destroyed in a series of unfortunate events, and I love my second pair even more."
Easy on and off for a user with Parkinson... was happy to see this size sock as a lot of stores only offer size6-13 and those run small. (of course). This sizing works
These are adorable! I got them for my 3 month old daughter and they fit perfectly. They are stretchy enough to continue to fit her until shes a year old Id say. Good quality and I love how big the bow is
"This made my little one a ""true"" princess for her birthday but did require some ironing (on a LOW setting)"
"My husband bought this for me for when I walk our dog in the mornings. Am I a big  lady? no. Would l wear a size large ladies hat? Yes. Would I wear a mans size large hat? No.. But there is no way it would fit a bigger man than me..
Runs really small."
"these are really nice shoes. the price was reasonable, maybe nobody wants gold? the heel is low. it's hard to tell what the color is from the picture. the main part of the shoe is basically gold, the toe is more a bronze color. i bought them to wear to a wedding without much expectation that i would wear them a 2nd time. they're the 4th pair of trotters i have bought in the past couple of years, they're a good brand i think."
These are the only shoes my daughter will wear.
wide sole stable boot
Arrived as described..
Great shoes. Love stride rite!!
"These World of Leggings Quilt Leggings are super soft and do not slip, twist or slide down. Yet there is plenty of stretch if I need it (weight fluctuation over the winter months).
I am 5'8"", 126 pounds and these leggings fit like they were custom made.
The colors are exactly as pictured; vibrant.
I am sincerely pleased with this purchase. A+++"
"Not a hat person but recently bought a new mini cooper convertible and needed to keep the sun off.  Have to say, this is a really cute hat and it's comfortable to wear!  It is a tad big, however, and I think my head is not particularly small.  But it does the trick when I'm driving on hot sunny days. Glad I found it here on Amazon."
Great shoes. Always a fabulous fit.
"These are exactly as you'd expect: High quality, because Vanity Fair is an excellent and reliable brand, and plain, high-waisted briefs, because that's what's shown in the picture. What they don't seem to be is ""cooling,"" whatever that means. They're definitely cooler than 100% cotton, which gets clammy and weird when damp, but not many of us wear 100% cotton undies any more. These are no different from other Vanity Fair briefs I've had -- that is to say they're comfortable, well-fitting, durable, and more practical than sexy. And, like most Vanity Fair briefs I've had, they have a decent, full, non-wedgie-inducing cut in the back. So overall, a very nice, comfortable full-coverage brief, but no more or less cool than other Vanity Fair briefs I've had."
"These are products I use regularly and am always looking for a ""good deal"" -- I feel this was a very good deal!  Quick delivery and completely satisfied!"
"Love these! So bright and colorful, fit great and didn't fall down at all during the day. The color is just so fun and stunning, I received tons of compliments. Well made.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
I like the cotton and like the colors offered. Good selection and well fitting sizes.
really very light and easy on a solid ground to maneuver  love the different color so can find my suitcase pretty fast.
"i love this shirt, i get compliments on it everytime i wear it."
They definitely feel like plastic not leather and aren't the best looking shoes I've ever owned but they're comfortable and what do you expect from $27 oxfords?
Very good looking shoe but more likely is a very comfortable running shoe quality so far very good. recommended for children who exercise a lot
"Love these. They fit great and don't sag during those hot, sweaty days. Five stars if a multipack was available or the price was lower."
"I ordered white, large. I am 5'6"" 127 lbs. Perfect fit. As another reviewer suggested, I removed the elastic at the waist. For me, it was not needed and are even more comfortable without it. There is lots of drape and puddling at the ankles and the band's are not tight. After I see how or if they shrink when I wash them I will order more colors. Great buy!!"
to big for my bracelet. but pretty
Very nice for protecting sunglasses
"REALLY nice sweat shirt!!!  Excellent quality and picture on sweatshirt looks exactly as on the Amazon web site.  The large runs normal and perfectly fit a young with long arms.  He is about 6'10"" and weighs about 130 lbs."
I wear a size 10 in pants and tried the large since I didn't want them to fit tight on my thighs. They were huge. I returned them and got the medium and it was perfect. Love how light the fabric is and the pockets are perfect for keeping my wallet and keys in at work.
i wore this to mickeys not so scary halloween party and it was a very hot and humid day. its not a hot costume very comfortable.  i ordered the extra large size (im normally a 12) and it fit me well. my only problem is the glitter. OMG the freaking glitter will get EVERYWHERE! it was in my armpits my face my kids hair was covered in it. that was my only problem with it. also the wig is a piece of junk so i bought my own wig.
"My daughter loved these and wore them all winter. They were great for winter and snow. My only problem is they were so bulky, but that is only my opinion."
"Shiny, pretty, translucent, purple chips make up this cute bracelet. Big enough to make a statement on its own or can be worn with others. I wish they would use a translucent stretchy string to make these, so it doesn't show as much through the stones, although that wouldn't keep me from buying this bracelet."
"Nice, but bigger than I wanted"
Christmas present for a Bieber fanatic!!
"It's roomy, but not in an oversized way. It's comfortable and soft and fit is pretty much as I expected."
Definitely recommend ordering a size up from your actual waist size. Arrived quickly as expected.
The shirt fit exactly as the size chart indicated and it arrived in the time stated. The shirt has a very nice bright vibrant color and has double Stitch scenes and a nice collar that stays even after several Washings. Very good quality shirt.
Bought these for a cruise and wore them the whole trip. They are a little flimsy but I expected that for the price. I would definitely order these again.
My son wore them until they were to small. The top and sides rubbed off a little but I expected that when he was crawling. You can't beat these shoes for the price.
"These boots are well made and many.... times I can fit into a youth boot.  These boots were to tall for me and the calf was to small.  I gave them to my grandson which fit him proprely and he could use them for outside chores to help feed and clean all their animals on their property.
I ended up buying Sloggers which are American made and fit me me very well.  The prices are about same."
"These rings are great.  I haven't lost any stones as of yet and have been wearing for over a week, washing dishes, bathing, typing, etc.  The shine is very nice and the fit is true to size.  I bought 2 to stack.  Highly recommend."
Nice everyday earrings.
"I am very pleased with the Traveltime Slip-On.  Easy to slip on, but no trouble keeping them on.  Very comfortable!"
nice looking and beautifully made.
"I love deals and this was a good one very in expensive and my son loves it, fit as expected and wasn't thin or scratchy material."
"Wonderful shoe, and coincidently vegan. I've been trail running with these for a few months and only have good things to say. I'll be buying another pair when these wear out."
Love them feel great..
I haven't used them yet but they feel nice and quality is good.
"K-Swiss never disappoints, always fit well, always comfortable to run/walk/jog/jump in. They go well with a lot of different styles, and gives you a solid, clean look. These are also easy to clean!

If you're like me that just hates those over the top flashy colors/prints, go K-Swiss."
My wife loved the fit and the comfort. She said that a are perfect for work. She is on her feet 8 hours a day in a retail store. She highly recommend this product.
Love the leggings. Color coral is more pink than orange pink as expected. But super comfy.
These were just what I needed for my baby! I love the colors and the  styles this pack had. Cute!
"i love them and my 2 year old loves them! Very comfortable, she can even put them her self.
the only reason i list 4 star is because her legs get so dirty in them (like she is walking barefoot)  so i actually use socks with them."
"I do not have words. I have almost a year with it. I'm a heavy guy. After a year is like brand new. Good, good, good s***!!!

2ND REVIEW: I have to write reviews but i have to accept it this wallet is for the army. This thing looks like the first day! High recommendation!!!!!!!!!"
"I was looking for a cycling cap and this was an expensive option to try one out.

Keep in mind it's very flimsy and made of a thin mesh. It's much thinner than what I've found in a cycling shop but I still love it. Keeps my head and helmet less sweaty and more comfortable during my rides. I have a huge head and it fit me perfectly.

A+ I recommend! Worth the low price."
"The suit is perfect it fits perfectly will definitely order again from Tuxgear, I liked the packaging and it got here in two days"
this wallet is stunning  it is everything I expected  the quality and workmanship is superb I love the slide out feature its different and unique  I like something that is different you don't have to go through the whole wallet to get your special cards which is nice I also like the color very nice highly recommend this  wallet as a  gift for  that special person or to gift yourself very PLEASED  !!!!
I absolutely loved this leotard! I'm a plus size girl (size 16) I wore it under a high waisted flowy skirt. Very sexy!
"NOW YOU WILL NOT MAKE MISTAKE IF YOU BUY THESE SHOES THEY FIT YOUR FEETS REAL WELL AND MAKE YOUR LEGS LOOK GOOD, I LOVE THEM."
"Length is good, but they are so well padded the toe is a little tight. They are comfortable for walking and I think they will loosen up. I haven't been able to test in the rain, cold or ice yet."
"It's a beautiful shade of brown. I have always ordered a size 11 and the Skechers fit fine but in this shoe it is a little bit large. However, since I will be wearing thick socks with the shoe, I decided not to return them for a smaller pair. Tried on with thick socks and shoe fits fine."
"Fits nicely overall, however I have a larger rib cage than normal so it was more snug in that area than expected. I decided to go with another dress that was more comfortable, but I would revisit this one in a larger size if I needed another dress."
Love these shoes!  Very stylish and comfy.  Perfect summer time sandal
this Warm Comfortable Slipper are my favorite thing to wear around the house. I might have to get a back up set just in case I loose a pair.
Omg super cute and soft! Love this little outfit..
I bought my usual shoe size (9) but they felt loose and allowed my feet to slide around. I returned the 9s and bought size 8 and they're much better. They have a nice firm sole that provides cushion for my heels (plantar fasciitis) on the tile floor in my house. I think they're going to be perfect.
"Works great so far. Elastic and strong but I don't think it will be strong enough to hold aggressive shoes like basketball, or running shoes. Great for everyday use, walking or work shoes (not construction, safety is an issue)"
"Great quality boots.  Very cute and comfortable to walk in with the soft sole, yet it's 3 inch heel, so that is very nice.  Versatile so that I wear the boots with pants/skirts and leggings.  Very nice fit.  American robustly made."
"Great looking tshirt at a GREAT price. I ordered a medium. I'm a size 14/38D ladies and the Medium fit me perfectly in a flattering body-conscious way. I prefer my tshirts to fit somewhat slim- not baggy, but definitely not skin-tight. The sleeves and collar are perfect. The collar is high and not oversized, and the sleeves hit exactly at the center of my bicep. The length is also perfect, long enough to tuck if needed but not so long I feel like I'm wearing a minidress. The fabric isn't too heavy but it doesn't feel cheap. The printing placement is quite flattering for anyone, male or female, who has a nice chest to show off. I can't wait to rock this at my next Hobie Cat event. Because you know, we're all adults most of the time, and who DOESN'T love a good fart joke?"
My favorite blouse from now on.
Fit fine and was what I needed for a party.
This hat is a great value for money. A nice cool hat for ths summer -- shades the head without holding the heat in. I would buy this had again.
"I bought these for my 9 year old son. He is raving about how comfy they are.
I also have a pair and love mine, as well :)"
"Just what I ordered, very comfortable"
Fun slippers and warm.  Am glad I saw them.
"I heard about these sandals from a friend and had to get some. They fit perfectly, true to size, and are so comfortable! The first time I wore them, I wore them all day at work (I am on my feet a lot) and they never once hurt. I would love to get a pair in every color!"
"Husband loves , very true to size and comfortable."
Wow. Bling is right.  Too much for me to wear and be believable but for anyone with manicured nails and stylish attire it is perfect and the size is right on.
"Awesome assortment of socks.
Saving for next Christmas. Great stocking stuffers.
Good quality."
The most comfortable and adorable slippers I've ever owned.  I don't know why it took me so long to invest in an UGG product.  My feet feel like they are in the clouds when I wear these AWESOME Slippers.  I LOVE THEM!!!
"Comfortable, pockets are sized good. Durable material and just the right length as in picture. When climbing a ladder, the cuff does not ""hang up"" on the knees."
Feel good fits right.
"The weather has gotten very cold all of a sudden, and my regular cotton socks aren't quite making the cut with my Chucks. Yeah I know I should use more substantial shoes in cold weather, but since I don't, these socks are great! I'm wearing a pair as I write this review, and my toes are very warm. Highly recommended!"
Love Keen Products. Can never go wrong with their shoes. Very comfortable and fit perfectly.
"Super, super shoe!! Barely had to break it in. Would totally buy it again "
I loved the dress! My daughter was the flower girl and looked beautiful. Everyone complemented on how pretty the dress looked! It was exactly as pictured. Also she wore an under skirt thing to make it look puffier. I plan on buying more of the exact dress for other occasions. I'm glad they offer different colors. We want them ALL! :)
"Great value, perfect.  Fit our adult son just fine.  Completed the Harry Potter costume."
I love Birkenstocks and have worn them for years.  I ordered a size 40 (9) as usual.  In the size 40 box was a size 36 so they were returned and of course there were no more size 40 left to purchase.
Very cool looking boots.
Bought these socks to wear with the spring/summer 2015 saddle/golf like shoes featured on the runway. They are a perfect lightweight sock for spring or summer. Well made.
Love my Jack Rogers and the price was unbelievable.
Perfect fit; very flattering to the figure.
"But it was!  I bought this and all the other pieces available from this company! Frederick's of Hollywood while its my favorite store their stuff just doesn't work well with my body so I was looking for something else this is it, its wonderful and I love it! I have an athletes body so I am not a twig but this not only looked good but it actually accentuated what I have and is very flattering my husband loves it and he hates this kind of stuff."
Love these! My feet are warm and dry when I slog through the rain to pick my son up from school. Definitely recommend !
"I'm an average height woman who is fairly trim and, fully extended, the straps on this ""kids'"" backpack makes it ideal for carrying my iPad (original model iPad 1).  If you have a thin silicone skin, it should be fine, too, but any thicker case such as a leather folio style will not fit.  I could also squeeze in my Targus bluetooth keyboard (model AKB32US), leaving the front outside pocket for housekeys, lipstick, etc.  Note, though, that there is no padding, so if you intend to use this for your iPad, carry it carefully.  It also would be the cutest little thing for children to carry a few small items and maybe a 5 x 7 book or two or possibly 8 x 10 (but no large textbooks).  The zipper allows for a fairly wide opening, making it easy to reach items inside the backpack."
"Love these, am obsessed and wear them all the time."
Great under armour quality.
Great classic chucks at a steal of a price. Cant beat it.
Very stylish. I get some soooo many compliments when I wear these. Comfortable and fit so cute!
Comfortable...like walking on a cloud
Thick material. Very warm
Love this brand.  Wear them all summer long and get many compliments.
"Nice coat, haven't gotten to wear it yet, since the temperature this fall have so far been warmer than usual. Only complaint about it would be the color is not as navy in appearance as I was hoping for, but that is okay..still very nice."
"Shoes fit great, keep my daughter steady and still look ""fancy"" with her fancy dresses."
Very warm.  Exactly what I expected.  Not so thick that you can't fit into your work boots or even your other shoes.  Not much more one can say about socks.
So adorable!  My daughter loves them and so reasonably priced.  Just precious!
I got the wine color....comfortable and so pretty!
"PLENTY long and wide in the leg. Maaayyybe could be a little bigger in the belly for guys like me, lol. But it's a lot more durable than I expected."
"I have really sensitive ears, but I've had these in for a couple months now with no issues. I love them! The size is a little large for me for everyday use, but that's my fault for not checking the size. They don't bother me, so I'm happy with them."
"Bought this to wear around the house and found it's soft enough to sleep in and much better to wear should a big, blue police box crash in my backyard during the night."
"This is a very comfortable bra from Lily of France- very feminine looking with the stretchy wide lace straps around your torso, and a pretty satin stripe design along the shoulder straps- very eye catching. The cups are soft and comfortable, and it's medium padded, with a light amount of lift. Bras are very individual, and my only minor criticism would be that the cups feel spread apart near the top a bit too much for my shape- i prefer less separation, more lift. The bra is extremely well made, however, and you should definitely give it a try if you like this style."
gift for grandchild
"Such a pretty sweater, made well and priced right!  My daughter loved it!"
"This arrived a little bit too large, but after one wash, shrunk to my correct size. I'd be a little worried if you receive this and it fits you well before you wash it."
"Very attractive and solidly constructed.  A little narrow toward the toes and might need a little more support and padding at the heels, but otherwise quite satisfactory.  These are probably the best reasonably price slipper of its type available."
Seriously one of the best fitting pant for babies.
Looks good! Fits good
I was searching Amazon for a bigger version of this shirt and came across this Big/Tall version of the Long Sleeve T-Shirt I own. We work in a unheated warehouse and needed something warm but comfortable. I was shocked by the good quality and I'm a big boy that usually wears an XXL but based on reviews decided to buy a XL which fits me great. This shirt is perfect for blue collar hard working men etc. Nice thick shirt that is roomy enough to move around and the best part is the length. I recently got this shirt for a co-worker who like how mine looked and wanted one. He is a big 370 pound guy that bought a XXXL and fits great. Highly Recommend!
"Great walking shoes.  Fit perfectly and are very lightweight.  I use them to walk my dog for about an hour a few times a week, and my feet and legs feel great when I get home."
LOVE this garment! excellent service!!
"Dainty, pretty earrings."
My nine-month-old baby hasn't made any complaints about the shoes when she wears them so I assume she likes them
Just as pictured.  Snapped easily onto my Pandora bracelet.  Great price.  Fast shipping.
"My husband wears a size 10.5 on his middle finger. I appreciate that the supplier lets you pick ring sizes by the half, because he's not exactly a 10 but not exactly an 11 either. It makes things a lot easier when there's an option in between. The ring fits, but needs some spit to get on. At least it never falls off! The ring is classy but doesn't cost a lot of money. My husband isn't sure if the inlay is actually wood, but he thinks it's pretty nonetheless. My husband loves wood inlay and even makes his own wood inlay rings occasionally, so he would know.

Attached are a few pictures of. It came slightly chipped on the inner rim. That part of the picture is circled in blue. We also aren't sure if the ring is totally round or slightly oval-shaped. The shape doesn't necessarily pose a problem, but I thought I should include that in the review.

The inlay is a gorgeous reddish brown; I wonder if it was stained. It is polished with some sort of resin, my husband wishes he knew what it was so that he could use it when he makes rings. Titanium is a quality metal and the ring has not scratched yet. My husband has had titanium rings before (but with no inlay) and they have held up pretty well. Overall, this is a good titanium wood inlay ring. However, there were a few imperfections so I'm giving it four stars.

Pretty hat for casual or fancy wear. Everyone likes it. Reasonable price and quick delivery. Very satisfied with this hat.
nice. sharp. better experience than mens warehouse!
"Such a gorgeous watch! Perfect weight, perfect size (ladies, if you like big watches that is), beautiful color, sophisticated and elegant design. Great style and goes with any outfit. Arrived in perfect condition. Nothing was broken or missing. I recommend buying this watch. Yes I had to have a few links removed (which I asked my dad to do, which seemed like an easy task for him anyway) because my wrist is small but overall it is a really great watch. I don't regret buying it. Ultimately satisfied with this purchase."
"Fits well, good quality"
"Adorable!  Surprisingly great quality for the price.  Fit is spot-on, not big in the waist at all as mentioned by some other reviewers, although I am more straight in the waist and hips.  For reference, I bought a size small, the tag listed it as UK8, US4.  I am 5'3 and 125lbs.  Perfect for a 1930's themed party- and I can easily wear it for other events."
Fits perfect.  I ordered a L/Xl which is my usual size.  Very soft and lightweight.  (Not warm for winterwear) I really like it.
"Bought a black Zenana v-neck t-shirt from a Marshall's several years ago and have been slowly wearing it to death. I was super excited to find that I could buy it in a 4-pack, and for a totally reasonable price. The cut is nice and long, it has a good amount of stretch to it and keeps its form beautifully over time, the material is the perfect balance between too heavy and totally see-through, and the neckline is low enough to be interesting without being TOO low. It's even nice enough to dress up for work, but still totally great with jeans and sneakers. Seriously, favorite shirt. :)"
"This is my second top of this style. Very comfortable. To prevent colour bleeding in the wash, I used cold water and vinegar. The bottom edge does have a few issues with unraveling, but I expected that after the first one. Still pretty, easily fixable, and a great buy."
Soo many compliments on theses boots!
Very good bag for the bike.
I work in yoga pants so I ruin them very easily.  You can not beat these for the price!  They fit great not to short. I would have given 5 stars but they stretch out rather quickly as you wear them.
"The Eagle Creek shoe bag is lightweight and feels pretty durable. The zipper opens and closes smoothly, and the bag just fits my size 10 running shoes. This is nicer than a plastic bag, which is what I normally use, but seems overpriced to me. Eagle Creek should probably also sell a larger bag for those with bigger shoes."
"These felt a bit small compared to my very first pair of Croc shoes, but am getting used to them. I do like the lining for wearing during the colder months. For whatever reason, when trying to put the strap behind, to hold the shoe on better, it seemed to make the interior of the shoe smaller,
and found the top of the shoe too tight."
The fit was little on the small size. But fit my 16 year old daughter very well. Fit more like a medium would fit.
"My son attends culinary school and has to have his uniform spotless for each class. In many cases, it ism cheaper for him to replace soiled aprons rather than wash them many times in the coin operated machines."
A tad smaller than expected but very pretty
"I liked the dress, it just didn't fit my body type well. The length was fine but the dress was so baggy and too loose on me, it wasn't flattering. The fabric was very light weight, would have been perfect for hot days. I ended up returning it."
"WE LOVE OUR TERRAMAR MENS THERMOLATOR CREW NECK LONG-SLEEVED TOPS, primarily for layering during cold winter months for added warmth and for under layers for wool clothing, but we also wear this item on its own for warmer weather, as it is mostly opaque in the black color and VERY comfortable and a little stretchy. We also appreciate that it is well made and durable, and very easily wash and drip dry or air fluff. We have ordered many of this item for ourselves and as giftables and we all seem to be very pleased with this top and have it on our list for future ordering, as we would like to have a couple more in our clothing pantry for handy availability. We find we can reliably order our regular sizes and have this item fit perfectly well. Thank you, Amazon. Blessings."
"These two necklaces will make a wonderful Christmas gift for my two Grand Daughters.
The Angel Fish necklaces are beautiful, and the girls will love them."
"Wow, I was going to say good quality but no...GREAT quality! This $20 dress surpassed my expectations. I'm very happy with this purchase! Also I noticed a lot of people on the reviews I read before I made the purchase indicated that it fits too small, I guess it depends on the person. I'm not a petite woman and it fits perfect."
"Nice. Does not change color in the shower, so that's a plus for me."
"This is super cute! The pads don't really stay in place but overall it's very comfortable. Would buy again. I'm a 34A, ordered a small, fits perfectly."
Dockers are always a good fit and comfortable.
"Just as described,  very well made"
"The wallet is really dark blue and very tight. I can't keep my checkbook and register in it. I liked my old one better.
Update: After posting my original 3 star review, I received an email from the company saying they were sorry I wasn't happy with th wallet and they are issuing me a full refund. I didn't have to return the wallet. That's why I have changed my review to 5 stars because That's amazing Customer Service. They really stand by their products. So if you are wavering about purchasing an item from them, DO IT! You won't be sorry. They will take care of you."
Great for the price. You'd pay triple in a bridal boutique.
"Love this dress! I bought 3 in other colors and with different arm lengths. Flattering through my whole pregnancy. The material is very soft, and washed up nicely in my washer and dryer."
"I'm absolutely in love with this top! So cute and fits like a glove and I love the laces around! Ordered one just to see, now I know it's perfect I'm going to order some more! "
Fit is a bit large in the thigh area.  Good quality.
It was large but thats a good thing because it will shrink a 1/2 size in the dryer...Great seller
"It took a while to break in this watch, but what new G.I. item comes ready-to-use. I love it for its simplicity and utility."
"They are kinda fitted , not for husky fellows"
Love the shirt but one of the sleeves is Stretched  Out at  the cuff
"Great, comfortable jeans that fit perfectly!"
Warm and comfy. Great pack to have.
"These boots are industrial-strength, professional grade work boots. The wide sizing fits well with thick winter socks. That's really fortunate because it's lining material is not all that soft and is very rigid. You can get a bit of chaffing or pinching if it's not a perfect fit. That's where the thick socks comes in, great cushions."
"I love them, they are long but this is what I was looking for."
"Really cute design for a great price. I get a lot of compliments on these. Can be paired with silver and gold tone items. In the first couple weeks the right shoe irritated the back of my ankle but once I broke them in, it was fine. The padding does absorb your sweat so you might want to wear those little skin-tone socks to make them last longer."
I sent these back as I ordered the right size in short and as I am small but not petite sized the crotch was too short and that bothered me but other wise these jeans are great quality and always look good. My mistake on this.
"Overall, excellent slipper. The shoe is too wide all around, which makes it fall off easily. My foot is too narrow."
"Perfect fit, smooth as described."
Perfect for my son who is multi-handicapped and can't tie shoes.  He loves the velcro closure.
"Nice item. The leather is very nice and the magnets are good and strong. An added plus is there is plenty of room for multiple forms of plastic, id, credit cards, insurance cards etc."
I really do love this top.  I received compliments when worn.  I wear a small to medium and I ordered the medium.  I bought it in black so see through was not a problem for me.  Not clingy and long enough to wear leggings with.  Slightly fitted at waist and flared a little around hips and thighs. Just right for me... 5ft. 115 lbs. Have one in black and taupe.
Love these little adidas outfits for my little guy! He looks super cute & seems to be super comfy. 5 stars!
This was a gift for my petite sister she loved it!!!
We are Dr. Who fans and absolutely love this item!!!  Bought it for my daughter and she doesn't take it off. Lol. It came on time and hasn't tarnished or turned her neck.green or anything.  Very Happy with this item.  Thank you!  :)
"These attractive open-filigree silver dome earrings are hollow so although they are a relatively large 1/2 inch in diameter, they are light in weight and comfortable to wear all day long. They are nicely finished with no rough edges.

The posts are a generous 1/2 inch in length, are securely attached and the post length should be a good fit for most ear lobes. These are a classic style that should not go in and out of fashion and they look good dressed-up and dressed-down. Small size metal earring backs are included along with a sturdy gift box."
It is so unique and beautiful in person!
"Only gave it 4 stars due to the heal height. The straight up answer is they  are definitely 3 1/2 heel height.( 3 3/4 with platform, which normally 1/4 is subtracted). Anyway, as stated great cute boot, seems comfortable. i don't like to go any higher than my standard 3 inch heel, but making an exception due to sale price i got so i will be keeping them. I did buy a 9.5, 1/2 size bigger than my usual too.....which is not like me, but my feet are on the wider side and i got a little worried based on some reviews and it worked out perfectly for me. I think the 9.5 fit like i would have expected my regular size 9 to fit,.so i was happy. its always tough to advise other people because we are all different fits, however i can vouch for them looking great with jeans and being a sharp looking boot"
"Helly Hasen: Roan Anorak;
Fantastic product! Helly Hasen makes excellent foul weather gear! Total protection.
This Anorak does not breath. If you expect that-you shouldnt buy this. Their jackets run one size small so order up. But if your spending time in foul raining weather-Then you cant go wrong with this jacket!
This seller explained the product well and shipping was excellent! I would definitely do business with this seller again. Highly recommend! Thank you."
"These are great boots. The leather is nice, good quality shoe. Comfy foot bed.  Its hard to say on the arch support because I need a lot. If you need moderate support, these would be great. They just didn't fit my foot. Slightly short for me, heel too wide (I have a very narrow heel). I returned them and didn't get a larger size because of the heel width.  I would have loved to have kept them.  Nice lining, nice zipper. A good boot I would have worn a lot. I highly recommend!  Alas, I have a very hard foot to fit."
"My second watch like this. Its pretty, but the stones eventually fall out. Still it works well."
Robe it a little too long for my height.
Very classy maxi dress!
i have been looking for a comfy bra for 42 years and this is finally it please do not stop making them i will DIE
My son loves these shoes and they seem to be holding up well after a couple months' wear. I'd definitely purchase these again without hesitation.
"I had never heard of this brand and with free returns and a great price I gave it a try.  It is a firm cork base, with a deep heel cup, and rigid sole.  It also has great arch support and adjustable straps.  I have a thicker ankle and was pleased there was ample strap. These remind me of a Naot in quality, and construction with perhaps even better support."
"Very good running shoe, it fullfill my expectations."
"Wonderful shoe, great delivery time frame."
"Fit's tight, but just as expected for a good rash guard.  Very happy with it."
"I love, love these shoes! These cute unicorn shoes would have been worn to a wedding with other unicorn accessories however...
They are too narrow :(

I have another pair of shoes made by cute to core, size 11 which fit. I have a little room at the tip of my toes but they are quite narrow in the tow area which squishes my toes when I stand.

If they fit like the other pair, I would have kept them. So sad but, these have to go back.

Hope this helped my bigger/wider foot ladies!"
"I love these keys! They are large, heavy, and perfect for decorating. My set did not get rust all over the place like some other people have mentioned.  I included this picture so you can see their size next to common household items."
My mom loved these slippers. Highly recommended.
So soft and warm!  Husbands first robe and he loves it.
love these shoes. I bought couple pairs with different colors to wear to the office.
"Wonderfully soft material with just enough stretch to be super comfortable.  With the wildfire season we have had, this shirt is a wonderful reminder.  I get comments every time I wear it."
Same excellent quality as my old Rolfs - it lasted over 20yrs.  Hope this does the same
Bought this for my daughter. Now I want one for myself. It's an awesome necklace!
It's best to get the next size up unless you like snug fitting shirts.
Ill be darned if these no show socks don't stay in place.  The first ever I have used that are so small and yet so reliable.  They have a very clever non slip pad on the back of the heal that keeps them nicely in place.  And they are comfortable.  So if you are looking for something that covers to the low back of your heal these are the real deal.  Of note don't get them expecting them to give any friction protection at the top back of the shoe - they are truly no show and don't reach that far up the heal.
Nice basic.
Nice and simple colour
Terrific socks . I am getting compliments on them in my yoga class. One drawback - they get tangled and twisted during washing in the washing machine.
"These are great! Very stylish for a pull-on pant. They fit snuggly, but not too tight.  Love the back pockets.  Thumbs up!"
"Excellent value for what appear to be a high quality blue jean.  Not a ""designer"" item by any metric, but if you want a sturdy, 4-pocket (who uses the change/watch pocket anyway?) blue jean, this is an excellent choice."
This purse is small and cute. Love it
The mask smells!!! Once you get over that however it is a decent mask. Mine arrived slightly deformed (typical for these kind of masks) but was easily fixed with a blow dryer and time.
"For the price, it's unbeatable!!! Lightweight, durable, well-made ... and it packs into its own pocket."
I love the Skechers Series of shoes. Good fit and they wear very well.
I am enjoying this product.
"Very responsive company to order from! Received this awesome shirt earlier than expected! Excellent quality! Not flimsy thin material, it's good quality and that is so appreciated, thank you!!"
"Gave these as a gift, my friend loved them.  Color has kept well and the socks are comfortable.  Not to mention they are absolutely adorable!"
"This review is for Ibagbar Men's Vintage Canvas Shoulder Everyday Bag (Moore Carden) - In Brown...

One of my dreams in life is for everything to have it's place. I am &uuml;ber organized. I need everything labeled and put away in its place. This bag makes that happen. It has so many compartments.
This bag has :
six zippered compartments
 8 credit card-ID-License slots
Keychain hook
pen/pencil holder
2 side pockets
A zippered mesh pocket
A grommet (eyelet; hole) for your headphones to come through
And many more features

I love how the credit card/wallet part of the bag is not only zippered, but also has the Velcro flap that goes over it. That makes me feel like my stuff is more secure. When I travel this bag will be great. I will be able to carry so many things in such a small space. The bag measures around about 10""x10"". The width varies depending how full the bag is, but it could be 6""+ down to 2"" when not carrying as much.

This bag is well made. It's made of heavy canvas fabric. The zippers are heavy duty, with leather pull tabs. The top of the bag has a handle that is covered with leather. The strap is really strong, wide and comfortable to wear. I wear mine crossbody.

Overall I am so happy with this bag. I was given the bag for free to test and review. I hope my review has helped you make your decision. My husband thought it would be a great camera bag."
"I just washed my husband's Dream Products slipper socks and they came out perfectly!  Cold, delicate cycle - aiir dry.  My husband loves these and actually wears them to bed on super cold nights!"
looks lovely it is equivalent to a 2ct tennis bracelet which is what I wanted. The only thing is the clasp is a little iffy so I end up tightening it manually with pliers every few wears. It's not that big of a deal but it is a little more maintenance than usual.
"The fit on this was a little big. My daughter wasn't a big fan of wearing it, but she looked adorable."
Ordered a Large... I needed an XL (so order up 1 size ladies) but its super cute and I get tons of compliments in it... looks nice on me on the back of our bike too! Company awesome to work with to exchange and rec'd item quickly! Good purchase at an awesome price!!
The message is what I liked the most
very cute perfect one time occasion dress
"These boots are very sexy and comfortable. I have bigger calves for regular boots but not big enough for wide calf boots so I either have to wear them big or the boots have to be able to scrunch a bit. These already have a little scrunch naturally so they work perfectly. I got lots of compliments on them and a girl in my office made me take them off so she could try them on. They zipped up perfectly for her. I had to get size 8 because 7.5 wasn't available but they still felt comfortable. I'm pretty sure they are true to size. I'm a true 7.5 in every shoe. One thing to note, however, is the color is a deeper red than the picture. It's more of a wine red."
My husbands new favorite shoes! Excellent arch support
"Decent bag, works well, but looks a little cheap in-person. I'm not going to return it but I regret buying. Review update:  after submitting my mediocre product review, I was contacted by their customer service. They made a very successful attempt at creating a satisfied customer.  I want to complement them for their focus on customer service. I will be buying from them again"
Love it. Will buy in different cohorts. It does fit perfect to size. Was delivered quick too. Like them better than other Glydes with thicker platform.
"Very nice, really slouchy, no problem I recomend it it is pretty warm. No good for small heads good for avarage"
"135, 5'4"" and I wear a size 8 normally. I ordered the 9 and it was perfect fit for me. I don't like the three buttons because they go high & I muffin top so if you aren't sporting that look- you should be good to go. I wear it with a flowy shirt to hide my ghetto-ness."
"Yes.

Space socks.

Space....

On your feet.

Forget walking on air.

You are walking in a vacuum. Not really.

Space socks!"
Great dress for the price! Looking forward to wearing this to work in the spring
"Nice heavy looking ring, i know people are looking at this ring becasue one guy stop me and told he ,he too was a Mason, and he love the way the ring looked"
Mostly walk indoors as the sole is not rubber.. Great quality-warm product. Watch for that elastic on the back of your baby ankles so doenst get too tight on his ankle possible stopping the circulation..
This one requires a short learning curve to get your eyes to adjust to reading the time. But when you do it is actually a fun watch.
I wear this bracelet almost every day. I think it's incredibly stylish and my family immediately noticed it when I went home to see them recently. Its great for such a cheap price but I do wish it was a bit more sturdy. I worry that someday I'm going to end up accidentally breaking it by over-extending the elastic.
Cant see sideways while wearing. Not good for riding bikes.
Wozzzzzs good good good
Absolutely love this kimono.  Looks wonderful with jeans or a fancy black dress!  Great addition to any wardrobe for any occasion!  Thanks amazon!
"This slightly shiny (water resistant- wipe it down with cleaning wipes), extremely durable work bag is amazing.  It fits several standard size binders in the central pocket, as well as a large front pocket that keeps steno pads, and three small front pockets that hold everything you can imagine, and two large side pockets that will each hold a 20 oz water bottle.  Would be great for home health care or a nursing student- or anyone who trucks a bunch of gear to work every day.
Edit_
i have been using this every work day for two years now, and the shoulder strap (metal claps) finally broke on one side.  no rips, tears or wear through on the base of the bag.  some of the fabric looks used (it's a two year old bag!  Absolutely worth the value, and i'm off to the store to get new clasps.  this workhorse bag has far exceeded my expectations."
"I got for this watch for thanksgiving, almost waited for a week to arrive.

A very elegant and good looking watch. I especially love the black dial.
It is well constructed with quality materials and workmanship. I use it as an everyday watch and love it.
Water resisitant, but don't wear it while having a bath or doing the dishes.
The dual LED acts a flash-light in dark places and to find things inside a car while in motion.

I am glad I got this watch at Amazon, instead of searching it in a store.

There have been several complaints about the strap etc. The fact being that the
strap is good and very comfortable. It is made out of hard rubber and feels soft and sturdy.
This is the best watch I ever owned in years.

Well worth my dollars."
"I think I ordered the wrong size. For the price, they are made well and I plan to order a size smaller."
Bought as a gift for my son & it's exactly as shown/described.  Nice quality!
Looks very nice and warm
Beautiful dress! I might want to do some crunches before I wear it because it fits like a glove. It is well made with a nice thickness to the material.
"Had this thing on my desk since I bought it and it holds an HTC One M7, wallet, knife, pen, and keys. The only drawback is that as phones get bigger and bigger, I know that the next phone I have won't fit so nicely."
These are thin and will allow my to work at my computer.  I like that they are not too long so I don't have to worry about what to wear to work if I want to use these at the office.
"These jeans fit as expected but do stretch out about one full size after wearing a full day.  I would have liked to have bought a size 6 instead of a size 8 but they run a little short in leg length.  (I tried on a pair size 6 in a store - fit better but leg length was too short)  I am 5""5"" but need a 30"" inseam.  Size 8 is a 29"" inseam.  These ""Skinny"" legs are not too tight either if you tend to have bigger legs. I don't believe they shrunk in leg length in the dryer...they do not require any ironing if removed immediately from the dryer. The fabric is soft, beautiful & comfortable.  I now have 6 pairs in assorted colors."
Nice leggings to wear under long tunics.
"Exactly what I ordered. I was very pleased with this ring and the other. I bought both the man and womans. I received my rings long before the dates given. No issues whatsoever.

Ordering more items from this company right now."
Great shoes and very warm/comfortable
"It doesnt have much stretch around the waist.  Im a 14, and it fits a little tight but it does fit."
These are stylish and comfy. They make me WANT to workout. Such a great purchase . True to size. Love the pink and gray so sexy!
Best shapewear in the market if you are looking for comfort with mild to moderate support. It is also true to size.
"Super comfy, no problem with the fit for my 17.5 inch circumference calves. I'm 5'3"" and these go up to the knee. I plan to get more in fun patterns."
"Needed to buy a bigger size, stated size was not fitting,  shoe was narrow on feet was tight but I loved it"
"great deal, lovely necklace, unbelievable price, well made for the cost!! I purchased several items as gifts for my Titanic Murder Mystery party, this did not disappoint. Thanks!!"
Good price for a decent belt. The only issue I had was figuring out how to get the latch to release so you can take the belt off. FYI make sure you know how it works before you have to make a rush restroom call. It is easy once you figure it out but there are no instructions on where the release latch is or how it works.
"*sigh*  Warning: do not trust the reviews here complaining about the shorts being too small.  I bought a size 34 instead of my usual 32, and I really regret it.  The shorts really do fit like a 34 which is too large for me.  Guess I have to chalk this up to either manufacturer inconsistency or bad user reviews.  Either way, it's a shame I have to return these even though they're perfectly good shorts. I bought 3 pairs!  The colors and the fabric were both nice.  Can't say anything about durability obviously."
I LOVE Freya and this bra is probably my favorite. The J-hook is a major bonus to a great bra!
"Robeez shoes are expensive, but great for small kids to wear around the house - they seem comfortable and have good grip, but once the kid gets old enough to walk by themselves outside, at that point we just used tennis shoes outside and bare feet or socks inside, since they could then walk in socks on the slick floors inside without trouble."
It is a good costume but the head section is a little snug.
i love carhartt clothes and buy them without a worry if they are worth the money because so far they've always been great. just look for deals if you can...... good stuff is expensive.
"This is an excellent bag which looks a bit overwhelming when it's flat and empty.  I had initially ordered the Citrine, which is a beautiful, true lime green that doesn't tip over into neon, but then decided the Sky Blue looked better because it matches my car :-)  Anyway, the snaps on the top are nice to get it fully open, and the bag seems quite sturdy.  I did get it on sale, and the only reason I took off a star is because it would be nice if the short handles were on rings so they'd flap down when it's being carried crossbody.  But I can live with it.  A version on wheels (sturdier than the current VB travel duffels on wheels) would be good, too."
These leggings areverry comfortabl and great price well made
I love these sandals.  I am wearing them right now.  Comfortable to the extreme.
"Good for the price, definitely not super high quality. Would order again for the price.

They are thin, but fit just the way I like them to. Not SUPER low cut, but still low cut covering the back of my heal."
"I normally wear a medium, but ordered a large because I like extra room for layering. This hoodie is light weight, perfect for layering or when you don't need a heavy sweatshirt."
Product is very well made and definitely keeps your pants up. The straps a heavy duty.
Terrific bargain.  Our daughter loves this and wears it frequently.
"Perfect length, doesn't ride up, doesn't cling."
My grandson loves them!!!  3rd pair we have purchased.
This is super cute and true to its size.
"This ring is oddly light for being tungsten... but i suppose it's not solid tungsten. this is actually a good thing especially for people who have never worn a full tungsten ring before.

My girlfriend bought me this ring the other day and I was pleasantly surprised by this ring. it's light and fits nicely. the edges are all nicely rounded and smooth, I cannot state how important this is for a ring made out of tungsten. it has no give, no flex. you want a smooth edge in case your finger swells for any reason. Without it you will likely have to shatter the ring to get it off.

Don't listen to people who say tungsten is unbreakable and if something happens they can't get it off your finger. it's a lie, all you have to do is take some vice grips to it and the ring will shatter. But with this said due to the fact that it doesn't flex or deform degloving is a real possibility. keep this in mind if you work with your hands.

The ring itself is actually quite attractive, the blue is a nice without making it feminine and the little metal lines through it catch the light just enough to be noticeable.

I received this item at a discount in return for an honest review"
"We purchased this robe for our son.
It's very soft and well made.
He really likes it.
Material has a good weight to it.
Good price for the quality of the robe."
"As I had read that the dress fits small, I ordered a XXL instead of an XL for safe measures. However, the dress was still too small, especially in the upper half of the dress. Luckily, I have been losing weight and working out and feel that in 10 more pounds, it should fit perfect. I love the color  and the material. It's a very lite weight fabric, which will make it great to wear in the summer. I plan on packing it for my honeymoon in June. My fiance loved the dress as well, and he typically isn't a fan of the 50's style that I love. It makes me think of an ""I Love Lucy"" dress, which I am a huge fan of. I think the dress could be worn in a variety of places. I'm a teacher and would totally wear it to work, I'd love to wear it to church, out to eat with my fiance, to the theater, or possibly to the grocery store I love it so much. I will definitely will be purchasing more like this!
I truly love this dress, despite it being too small to wear right now.
I received this product at a discounted price, in exchange for my honest opinion review."
excellent^^
"I like these shows very much. There is a bit of a let's get acquainted period tho. You need to position your foot in the shoes correctly and then tighten straps to fit, making sure your foot is in the exact position it needs to be. I kept getting my foot back too far and then with a few adjustments, it seems to fit right. I really need a 10 1/2 not 11 tho."
Got it for my toddlwr to take to play school. It is sort of big for my 2 plus year old toddler. But she loves dragging it. And it is very light. It is a good buy! Good quality too
"It looks exactly like the one in the picture on Amazon. Gorgeous!! Super material of heavy cotton with a little stretch. and fully lined. Looks like a $200 DRESS! I'm 5'6"" and 112 lbs, very slender build and a S fits me perfectly. I'm glad I didn't go for a medium. I'm 32B in bra size and the dress fits snug around my chest, but I'm also wearing a padded bra underneath..It's kind of loose in the waist, but the beautiful belt that came with the dress took care of cinching the dress just right. The arm holes are a bit small, but my spaghetti arms fits them well. If you are on the heavy side bosom wise the dress in size S might be a bit tight. I have to order a whole bunch more of these beauties, especially the floral red and pink one. Shipping was about 8 days."
2nd pair and they are the best shoes yet. Plantar fasceitus is a problem and these are perfect.
Very pretty but way to small
"Stunning earrings, timeless and classic. Can be dressed up or down. I agree with another reviewer, these do look a lot more expensive than they are. Purchased as a birthday gift for my sister; hopefully she will love them! Sidenote: these look just the same as pictured. The blue topaz is fairly light, similar to blue diamond hue. Very pretty ear sparklers. The earwires/leverbacks appear to be sturdy and well made."
"Recently I was wandering around my favorite Montenegran casino and I bumped into noted author/auteur Biff Rafferty, just returning from the Scandinavian art lecture circuit. He gave my evening attire the quick once over and announced I was too bland. Too Continental. What I needed was the flash and glow of blue paisley! Once again, Biff was right. The color also tends to highlight my blue eyes and straight cut bangs."
"Love them fit well and walk comfortable, bit pricey"
"Love these, everything great"
Fits as expected- nice feel and overall look
Good price for a very good boot!
"Just as pictured, with sleeves on the shorter side of ""long"" but it fits as expected and is true to size.  I am a US M.  I ordered that size and had no issues."
"Nice pattern and fit.  My husband is a 34"" waist, and the medium fit perfect."
It really keeps u warm...
"These socks are so comfortable, and they maintain their color so well! I wear them all the time, and I will defiantly be buying these again!"
"Lovely, well made and I don't feel like an old lady dressing like a teenager. ."
"Can't go wrong with NorthFace - This jacket is perfect soft, furry, warm.  Fit great - ordered larger size for layering.  Love it."
"Beautiful!!!

It fits true size... well made and excellent quality as usual in frye shoes; i really love them... thanks amazon!!!"
"Very nice, fit well and provide enough coverage."
"This is a very nice dress. However, pay attention to the size chart because it fits like a large to xlarge.. My chest measurements are about 41 inches which and my waist about a 34 and I am 5 feet 4 inches. The dress fits like a Midi on me which is not a problem since I love to wear heels. The dress looks great for the price. I will be wearing it to a themed birthday party that is formal. The dress has a lot of stretch. I usually wear a size 12 in dresses and this dress has a lot of room"
I really like these but they were way too long for me. I have a short neck and these just laid on my shoulders....I gave them to my daughter..They fit her better....
I am 5'7 and 140 pounds and this dress looks and feels perfect.  Lightweight fabric for those hot days in summer.
Nice light weight robe. Color was suppose to be a teal color seems to be more of a lime green. Not a bad color but its not what I consider a teal. Could be a little softer.
"Very comfortable, easy to slip on. look stylish to me. Will order another pair in another color."
Ordered my normal size and it seems to run a little large. They were darker than the picture shows. Incredibly comfortable and perfect for my wide feet.
"I bought a size up just in case. Should have bought my regular size, this one is a bit big. Costume seems true to size. Love the sparkly fabric. The head peace is horrible, but I was not planning on using it anyways."
First time in J.B Socks and i love them. Have been looking for a warm winter thick sock and these are exactly what i was looking for.
"Am I the only person who has never seen a shirt like this?  Its incredible!  The inside of the sleeves are lined and quilted.  The rest of the inside is lined with what I can only call faux lambs wool.  If youve ever seen the lambs wool car mitt. . . or lambs wool throw for babies.. . thats kind of what its like, though its polyester.  If you look at the color of the picture of the shirt, and zoom in, you can see a little of it.  Its VERY comfortable.  Makes it nice so you can go out when the weather is cool, and not have to wear a jacket.  Depending upon where you're going you might want to layer and wear another s*** underneath, just in case you get too hot and need to pull this one off.

Ive washed it, and it did very well.  No problems there.

At the current price, if this were just any other flannel shirt, I would think its a bit expensive. . . but because its lined throughout, I think its quite affordable."
I have two other pairs in a different style so I knew to buy a half size smaller than usual. I usually wear a 7.5..bought a 7 and was surprised to find they were still too long..kept slipping off my heel. I intended to return them but I purchased them on the last day of a 20% off sale and was going to lose my 20% off ..so I purchased a pkg of 2pr of heel protectors for less than $3..put 1 pair in my new shoes and they fit perfectly..these are my favorite shoes right now
"A bit too large in the waist, but leg width is good"
Nice boot at excellent price.  Like the all leather with leather sole and rubber heel.  Bought in same size as my normal shoe size and fit perfectly.  Have owned much more expensive boots over the years but the quality of this boot seems equal to those higher cost boots.  For those wanting a working cowboy boot for riding or general wear can recommend this product.  Did have to order this one vs the darker cherry as my initial order was cancelled as not in stock.  Reorder came very promptly.
"I love these sneakers for the price they are very comfortable,stylish, and durable."
Can't wait to use it.  So nice and roomy!!!  Judy.  Love Vera Bradley purses.
"I received this at a discount in exchange for my honest review. This womens jumpsuit fit perfectly, I Ordered the medium and the sizing chart was exact.  It fits comfortable, is very sexy.  The belt that it has is well made, does not look cheap.  The entire back is open for a full sexy look with a string of triangle metal designs.  The arms are slit from the shoulders to the wrists.  Perfect for a night out."
Arrived ontime & fit 8-9yr old boys perfect
"I got this for my boyfriend for hunting season and he loves it! It's super warm and it's big enough to fit his relatively large head. The adjustable straps are nice to make it fit perfectly. It's soooo soft and it's good that it's camouflage too, makes it convenient so he doesn't have to paint his face for hunting anymore."
"I was really impressed with this set. I don't know anything about watch repair, so i can't speak to the quality of  the tools but they seem really nice to me. Buying the set was cheaper than paying to have two watches resized. The set worked perfect for what I wanted it for."
"I mean, really? What is there NOT to love? Look at the picture. That's just freaking awesome. Nice quality shirt, and I laugh my arse off every time I wear it."
"this is a nice looking, solid watch for an amazing price.  obviously it is not the same level of quality as the rolex that it resembles but it is definitely better than its price would suggest. it has a swiss ronda gmt mov. that works well and it is comfortable and has a good weight to it.  the dial and bezel look great as does the steel band but it does have a stamped sheet metal clasp which is a standard design in the industry for mid level watches. it has a secure fit and should last a while, I have had watches like this for many years and have not had any problems. someone I know bought an orient watch for about 200 dollars that is made with the same type of steel band and clasp, and his watch does not look as good as this soco.  some people do not like homage/tribute watches but if you are considering buying one this watch is a great deal.  when people comment on my nice rolex I tell them the truth, that it is a super, worry free active wear piece of affordable man jewelry. however no one will be able to tell the dfference unless they grab your wrist and take a close look"
Great size for what you need to take when boarding and off boarding
"I've needed a carry-on piece of luggage for years as a regular business traveler. I'm really impressed with the quality you can get this at the price point. This suitcase is light, strong, and can really hold a lot. I expect this suitcase to last for many years of business travel."
"Really nice pair of sunglasses.  Look great, comfortable to wear and the polarized lenses are crystal clear.  These seem like a much more expensive pair of sunglasses, great value."
"However, I must have been in a hurry because I ordered the wrong size. My bad! The swim shoes looked like a top quality product, so I was sorry to have to return them. But it was a cinch with Amazon! Unfortunately, t the swim shoes were no longer available with Amazon Prime. So I ended up ordering a similar swim shoe from a different company in order to get free shipping. Too bad! I hope the pair I ordered are as nice as yours!"
The color is awesome! So vibrant and Springy. Fits typically. Love the cuffed sleeve option.
Better than expected!!!!!
Have worn these for about two weeks now and I can say one of the most comfortable pairs of shoes I have ever owned. I am really enjoying them. Seem to fit true to size.
I normally wear a size 9 and these are 8 1/2-9 so they are a little on the small side.  This is the second pair that I have ordered because I LOVE them!  Great for summer...they do stretch out a bit.  I would definitely order them again.  They are great for summer....and great for rainy days....
I really like this camisole! The length is great but it still runs a little big. BUt overall is wonderful.
"I love this dress. The previous reviews were pretty accurate concerning where the too of the dress fell. It falls right below the breast. If your build is slim, the dress may fall at the waist. The dress is beautiful and can be dressed up or down."
Beautiful ring set. The finish is gorgeous and I love it. Looks great on my hand and everyone thinks it's real and comments on how beautiful it is!
Love these. So very cute. Bought these for Easter gifts for my 3 granddaughters & just ordered another one for my neice. Perfect size for a child under 12.
Great jeans I love Levis. Fit great.
It's probably one of the best pair of shoes I've ever had. Highly recommended..
"Purchased this as a gift for my husband, he loved it! The print is fantastic, and the fit was perfect. I'll definitely look into the other prints offered by Out of Print Clothing in the future. :)"
"These classic earrings have impressively large cubic zirconia in a gallery crown setting with beading at the base and open latticework sides with finials.  The stones have a diameter of about 5/16 in. and are very brilliant.  They will attract both light and attention.

The settings are plated in 18k gold.  I have the white gold and it is convincing.

The 7/16 in. posts have standard backs that fit tightly.

The earrings are delivered in a flocked hinged presentation box ready for gift-wrapping.

Orrous & Co. provided earrings for evaluation and review."
These fit perfectly  and they look nice.  I don't use them as scrubs  but as everyday pants even to appointments.  I call these  my U{SS pants because it sure comes close to the brown they war.  I would love it if navy or black is available.
"Muy buen zapato, hemos comprado algunos modelos, es muy liviano, prctico, sencillo, verstil, hay en todos los colores y variedades, para todos los gustos."
Really cute shirt.  Very colorful and generous fit.
Very easy to use and comfortable. My wife prefers this to hands free bras which are very expensive.
"Material and size is good, will be keeping it"
Very stylish and worked out great for my climb up Dunns River Falls in Jamaica. Only con was that the holes were a bit large and it allowed very small rocks to come through. If you won't be near rocks I would say these would work perfectly.
Not sure why people buy expensive shoes when you can get the right look at a good price.  They look great and will fit in anywhere.
I love the fact that they are adjustable for my feet whether wearing socks or barefoot.  Great Product and in my Size 16 !!!
"The uniform looked so cute on her. Fit just right. Like the material, it's not heavy. Holds up good in washing. French toast are my favorite uniforms . bu"
Very Nice Hat - I would like it if the vents were a little more air allowed through.  My Dad loves it!
super comfortable. and love the look.
We live in California so it doesn't rain that much. But so far this umbrella has worked out just fine. My son loves it!
My husband likes them they run a little narrow on the top .Took a few days for it to stretch out.
"very comfortable, good stretching, definitely get more"
"These have a different color in person. I have the graphite, which looks more like a faded black.
Still look really good and fit well. I will be purchasing couple of other colors."
Great mittens for keeping little hands warm and dry!!
"I like KY Liquidbeads. It is a good lubricant, and works well."
Very good socks comfortable.
"Pretty solid, good looking robe.  The colors and quality have made a few people ask if it's Polo.  That's a pretty good confusion to have if you ask me."
"I'm very overweight so needed wide shoes and these fit the bill.  I'm sure most normal-sized folks could wear this shoe all day -- it's very
comfortable and has lots of arch support.  I was very happy to find these fit my wider than normal feet!!!"
First booties we found that would stay on the baby's feet!
"I love these earrings. I'm sensitive to fake jewelry and I needed a decent size set of earrings that wouldn't over power my small ears. These look great, the way the light hits them to make them sparkle is romantic. I highly advise getting these!! If only there was an option for insurance so we could get a replacement. I just got these for the second time because I lost one. But I guess NOW I have a backup!"
"I was looking for a watch to wear after I hurt my wrist.  I decided since I couldn't wear a wrist watch I wanted to still have a watch, and found this pocket style watch on a chain.  It is very nice to look at and I while is a smaller face I can still read the time very well.  The chain is a longer chain and I suppose could be placed on a shorter chain, but for me it's a perfect length."
I love these Dudes!
Actually love this wrap for my post csection support. I would give it 5 stars if it was longer.
"when i saw this dress, i fell in love with it, and i linked it to my friend who showed it to her daughter, and she loved it too (the dress was for her) it was one of the few cute ones i found that carried her side and so happy that it worked out because there were only two sizes left, and no time to switch.  Dress fit as expected. she's 7 and wears 10 in clothes but 8 in dresses and it was perfect.  i found some adorable jewelry on amazon that matched this as well, gold with that teal color rhinestones, and it was so pretty together.  I paired this with small gold huggy hoops, a gold leaf hair band, a gold locket and a bracelet with the matching rhinestones. all bought from amazon prime. heres the pic of the combo i put together for her, minus a little black shrug in case she got cold."
Bought these for my son and he absolutely loved the light green color and fit.  I originally bought a size that should have fit according to the sizing chart but I had to exchange as they ran a little small.  They cam just above the knee and were slimming.  They dried quickly after swimming.  Totally recommend.
"Just got back from using them, worked very well and the color works because you can see them in baggage clam real easy."
"I just love these sandals, I have problems with my heals and I was told by a friends to try them. I have a few pair know. I purchase this pair and they seem to fit just a little big but I will use them anyways."
"My husband wears flip flops all year round, and wears them out quickly. So I decided to find him something more durable for Christmas, and he loves these !  Even in the house with his pajama pants on, he is wearing these sandals as I type this. Very comfy says my husband. So glad I bought these."
"great fit, great color.  I am a senior and this tunic flatters my rotund figure.  Happy with the purchase"
"The sterling Silver wheat chain description was GREAT! I wear it every day and have no problems with color change,perfect weight."
"I'm 5'4"" and 125 lbs. This fits amazingly well. It's clingy but not too tight, if you know what I mean, and it doesn't ride up at all, which is great. My only sadness is that I snagged it a little on the first wearing. The fabric is not the very highest of quality; you can tell the stripes are just printed on top, but it'll do fine if you don't snag it. I might just order another one, I like it that much."
"I got this watch for my 8-year-old daughter and she's very happy with it. It's cute and comfortable, with a soft silicone band that's very flexible. It's large for a kid-- in fact, larger than the watch I wear-- but that's necessary because there's a lot going on on the watch face.

The reason it lost a star for me was that I found the programming and instructions odd and non-intuitive. I pressed one wrong button when setting the time and then had to struggle for 20 minutes to figure out how to unset the alarm I'd accidentally just set (I didn't see which graphic I was supposed to ""un-highlight"") and get the time set correctly. Important: Don't lose the instructions!

I also wish there were a way to turn off the seconds display, because I think it's distracting for a kid who's in any situation that requires concentration-- like school. When numbers are constantly changing on their wrist, kids are going to be prone to glancing down when they should be paying attention.

Other than that, it seems to be a well-made watch with a nice design, especially for those who aren't particularly into character-based stuff. It's also nice that it has a built-in alarm and stopwatch function, which is rare in kids' watches.

I received this for review."
"I am a huge fantasy/steampunk/fairy fan. I am a bit of a nerd (OK. A lot) and I love my sci-fi shows and some cosplay. I have a need for this necklace so I was quite excited to receive it. The nice thing for me is it's as cool looking in the day as it is in the night because it's a little bottle of dust so whether it's glowing or not the idea is still very much the same.

My necklace came in a cute box for gifting, I like this presentation. Each link on the chain is secured in place and nothing was broken or missing. The little bottle of dust is tightly closed so I don't have any dust falling out and the length is good for me too. It glows a pretty shade of blue in the dark after you charge it in the light, I find sunlight works great since I do not own a black light.

Overall, well made, no missing links, the clasp is perfect, the length is good for me, and it's whimsical fun either in the dark or the light. I really love it, the little cork bottle is sealed well too.
I have nothing negative to add at this time.
I received this product as a complimentary sample in exchange of my honest and unbiased review. I was not paid for this review, this is exactly the way I feel about this item after using it."
"I've used these in average hikes, paved jogs, trail running, biking and elliptical. Sometimes it hurts the bottom of my feet on elliptical and while walking. But it has excellent traction and I've never had an issue with it while running. I'll buy them again."
"NICE TANK. ALTHOUGH IT STATED ""MENS"" I LOVED THE NEON PINK COLOR. AS I SUSPECTED THE ARM HOLES ARE WAY TO LARGE AND REQUIRE SOME TAKING IN WITH NEEDLE AND THREAD. I COULD WEAR A CAMI BUT IT WOULD BE TO HOT. TOOK 8 DAYS TO ARRIVE IN PLASTIC ENVELOPE.  THE FEEL OF THE TANK IS SUPER SOFT. THE THICKNESS IS OF MEDIUM WEIGHT. I AM 5'10 165lbs SO I GOT THE XL FOR ADDED ROOM AND THE LENGTH COVERS MY BUTT! I DO RECOMMEND."
Really like this purse!
"Send back some crappy Levi's belts for this.  Nice quality belt.  Bought 2"" up from waist size and they're perfect.  (It was two gifts.)  Look great with jeans--sexy even.

Update:  Two years later and still going strong, albeit not with daily use exactly.  Came to get one as a gift now."
"Almost two years since I bought the earrings, and I am still liking it much. It still shiny. The craftsmanship is uber. Two thumbs up."
great watch; it handles all my due dates and excellent military time
Great price! Great shirt!!
Love at first site! I wore them without washing....yuk I know but they feel so good. I have washed them twice since and them are still yummy. I hope they hold up. I plan to buy other colors. They have not balled up inside which is my fear over time. Time will tell.
"These are really beautiful.  I'd ordered other CZ studs to replace a pair of real diamond studs I foolishly lost.  Sent them all back because they looked fake; one irritated my ears and were beginning to turn them green!  These are sparkly and look real.  Also, very comfy because of the gold plating.  Have slept in them for a few nights and no problems. The only reason I can't give them 5 stars is because the backs slide down the posts VERY easily and could easily come off."
oh yeah..these are great!
"Great shows, but way too big. If you buy these go at least 1/2 (if not a full) size down from what you normally wear. (My teen wore them to the river, then informed me that they were too big so we're stuck with them. Kids!)"
Versatile
AAAAA ++++++
"I love, love love this vest!!! I have been looking for a sweatshirt quality vest for years. Heavy weight material and super warm. It doesn't collect dog hair like fleece does. I am going to get another one when they come out with more colors. I bought an xl and can wear it with a hooded sweatshirt under it, and I am usually a 14-16 and larger chest."
"A gift for my handsome husband,  and it fit perfect."
"I bought this watch from Jomashop and am very happy with it. The watch feels very substantial as does the band, and it's quite accurate. The dimensions are not correct however. Thickness of the watch is listed as 8mm. It's more like 12mm which is still very thin for an automatic watch."
The pearls are beautiful. I plan to give them as a wedding present to my future daughter-in-law and I know she will love them. Thank you for a wonderful product.
I bought this corset for a steampunk costume and it is perfect. The quality and fit are good and the price was fantastic :)
great shoe but got a med instead of a wide width- my fault
"comfortable. flexible. attractive. I love the color, its a great grey color with a touch of light green."
What can I say...they are Dockers.....bought them for years....always good quality and fit
Hubby loved this wallet!
"This is my daughters second pair of ASICS. We learned with the first pair to go a size up and they fit her feet perfectly. My daughter loves to run and is a super active kid and these sneakers can keep up and hold up. Theyre more expensive than some other popular kids brands, but to us its worth it to support her growing feet with good, long lasting shoes."
"I love these rain boots and walk in the woods for hours in comfort.  Great traction, too. I would give them a ten star rating if not for the fact that they are NOT RED.  They are PINK."
Pretty but a little bit heavy!
comfortable and easy on the feet.work all day and feet feel great in them. a bit roomy in the toe part but still good
"Comfy, true to size and stylish! I love these with jeans"
Perfect shapeware to slim you all over
"exactly as described - comfortable, non-wrinkle, and just what was needed"
"very satisfied! I'm 5'7"" 140 lbs and I ordered a medium. I think it fits perfect for my body. The top has that cut where upper side boob is showing but I like the style. The bottoms have great coverage. The fabric is quality. Love it!"
"Very comfortable material.  Nice length.  Fits true to size - not tight, but not big and boxy.  I plan to buy more!"
Best purchase ever. I'm getting too many compliments after the first day.
"Perfect for my 8 month old baby. I order size 6-12, 4.5inch. I do recommend them.  They stay on!!"
"Very pleased with this bag.  I have been using it for 3 weeks straight now, carting around office supplies and other items as I have recently started a new job and had to set up a new office.  Very comfortable, easy to get into.

Only items holding my back from a five star rating are:
-The area for holding the drink is very tight.  I can barely fit my coffee mug (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EV4UTUW/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_15) in it.  Anything bigger is a no go.
-I wish there was a small pocket on the outside of the top flap for slipping in commonly used items to make the more accessible.  The Napoleon pocket is nice, but only fits a my wallet."
"These are cute little socks with a great fit.  Material is soft and they have some give.  After a washing, they still look great and the colors are vibrant. Would buy the again.  Please let me know if you have questions and let me know if the review was helpful."
Nice cleat.  Comfortable straight from the box to the field.
Very nice wallet. Made very well and should last for years.
I am 5'7 and 108 pounds. i have broad shoulders for my frame. i ordered the size large and was not disappointed. The shoulders fit exactly. i could have gone up a size to allow for an even more flowy look. this dress does not need to be tapered as it is a dress meant to be flowy and hippie looking. I do recommend that you order a size up in this dress as if I had ordered a medium the shoulders would have been too tight and it would have compromised the look of the dress. I also like how the dress is longer in the back. it looks just like the photo on me.
"This Bolero matches the dress perfectly and it is very cute, but the material is extremely thin and the whole thing came in a bag, stuffed inside a cardboard envelope which was completely saturated with water from all our melting snow. I wish the company would have used a box to mail the package. The Bolero and dress were undamaged, but this is for my daughter's first communion and I am a bit disappointed with all the wrinkles in the dress and jacket from the poor packaging. Otherwise, it is cute and my daughter loves it. Definitely a good value for the price, though I doubt it will survive much wear."
"Looks adorable, nice lightweight pjs for spring.

Updated: Might be made from magic. I'm not sure what exactly these pjs are made of or where they get the material but I'm convinced there is magic in these. My child is almost 1 and he almost never sleeps through the night. He's usually up once or twice a night because he's hungry, teething, or had a bad dream and needs a quick snuggle. These somehow make the tiny human dictator happy and he sleeps through the night in these. I'm ordering more right now."
Feels great and fit perfectly. Nothing to complain about was all around good. Kept me very warm during the winter on the forklift
"These boots keep my feet warm and dry, even when I need to be outside for extended periods of time, or if they are wet or submerged in snow."
Lovely shirt but much longer in back than on model and very flowy in the front
Very nice shade Pink.  I like the fit and it is soft. I might buy another one in a different color.
"Nice quality white tshirts.  The neck is reinforced and thick, the fabric feels good and solid, not thin and not see through.  The cut is standard fit, not slim fit. What I like is they are not huge like a tent, so if you are large or have a belly then you may want to size up.  These are longer than standard, going a few inches lower than the waist.  They wash well with whites and tumble dry.

I prefer these to two other brands I've tried. They're not complicated and they don't have a logo splashed on them."
Good quality hat for the price. Exactly as advertised!
"The fit is good (I followed the sizing instructions) - a little loose with room to move, but the fabric allows for a look that doesn't appear voluminous."
I gave this to my little sister for her 51st birthday & she loved it! I thought it was darling!
"So glad I purchased these.  I ordered a set from another seller (they came with a small, medium and large cube)  They were fine, but the large size, was smaller than the large from this seller.
They are longer and wider than the other set.  I really needed this larger size.  I love, love, love these.  They are going to make travel so much easier, packing my clothes with these cubes."
These are truly a great shoe for active individuals. Super light and very comfortable.
"Great Fit!  If you like briefs, but hate them being too tight, these are perfect."
"Love, love, love these suit bottoms .  I wear an eight and pants and bathing suits, and these fit me perfectly .  Love the sheared, retro style and polkadots !"
"Just what i was looking for but a little large. Will be ordering the medium. Shiny, stretchy and perfect to add to my fetish wardrobe."
A litte short but i like it its a cute little dress
Love this vest! It fits great! The hoodie is so cool but also detachable. Keeps you warm and looking cool!
They are nice silver hoops perfect if you want something small they seem constructed well I have only worn them one day but they are comfortable and pretty
"I don't usually buy shoes sight unseen, but this choice turned out just fine.  I find the fit and comfort to be in line with the  price.  Would I buy them again?  Yes I would."
What a nice surprise! Ordered these for a wedding and not only did they fit well - they were comfortable! Something in the shoe makes an odd click but it doesn't happen when I walk. Perhaps it's part of the sole of the shoe.
"Great! My husband loves having a mix of basic T-shirts, and these are good quality."
These are great for summer & exactly what I was looking for!!
Cushioned and comfy fit for winter and walking. My husband really likes them and they fit well right out of the box. Sketchers are great.
Great price and great shoe! Nice and clean looking also really light feels just a little like cardboard but fair for the price
Nice product but it's not really meant for busty women.
"NICE BOOTS FOR MOTORCYCLE RIDING, FLEXIBLE, COMFORTABLE AND WILL KEEP THE WATER OFF YOUR TOES IN HEAVY RAIN AT 75 MILES AN HOUR"
"Super thin, super stretchy, soft fabric made of 78% nylon and 22% spandex. Stretch lace at the waist and raw edge (that doesn't unravel) at the bottom of the legs. Useless little diamond-shaped piece of cotton is tacked in at the crotch and is more a problem than anything. I removed it with a few snips and wear panties. So, 1 star off for the unfortunate crotch, but since it can be easily remedied, maybe 1/2 star off would be fairer.

This short doesn't bind or pinch or roll up or down. It just clings to the body and smooths, smooths, smooths. And it's almost weightless due to the 22% spandex. I ordered based upon hip measurement and find this XL short to be too large but wearable. I am going to order a size down and see how a large works for me. I love the feel of the short -- as I said, it feels almost weightless -- and the fact that there is a seam down the back so a more natural line is created (I hate that barrel effect that a solid piece undershort creates). I love the fact that the legs don't roll up and, once I have the right size, that the waist shouldn't roll down.

Machine wash cold. Made very well in Bangladesh."
I bought this to start my SFX makeup kit and practice some looks this past Halloween and it's been awesome. Perfect to pack into a wound and give it that extra texture regular liquid blood doesn't. It's obviously a small container at 1 oz so it can get pricey if you need it in bulk but it's Ben Nye so the quality makes the price well worth it and the size is great for someone like me who is just starting out.
"Great fitting, light weight shoe. Excellent choice for those with a wider foot."
"You can't go wrong with Clarks.  They are always so comfortable, especially when you have to stand for long periods of time or are on your feet all day."
This shirt is awesome! Looks exactly as pictured and love the fit and VNeck. Love the bright rainbow colors.
Loved it no problem with the fit!!
Underwear was too big but otherwise nice product
"The headband works perfectly at keeping the sweat out of my eyes. I have a large head and I was worried that it would be to tight and give me a head ache,  but the material stretched perfectly and was to tight."
"Loved it,  realistic"
We couldn't get our 2 year old little girl out of it.  She slept all night in it.
So beautiful. My daughter is in love with it.
"A bit baggier on the legs than I wanted, but nice fit."
Really comfortable. Good with just a T shirt to about 40 degrees.
I love this purse!!  I get compliments all the time!!
Very nice for all ages! Seems sturdy.
"The price and quality, just great.  Always receive compliments."
"It's ok, not too bad, cotton,somewhat slim design."
Awesome especially for the price. Super easy to get on/off my 4 year old
Very nicely priced jacket with cute button detail. The fabric is a stretch-type polyester & the only con is it's not lined so the seems can be a tad itchy depending on what type of shirt you wear under it.
"So pretty and fits as expected. They fit like a laced glove. Does slip down sometimes when I walk but nothing to aggravating. Creamy tan color with beautiful detailed lace. Very comfortable to wear. Soft and smooth. I would recommend this
Mantian Women's Anti-Slip Lace Socks (Skin). Sample provided for an honest and unbiased review."
I love this. Its so soft to the touch!
nice comfortable jeans with a very good fit
"I'm 5'4, DD bra size and 150 pounds and the size 12 worked perfectly. This is a sexy, flattering fit with lots of stretch. I wish there were more colors! It's the perfect cocktail dress"
I love my my body shaper fits great give my bust a great  lift  now I can wear my low back dresses
"The jeans look great (very deep color black, good stitching, etc.).  They fit well, but after a few hours, they stretch out just enough that a belt is needed.  Overall, I would say that these are good, fit our needs (black jeans for work), and are comfortable to wear."
"These are great shoes. Cute pattern on the leather. The strap is neither to tight or to loose. They are very light weight, making them easy to wear all day."
Nice to order from Clarks . The shoes are always well made and fit as they shoukd
Very nice outfit!!!
"The fabric is comfortable and the color was dead on center to the displayed images.  It's been chilly where I live and these wraps have become indispensable additions to the wardrobe.  After a few practice rounds over a few days I was tying this article up within seconds before darting out the door.  Easily worn, the wrap layers warmly and the ladies have regularly complimented the look.  Good find and purchase, as I have already bought several more to fill out the coat rack in the closet."
"I love the color, style and now I can safely work in the garden without getting all dirty from the mud.  Great boots, very comfortable."
Beautiful! I also got the matching necklace and they really look like real diamonds! Stunning!
LOVE THESE & FINALLY THE PRICE WAS RIGHT. I SIMPLY REFUSE TO PAY MORE THAN I THINK A PRODUCT IS WORTH.
"Love the cotton from India. Beautiful color, just like the picture. Hand wash, line dry and it is ready to wear. It will get a lot of wear this summer.
Easy to dress up with jewelry."
i love this bag.  it is large enough for all my purse things and can even hold a book too!  i would recommend this to any aged gal and feel that she'd be happy.
I love this chain! I've bought several from this company before. The mirror box is great for pendants. I abuse them. I sleep with them. I shower with them. And they stay as beautiful as if they were new. I highly recommend them.
"over the past couple of years i have tried many minimalist kind of shoes - Merrell Road Glove 2, Merrell Bare Access 2, Altra The One, Inov-8 Road-X 233, New Balance Minimus Zeros and Merrell Trail Glove 2s - I just love the Mizuno Ekiden's ... they are my favourite road shoes and i plan to use them on race day (upto half marathon)..... they are very similar (but better) than my favourite training shoe which is the New Balance Minimus Zero.  I have nothing negative to say about them... I just love them...  I think all i need to own now are the Mizuno Ekiden's for racing, New Balance Minimus Zero for training upto 13miles, and Merrell Bare Access 2 for long easy runs which are more then 13 miles long (a bit of extra cushioning to help keep my feet happy when i run over 1.5hrs)"
This is the only style money clip my husband will use. Wallets are bulky and sitting on them hurts after a while. These will fit nicely in your front pocket. Will hold identification and credit cards as well as shield just how much cash you are carrying from view.
I bought this for a costume but was hoping to use afterwards as part of my wardrobe with skirts. I read the reviews and decided to size up just to make sure it wasn't sure tight. It was a good idea and I felt like everything was very held it. I was happy that the fabric was good quality and lined so you could not easily see through.
"This is great for my son, he loves it, warm and great for early fall and spring."
I love it. It's so cute and warm. It was a tad itchy before the first was but after it was fine. No buttons. Well made. And u can't beat the price.
light as a feather.  ultimate in comfort.
Love them! Soupy comfy and can be dressy!!
"I took the advice of others and order one size up. These are very comfortable pants and stay wrinkle free all day. Great fit and very forgiving and flexible material.  They are medium weight but not too thick for summer. I am 5' 4"" and the length is perfect with even a 1"" heel."
"They are just perfect, the polarization is good and the gold finish make them look very good, one thing which is not bad but is not good either is the tipe of end in the back are a bit tight for my head, may be if you change this option will be better, also the manufacturer describes it on the description section."
"I read the other reviews and saw that one woman said her orthotics fit in the boot.  I ordered them knowing they would be a little larger in hopes I could get my orthotic in as well.  I was able to fit my ones from the Dr., Birkenstock, and Dr. Scholls.  Because I can put my insert into the boot, I can wear them all day with great comfort.  I actualy bought two pair, one in the tan suede and one in the brown leather.  A little loose, but otherwise, very happy."
"Great 2 piece that prevents having to check a bag, and still looks good!  Love the brown and pink, and it's so convenient to pack and carry on everything for a week, or two if packing right.  Love this set! It's lightweight too!"
This is one of the best items I have ever purchased.  Great Quality!
Comfy and wipe clean easily
so far so good with this shoes. good stuff for the right price.
Cute but exchanging for a size down.
These shoes are totally awesome.  You feel like you are walking on clouds.  The strap is beautifully made and I think gorgeous.  Perfect summer shoes.
Bought this as a gift for my boyfriend a few years back and he loved it. He used it for about two years (maybe longer).
This is alot prettier in person.  Very sparkly.
Normally I wear a size 8 but got a 8.5 since the sizing is a little slimmer. Going up half a size only made it wider and did not effect the length. Cute plain white shoes and so far comfy!
"great value, they do look like sci-fi but for glass wearers this is as good as it gets"
"I originally ordered a medium because I am small on top and medium at the waist.  I returned the medium for a small as it was much too large for me.  The small size fits me perfectly.  I love my new coat.  The plum color is growing on me (I originally wanted chili, red, but this color was not available in small).  If you are looking for a true rain coat, keep in mind, this coat does not have a hood."
"I have never spent more than 150 for a pair of shoes before, but in my opinion these shoes are worth the price.  I hope they are as durable as other new balance shoes I have worn in the past."
This was a gift to my wife. She Loves them.
man these are the best color . The fabric is so lite and airy. I would order another pair. I am going to order another pair!!!!! I would recommend ordering a size larger though. I wear a 32 and had to order a 34.
"NIce, fits well."
My husband loves these socks. He insists on wearing wool socks year round and these are the best I have found. I particularly like them because they go through the washer and dryer and don't shrink. For years I have hung his wool socks on the line because they wouldn't hold up to the dryer. No more. He likes them because they are thick and long wearing. As long as these are available I will keep buying them.
"The boy short style is good, what I was looking for. I didn't expect the yellow to be so ""fluorescent."" And getting the suit on is a tight fit, pulling up over my hips because of the crossed back strap design. Will keep as an extra suit."
It is hard to buy clothing online.  You are always worried that it will be too cheaply made or materials poor quality.  This is just right. It is soft and just heavy enough to keep the extra chill off in a cool house.
This is a great gym bag. Excellent quality & very durable at a very reasonable price. You will not be disappointed!
I initially bought one to test it out and eventually bought 2 more. These dresses are surprisingly well made. My daughter is 3 yrs old and I got the size 4T and it still fits with a little room for her to grow.
This isn't bad.
Actually a lot nicer then i was expecting.
"I GOT THIS FOR MY HUSBAND FOR XMAS,  HE GO'S THREW SO MANY IN A YEAR AS A FIRE FIGHTER, HE WILL LOVE IT."
I was blown away by the quality of this dress.  The material is very heavy and has beautiful detail.  I'm only 5'1 and wear a size 4-6.  I ordered a small and it was a little snug but I think a medium would've been bigger than I wanted.  I was worried the length would be way too long but surprisingly it was a good length.  It did drag a little without heels but I liked the fact that I could wear comfortable shoes and you couldn't see my feet.  The colors are true to what is shown in the picture and the bustle worked perfect.  I am overly satisfied with this dress and received tons of compliments at the Renaissance Festival.
This corset was a hit at the function I attended and along the route before I arrived.  I won first place for the outfit I put together.  Loved it....
"These have to be the most comfiest shirts dude, I bought another pack after getting a pack for Christmas."
"I needed a quick dress for Wedding and thought I'd give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised how well this fit. I actually ordered a size down from what I normally do and it worked great. I dressed it up with opaque tights, an infinity scarf and lots of bracelets and I felt beautiful.
The dress hangs nicely because of the weight of the fabric the cut. It actually has some shape to it and didn't give me that 'I'm wearing a tent' feeling. I'm not really a dress wearing gal but this is so comfortable, I'll definitely wear it often. The only thing I'd like to see is the arms cut a little more generously. It was a tad snug but not bad. The dress was black and you couldn't tell. You never know when you order clothing online but this was a winner for me."
Xoxo
"Nice item, for a good cause."
The fit was a little tight but doable. The variety & selection was there but not what was shown online.  Overall the quality is good & I would buy again but the next size up.
Stunning! Fits two pairs of cats-eye sunglasses perfectly.
This item is really soft and comfortable. What a great item!
"These are wonderful socks.  I live in Florida where it's always hot and humid.  These don't make my feet sweat (which is a real plus).  They have good padding where you need it, but the sock wicks away moisture, so my feet stay comfortable.  I have purchased several pairs of these socks and highly recommend them."
"The Rustic town key holder wallet comes in a little cardboard box, and inside its wrapped in some tissue paper.

It has an excellent leather scent to it. Not the typical mass produced factory leather stink that most inexpensive leather products have. It's a handsome oakbark / medium brownish leather with nice natural finishes throughout.

The little key snaps are easy on, easy off keysnaps that fit perfectly for keys to sheds, gun safes, cabinets, houses, and other small-ish sized keys. It did not fit my Honda or Ford car keys, which was a bummer, but its great otherwise.

In terms of the two pockets, you could fit about 4-6 credit cards in each one, which would be more than enough for most folks. It might be a little tough to keep currency or coins in it though.

Its a tri-fold wallet that folds over itself and snaps in place with a little antique brass looking snap.

Overall, a great little key wallet if you're looking to keep the inside of your pockets safe from keys, and reduce rattling."
"Fits my husband great, hugs his biceps. Nice material."
"I really liked this dress. It was super soft and comfortable. The collar made it more formal for the office too - throw on a blazer and it's perfect. But, I had to send it back. I prefer dresses/skirts that come down to my knee. The picture made it look like this would work, but it didn't. It was too short. Short enough that if I bent over to pick up one of my babies, I would reveal more than I would like. The pattern was just okay."
Awesome product and another Clicgear product focusing on quality and funcationality. I love this company and they always make high quality and desirable products. I always think buying everything from the same suppliers looks slicker and less confusing.
Wish they still made these
"I like these boots. The only con is the amount of white kitty fluff they attract is annoying though not fault of the boots. Very comfy, sensible heel!

A touch of boho or cowboy depending on your take!"
"Best Amazon clothing Ive ever bought!!! Its so comfortable, flattering, and affordable! Im buying more!!!"
"The colors are vibrant and beautiful and the bag itself seems to be well made.
I don't like BIG totes and already have a few small ones. I needed something mid-sized for my fitness classes. This is PERFECT as my new workout bag. I can fit my towel, big water bottle, wallet and even yoga pad comfortably inside. Of course the yoga mat sticks out but this bag holds it nice and snug.

For the price, I'm very happy with this cute little tote."
This is my second pair of Merrell Pace Gloves. I am an intermediate runner and I have trained for a couple of half marathons. I originally used a Saucony running show but I always had blisters and back pain after a long run. A friend of mine who is an avid runner recommended a more minimalist shoe. I tried out the vibram five fingers but they were a little too minimalist. I could only run about 6 miles max before my feet would be screaming. They also ripped after just a few months. I then found out about these Merrells and I will never use anything else. I have not had any back pain using these and the tread is just thick enough to prevent excessive blisters. They are light weight which is a big bonus. Now when I try on normal running shoes they feel so clunky and like they are forcing my foot into a strange position. It takes a while adjust to the new stride bit it is well worth it.
I bought this for a friend for Christmas last year.  She says it is incredibly warm and not a bit scratchy.  It is pretty special.
"Comfortable pair of shoes..my feet border between a narrow to wide base..
It was roomy and comfortable but fit slightly broader (my toes slide forward into the open toe area sometimes) so I can see how it could be broad to someone with narrow feet"
I love new balance shoes!
"Purchased for my daughter, she loves it!! Very cute and she gets compliments on it all the time!"
Not a true mock turtleneck.
"Magnificent dress, so cute and lovely on little girls"
Daughter said they're comfortable. She wears them often.
"Nice scrubs, but I ordered a medium since they were ""Junior"" fit and some reviewers complained of the size being too snug.  I'm 5'6"" and 130#, small chest.  The medium top was a little too big and the bottoms were way too big.  I'm exchanging them for smaller size.  Other than the size issues, I think I would like them."
"Love it, went back and bought the white one. It looks really nice and fits perfectly."
"I wear them all the time, they are great shoes just to hang out and relax in."
Took a long while to get to me but love  this clog ( wish the other colors were still available) beautiful and comfortable plus came with a cute storeage bag !
"I purchased this dress in gray in a size small. I am 5'4"", 34C on top, 29"" waist, and size 5/6 on bottom. The dress fits snugly especially in the arms but is also a bit stretchy which helps. I considered going a size larger but I wanted the form-fitting look and didn't want the dress to be too long on me. I also plan to loose a little weight which should make it looser, otherwise this dress does show any fat.  However, the material is good quality and I do like the fit on my body shape. I think it will be good for fall/winter with some tights. The kangaroo pocket is a nice touch and the hoodie drawstrings functional. The color is as pictured as well. The dress comes a little above my knees and the hem rolls up minimally. Overall, this dress makes for a nice casual yet stylish look.

I received this product at a discount for my honest review."
"These are really cute boots. Depending on the shoe style, l could wear a 7 or 7-1/2. According to the Spring Step size chart, either would work. Based on previous reviews, I opted for size 37. They are a smidgen loose with thin trouser socks. They'll be okay with regular thickness socks."
"Very cute custome. I received a lot compliments. I'm 5'4"" and 132 lbs. fits perfect but the only problem with my dress was wrinkle in the back. Not sure if was sewing defective or maybe if you order one size bigger could avoid the problem. Other than that I would say ""highly recommended"""
I love this ring !  very pretty..  fits great..
"will get more of this dress in different colors.
Im 5'6"" weigh 135, 34 C , and a small fit perfect"
"Great suspenders!  Large color selections.  The fastening clips are well built, well designed and fasten well also. The location and design of the back fasteners are right on the money.  Suspenders have good adjustability too."
Great tshirts. I don't buy any other brand.
"These pants are a lot nicer than the picture. I def wasn't expecting such a great quality product: the crochet , the fit, the material.. I thought the pants was pricey for what I wanted but it is perfect. worth it. wasn't attracted to the pic just wanted a black beach pants.. but it contours to the body so well."
"The pants and material are great quality and warm.  I am 5'9"" and I wear 32"" waist 30"" height pants.  I ordered the medium size, and they are slightly too long.  With big boots on they are good, however with any other shoes the bottom of the pants legs scrape the ground and tear."
"Sneakers interesting, but I missed with sizes. I will sell these, I will buy 12DM."
"I bought them for my dad, who uses a hearing device & they fit perfect!"
"A little chunky on the wrist, but it looks nice."
"I was worried at first that I might get in a bind because Crocs didn't come in wide widths.  So far though I have been very pleased with them. I wear them with the straps up and they are easy to get on and off and surprisingly they stay on my feet with no effort.  Very comfortable to wear with no socks, they are the easy on and off I need a quick pair of shoes for any environment.  I love them."
Very warm and very soft but it keeps catching on everything and so now there's a bunch of pulled strings on it.
"good fit, for summer wear"
"Perfect with my ""bee dress."""
"At first I wasn't sure about this...it's pretty chunky.  But it's so incredibly warm!! And it's actually super cute.  I've seen other women wearing it (not to say it can't be worn by men) and I'm like yeah, she knows what's up, ha.  But seriously.  It's great.  I've bought four of them now.  Can't live without em! :)"
Awesome belt. Will buy against when this one wears out. Also have a second one that I use for work.
"Comfortable, classic and stylish. I do not like a pointy toe, these are somewhat square shape and the heel is just right. I have no issues with my feet and normally wear size 8.5 M; these fit perfectly. So far the shoes seem to be holding up, but I only wear them around the office. I would buy another pair."
"I'll start by saying that I have had extraordinarily bad luck in the high heels arena.  I've had to donate the last several pairs of heels (not these) because they were fine in the store, but when put to the test of walking a couple blocks to run an errand, my feet were literally bleeding when I got back and it was too late to return them.  Okay, so this leads me to Naturalizers...  First, Naturalizer carries a good selection of ""off"" sizes, and I have an ""off"" size.  Second, this pair (Clava, black) is leather, so I know they'll break in - but pay close attention when ordering because not every pair is leather (those labeled only ""patent"" or ""shiny"" are synthetic).  I received this mid-last week, tried them on, and the fit is darn near perfect.  The vamp (part that goes across the top of the foot) needed a little stretching, but I found the size and the width to be perfect.  They're not too pointy, but very classic.  They're not platforms like the Naturalizer Lennox, and I prefer the sleeker look of the Clava.  Finally, the heel isn't pointy like a stiletto, nor chunky - it really is just right.

I've read some reviews on other sites and it appears that there may be some inconsistencies in sizing not only within the Clava line but also with other Naturalizers.  This is the only drawback of ordering online vs. purchasing in store.  A good return/exchange policy should remedy that, however.

I haven't tested these out & about yet, but I've worn them for hours inside (on carpet & hardwood) and so far, so good.  It's nice to finally have some heels that don't make me want to dive headfirst into a ditch.

**Update: I also got these in the brown snake print... these are NOT leather, and although the same size as my first pair, I found them to be uncomfortable (squeezy) shortly after I tried them on, so they're going back.  I'd stick with leather for these."
Love the colors and they're working well for my foot temp so my feet don't feel sweaty. I'm a size 7-7.5 and they fit me really well
"This is a beautiful Kimono even though it is quite long!  The colors are sharp and bright, and the material is very comfortable."
"Extremely comfortable, not too hot, not too much freedom, doesn't keep the boys shackled in too much either.  Glory."
This fit my Galaxy Note 5 perfect. I actually had a little bit of space left over around my phone that it's not stuffed in the pocket. It just drops in. It's not bulky either. I have it in my purse and it fit great. It the perfect wristlet/wallet.
I bought these for my wife and she loves them. Good polarized lenses. Very light and comfortable.
I really love this top it does fit a little big but I don't like really tight scrubs it does have stretch there is a little hook on it I think thats for a badge in any case I think that it should be moved to the top shoulder for most badges you have wear there now
I had heard that you need to order wester boots a little larger so I did. I needed an 8 1/2 so I ordered a 9. I did not need to. These boots were too big and I had to return them for the 8 1/2. Great boot.
Excelente sueter.
My husband loved these shoes! He is a Merrell fan and this shoe meet his expectations!!! I would highly recommend this shoe!
Super soft and comfy! I like my baby to feel snuggly so they're awesome. :)
This pendant is beautiful !!!!!
"One of my favorites, but, the point is sharp!  Other than that, the piece is beautiful and meaningful.  I bought one for myself, as well as one as a gift."
"These are the best fitting jeans I've ever owned. I was a little worried about how the color would look, but they look really good. Someone else said they were more like bell bottoms than bootcut, but they are definitely bootcut. The denim is soft and has a slight stretch and it seems to be good quality too. I had to wear a belt, but at least the waist wasn't super tight."
"I love these Grandco slippers. I bought them first about 8 years ago, and since then have always had one. They are comfortable, nice looking, casual and water proof. They make a bold statement. I just love them! Now I have two of them.."
Gorgeous Ring! So sparkly and blingy!! So glad i purchased it!!
"Really like the fit it I'd very flattering for tall people with a large midsection as well as pregnant people..not a fan of the diagonal pocket on the left hand side though. Overall it is great though....I wear 3x-4x and it gives me some shape rather than being a box, I also have a longer body so I love maternity clothes they just fit better!"
Great stylish shirts that's why I have just about every Color. Can't miss casual attire.
"I purchased this bag to go out of town last minute for work. I wanted something leather for sure. I was looking around and found this. The size was right. It had a shoulder strap and I like the texture and grain of the leather. Bag is awesome. Seems like it will last for a very long time with some basic leather treatment. Only thing I would have like to have is the lockable zip pulls for when this bag has to be checked on a flight. I just used some strong zip ties to keep the zippers closed.

Overall 5 Star Duffel Bag."
Best astronaut costume we found!
"I ordered up 2 sizes since I wanted to make sure it was roomy.  Probably could have ordered up only 1 size but I am happy with my choice.  I have been looking for a Navy blue vest with inside pockets for over 2 years now.  I don't carry a purse, just my cell phone with drivers license and a couple credit cards so I wanted a vest with an inside pocket.  My old navy vest with inside pockets faded and looked horrible.  This one looks great!"
"Have searched and bought numerous other waist trainers. None that have fit like this. Most bunch and can be seen under clothes. This is absolutely what I was looking for. Great fit, breathable,  and invisible under clothes. Definitely would recommend and purchase again."
"great for the price. cheap, obviously synthetic hair, but it is great for a costume"
"Cute little dress, and comfy for the summer. I am 5'2"" and the dress is very long on me, but the top can be rolled or you could wear it like a strapless dress."
"Very nice dress. Definitely not forgiving of your lumps & bumps. Get your girdle ready, This is a very sexy, classy dress. Runs small"
This is a good jean and very comfortable with a good fit.
"nice shirt , good size , looks good"
Needed a wedding band to wear when we go on vacation so I wouldn't have to worry about losing my real one! Wanted something nice but not too expensive and this ring is perfect. It's really pretty and has good weight to it!! Way better than I expected it would be for the price. Defn recommend it!
Love love love this product!!!
Ordered this little ring as a pinky ring and I absolutely just love it!!! this is true to size all the way around pictured as shown quality is excellent
my friend loves this ring! he  says it looks like it's worth a million bucks!
"I love these boots and got them for a great price. I love the color, I love the dark brown and they fit as expected. I bought a 7, like I have bought before for Frye boots and these fit as well. A lot of the reviews state that they run narrow, and I could see that. I have a narrow foot so they fit me. If you have a wider foot, you may want to go a half size up. I also love the zipper in the back so they are easy to get on and off."
"Good fabric, cat hair does not cling to it (!), good subtle print, sewn well"
"it fits loose. if your thighs rub, it's gonna roll."
This rain jacket was for my son.  I like it because it reflects light and is easily seen.  The XL was perfect for him.  It runs a little big but over clothes it works great.
He's wearing them so I guess he thinks they're fine.  Thank you.
"Very pretty, still in one piece!"
Wife pleased with it !
"fits well, very comfortable, love the color"
"I figured this would be a nice bag, nice color - it's a GREAT bag! It feels well made when you hold it, its got a nice weight to it, and unlike other bargain-priced handbags, it stands on its own and feel sturdy. Before purchasing, I read some of the comments about how it was hard to get into, and yes - the top zip makes the opening a little smaller than it actually is, but it's not an issue at all. I'm planning on buying another in a different color. I purchased the dark pewter, and from the pics it seemed like it would be more gray, and in reality its more bronze than pewter. Still a great looking bag though -"
This replaces the one I wore out.  Great wallet.
"My husband recently had a gastric sleeve procedure and has lost 84 pounds in a short amount of time,  We had to replace all his summer clothing but while the shorts I have ordered all fit well in the body, they are very baggy in the legs, including denim ones.  I saw a review on these and decided to order them.  The legs are perfect, not too tight but not at all baggy!!!  They fit true to size.  I will order more in smaller sizes as he continues to lose weight."
Very nice. I will get a lot of use from this bag.
"Got these shoes for my lady, and she loves it. Came in good timing. We both love the colors and style. Only thing, is they didn't come with a box. Other than that everything was perfect"
I just walked a couple of miles on these and will get more. These are like the old Saucony shoes I haven't found recently. They have good cushioning and are light and vented for summer heat. I usually wear a 9M in street shoes and the 9 1/2M is perfect.
"Looks ecactly like the picture. Very lightweight. Gauzy, somewhat see-through, but sooo soft. My husband has a 44 inch chest, and I ordered the largest size. It says 54 on the tag in the collar, but I don't think it means 54 inches at all. It looks a tad roomy now, but feels like a material that may well shrink. Well, then, I suppose it'll be mine. :)"
I was surprise with the material of this blouse its very nice material it fits perfectly on my size 16 its really really nice blouse.
Well made and came as described. My wife liked her earrings. Of you are looking for an inexpensive solution for giving some earrings as a present this will fit the bill.
Went up a size to have perfect fit. Medium weight material. Nice t- shirt.
"love that they are fleece, my son really liked them"
This is an awesome little dress. Well made and fits like a glove. Very forgiving fit!
"The image for the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Haggar-Men-s-Regular-Fit-Poplin-Pattern-Dress-Shirt/dp/B00GBVNTG4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Haggar Men's Regular-Fit Poplin Pattern Dress Shirt</a>&nbsp;looks to me like a pajama top, but the shirt is much nicer.  The white lightweight blend poplin has slate blue substantial stripes which contrast well, giving it a very crisp impression.  The collar is a little more dressy than a button down, and with the enclosed removable plastic collar stays to keep the fabric put, it can be worn with or without a necktie.  Having a rounded cuff keeps the fabric from fraying as easily as otherwise, and it is closed by using a single button.  There are two on the cuff, so you have the ability to have it looser or tighter.  All stitching was done well and the bottom side seams have a nice little curved piece of fabric sewn in.

I like very much that the bottom button is stitched in blue thread and its buttonhole is also in blue.  This is a cute accent that seems almost like a secret.  The fit is average and because the fabric is thin and white, if you are shy, it's probably smart to wear a t-shirt underneath.  It is a great shirt for hot climates.  This is a very nice shirt and well worth the cost."
"I chose these boots after a comparing tons of other products and reading many reviews. These boots are definitely waterproof. Keep my daughter feet warm and dry. I have a 2 year old with size 6 shoes, so I purchased 8 for her. The inside is covered by a thick layer of faux fur, so definitely you want to get 2 sizes bigger. She has no issues walking with them on some inches of snow. They are a little tricky to put in the first time, but my daughter got used to it quickly."
the length is perfect with a heels. very pretty dress.
The quality of the materials could be a bit better but overall the fit was just about perfect in the bust compared to my true bra size.  And it offered support.  The fabric was ok but feels a bit cheap and scratchy on the outside-not uncomfortable to wear though.  The hook closures were a nightmare to put on at first as they were very clamped.  I am able to put this on without help by turning it around.
The sweater is soft and comfortable. XL fits like an L. Sleeves are a little short. Overall I like it!
"My husband recently was told that he had to stop wearing a belt. Because of his back. So I bought him these. My grandpas used to wear suspenders all the time, said it helped their backs. My husband grumbled some but after he started wearing them he stopped. Now he wishes he would have listened to me sooner. He wears them all the time with all his pants. No matter what he is doing even when outside cutting wood. His lower back hasn't bothered him in a long time now."
"Beautiful bracelet. Can be worn with a fancy dress, my work attire or even dressed up with jeans. Easy to get on and off. I've received many compliments!"
"have always wore these pants, great fit and long lasting, especially for the price"
"I love this look and feel of this dress.  I've received many comments on it as well.  My ""general"" size is 12w.  This dress is an XL.  It's slightly larger than I need, but it's very comfortable and the belt keeps it from looking baggy."
Fits a bit large but this is the way I love it who the heck want a thigh robe on a guy. The material is soft and plush almost like a terry cloth very very soft.
This wig is beautiful! It even looks like it could be my real hair! Gorgeous!
It is a perfect match for the bracelet and looks like a much more expensive item.  Perfect for my Grandson.  He loves it.
"What a beautiful, well-made coat!!
It runs true to size, so order your normal size. The lining is very well made and the buttons on the black raincoat ate silver. Very cute coat thst will last forever!! I ordered the medium, best price!"
This is so perfect and I love it.
Very comfortable fit on your finger. I bought this to replace my real set while I'm pregnant .... And people think it's real. There is one area where the stones are not spaced all the same but I rotate that to the inside of my finger so no one will see.
"Very attractive, I've waited a long time to find the right Burgundy boot and love the color. I'm struggling a bit with the fit. I wear a 6 in shoes so went up a 1/2 size thinking I needed to with socks and their still big. However I'm keeping them because I love the color and should be able to work this thing out. Perfect heel height for style and comfort and the price is so right."
A bit roomy and the material is stiffer than other similar gowns I have purchased
"Wow.  I'm used to fairly flimsy umbrellas, but this one is seriously over-engineered, in a good way.  Plus, rainbows.

UPDATE: Never mind.  On the third use, it broke.  Pushing the button sends it up, but pushing the button again only partially collapses it and no amount of pushing and grunting and swearing will make it fully collapse.  Emailed company and they said they would send a replacement ... but never did.

ANOTHER UPDATE: The company contacted me and finally sent me the replacement.  Either I am more careful with this one OR it is simply not broken.  Either way, I am enjoying it.  Colors are bright and so far the over-engineered thing goes up and down and protects me from the rain."
"Arrived very fast and its is really a nice hoop skirt, the 5th hoop makes it great for taller people, it puts the last hoop closer to the ground, its adjustable, the hoop wire slide together for less fullness, that was not advertised and is a great think.  Oh yes and fully extended it has great fullness which is great for reenactments or really full dresses."
"Great leather slip-on for casual wear. Sizing runs a bit on the larger size. I normally wear a 12-12.5 narrow, so I bought the size 46. Exchanged them for the size 45 which fit better."
Got these for my son and he loves them.  Super lightweight!  Flexible beyond belief and loves wearing them to coach Jr. High sports!  Nikes are not for wide footed types... they usually run small so order 1/2 size or so up.
I'm in love! Super comfortable and really pretty.
I bought these for our 7 year old daughter. She can put them on and off all by herself which is an awesome plus! They stay warm and dry and come far enough back that snow doesn't get onto her wrists. They will work well to pass down though our son as well. They have made it through two winters so far with no holes.
Tough to get on think frames. But works great once it's on!
"I've never seen a pair of trousers quite like these, a really different product.  They look like denim jeans, but oh so soft and comfortable.  I tried these Boy's Size 12 out on a couple of my grandsons, all tall for their ages.  The 9 year old was the correct height, but he's a bit husky and these jeans are cut SLIM.  Really slim.  They are just not going to work on this future linebacker.  His wiry and slim 7 year old brother will be an ideal candidate for these in a year or two, depending on how much shrinkage shows up.  In the mean time, we're putting him through a trial wearing with the cuffs rolled up.

These are very, very nice looking jeans and would be best used for dress up events or school.  Taking these hunting, playing flag football, or snow sledding will, I expect, quickly result in a damaged pair of jeans.  They ain't denim and these things will never replace traditional jeans.  But they have their place.  They look super, and the material feels so nice that I'm going to be on the hunt for a pair for myself. By the way, I've checked and Amazon is not currently offering them in men's sizes.  But I'd buy a pair if they did."
"Love these shoes!!!
Soft insole and can wear them for hours... Very comfortable!!"
"I rocked this mask at a Masquerade party and got good reviews. Plus, the metal bent around my face well and stayed in place while swing dancing."
Great Boot !  Very comfortable .  Good value for price.
"Appear to be good material, fit as marked and would certainly purchase again. Guess Walmart has lost my business for a while."
"Gorgeous set, great quality, not cheaply made, great price and fast delivery. Highly recommend and will use this seller again."
Feel nice and last
This is by far the best leather belt I've bought. I'm heavyset and short and my belts hold back and up to some pressure. I wear it 10 hrs a day 6 to 7 days a week. Barely any stretch no ripped out holes no breaks. the buckle is simple and strong. I'm very impressed. my son just asked for a belt like mine because the ones he gets at WA**art keep falling apart. I'm ordering him this one. Thankfully though in a smaller size lol.
"My husband loved his ring and the price. All his friends compliment it because it doesn't look cheap at all. If you (and your husband) aren't picky about brands or pricey jewelry, get this band for your hubby and he'll love it. It hasn't gotten scuffed up either, so the metal holds up well. Might be a different story if you're in the construction field though, so take that into consideration."
"I noted ""fit as expected,"" as the reviews and manufacturer suggestion indicated they run small.  my ego prevented me from following that advice, so I had to return it; my bad!  having said that, I haven't given up hope -- I will work toward fitting into this item at some point, but i will say this corset is BEAUTIFUL, and beautifully made. ladies, if you are thinking about ordering this, pls be honest with yourself. save yourself that sting, if you know what I mean ;)"
"THESE ARE SO AMAZING. I love them so much, seriously. I cannot say enough good things about these sandals."
"I've been wanting a pair if red pumps for years and I've been eyeing this Michael Antonio pair for almost just as long so I finally purchased, and I'm so happy I didn't wait even one more day. These heels are HOT!! And they are a good height without being stupid tall (I swear some heels are made so extremely tall, I look like a baby giraffe walking for the first time).
I normally wear 6.5 so ordered a half size up based on other reviews. I probably would have been fine with 6.5, but now I have room for inserts so I'm not complaining!"
My 13 year old daughter loves her new shoes.  She gets compliments everytime she wears them.
"I could never wear strapless bras until I found this one!  I absolutely love it.  I am small framed but have a large chest and it stays up doesn't cut into you and doesn't cause a ""uniboob""!  The back looks like you don't have on a bra!  it is FANTASTIC!"
Super cute and fit just right! What more could I ask for with a shoe I bought on the internet.
"I love these pants! I will be so disappointed when my little guy outgrows the biggest size. These are soft, easy to get on and off for diaper changes, and great neutral colors that go with almost anything."
"LOVE THIS SHIRT!! Got so many compliments when I wore this. I got an XL but it was a little bigger than I was expecting. However, I loved that it was so roomy! Represent Teen Wolf!"
Cute but all the knots that are in the bottom to give the fridge that cute look came untied during the first wash so that was pretty frustrating to have to fix
love the comforting feel of this sports bra.
"Delivered on time, quality good."
"Fit as expected, They are very comfortable & stylish for modern fashion and can go with just about anything. I would recommend them to anyone."
"The socks run a little small, but they are made well. You get a lot of socks for the price."
"I love this coat due to the large stand up collar, snap and zipper front, snap on large pockets, huge hood that actually covers your head!.  Only draw back is that the 1X does not allow a large sweater or sweat shirt under it or it's to small for me in the shoulder. I'm normally a size 18/20  Other than that I'm very pleased. It does make you look like a large marshmallow, but when it's really cold, who cares I want to be warm.  What's also nice is that it can be subjected to light rain without soaking through.  How can you beat this coat?"
grand daughter is going to love this. Shopping for charms to add to it.
These are nice earrings for throw on days.  Great deal for the price.  I also have them in other colors.
Fit but a bit tightly.
"Super cute and flattering fit. I second what another reviewer mentioned - it is a bit small in the torso. (It just fits me length-wise, but it's close...) For reference, I'm 5'6"". I do have a rather long torso, and it works, but you'll need to size up to ensure your body length is accommodated."
Cute and my son loves it for all his soccer stuff.
"I really like the darker, more textured leather brown band. I also like that the picture is very accurate at the watch face-size. The last watch I bought came to me and the watch face was HUGE. So the description was very accurate here. It was delivered very quickly... about 2 days and came in its own box. Very nice!"
I love the shoes and they are super comfy! The only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 is that they are a bit more squishy than I expected.
My wife loves it! What a perfect gift for Valentines Day. Thanks!
"Bought this for my Dad.  He loves them.  He tells me they fit perfect.  They are a little expensive, in my opinion, but worth it."
my mom loved this so much she asked for another. It's nicely made and very comfortable. The price was great also. highly recommended.
Have a small head.  Used to buy Oakley's kids glasses for double the price.
Nice High visibility...
"Well designed robe, exquisitely manufactured, light weight and deliciously warm."
"Always have liked the Carhartt clothing. Worn their stuff for years. I can deal with it, just wish I had ordered the the large instead of X-Large."
Absolutely beautiful! Very pleased with the quality and the ample size. The price was also a great point!
"Very satisfied with this purchase! I ordered this ring to replace my wedding ring set. Pictures just isn't enough for this ring. It's definitely a must buy especially if your low on funds and looking for a durable ring that doesn't look cheap or fake. It DOES NOT fade nor does the stones lose its shine. I've ordered so many rings looking for the perfect one and this by far is the best and as close to real as you can get for the price. Very comfortable and not too big or too flashy. I've  had my ring for about 6 months or so now and I wear it daily. The only time I take it off is when I'm cleaning with harsh chemicals (bleach, Lysol).

For cleaning I suggest soaking in water with dishwashing detergent and a cap of vinegar. Use a toothbrush to get into the groove, rinse and looks new all over again.

I've also purchase my husbands band (comfort fit) from this company over a 2 years ago and it still looks new. The quality of their products is awesome. I can't say enough about this ring nor the company. You will enjoy!"
"My mother ex in-law loves it, absolutely beautiful. I'm now considering getting one for myself, just smaller than I thought"
Very nice shoes. Looks great and are very confortable.
Just as described. Lightweight material. The two slits go up the the waist line.
"I love these! They aren't a massive 7, the fabric is stretchy and they're perfect for casual work pants.  Pockets are a little small but go figure--they're women's pants."
The earrings are very pretty.  The color is rich.
TOOOOOOOOOOOOO CUTE for words!
"Keep your large stuff together, your mid-size stuff together. Avoids the need to take everything out of your suitcase only to be put it all right back in.  What a god send for keeping organized when traveling!"
Love this watch! It's badass and looks great. Very durable too
LOVE LOVE LOVE thsee shoes.  I bought them in multiple colors. They are that rare mix of super cute and super comfortable!
"This shoe is not just chic but well designed, with high quality materials and is beautiful. Ive gotten loads of compliments and it makes your feet and legs look great and of course your outfit too. This is a winner."
I've worn these every day since I  received them.  I  Love how they look and you don't even know they are in.  They are lightweight but very sturdy.  I would definitely buy them again!
"I'm never disappointed by Rockport shoes. These took a little bit of break in to fit comfortably, but that is typical for me as I have high arches."
I like the added support much better than my previous.
I had purchased another model of watch winder and one of the components was not turning anymore. My husband had 3 watches and I had one that needed this motion. This model not only solved the problem but looks very nice on his bureau. The wood grain  matches our furniture and looks  more expensive than it really was.
I like it very much... Meets my expectations 100%
"Not sure if these are really 100% authentic, but they're super cute. The only thing that stinks is that the frames are heavier than the arms so they fall off really easily."
"I love the fabric! Nice quality, not the light-cheaply made feel some shorts can have. Will definitely buy again."
"Like it a lot,rear other ear ring got from here"
They seem a little shorter than some I've bought in the past.
"I love these shoes! I have plantar fasciitis and Achilles tendinitis and haven't been able to find anything to make my feet not hurt but these shoes are amazing, within two days of wearing them I have hardly any pain! Would recommend these to anyone with foot pain. They aren't hard to get used to and the arch isn't too high like others have reviewed."
"I love this holder; it's sturdy, tough, and good-looking. If all you need is to hold a few cards (I carry around 5-6 in mine), it's perfect. I wouldn't recommend folding bills and trying to cram them in though; you end up fumbling around too much any time you need to get anything out of the holder.

The build quality is top notch, but you should definitely not expect this to be a ""high class""-style item. The leather used is thick and hardy, not thin and smooth like something from an Italian fashion designer. It's more ""blue jeans"" than ""suit and tie"". If that's what you're looking for, it's perfect. The leather is strong and a little too smooth (when I first got mine, it didn't look right until I bent and kneaded it a bit) and the stitching is very strong. The color is great, too.

I usually carry my necessary cards (debit, ID, health insurance, etc) in this sleeve in my right back pocket and my cash in my left... that way I'm not sitting lopsided on an inch of cards, paper, and leather."
"Wonderful thick, bulky winter socks for wearing around the house.  I love them."
Adorable novelty watches. I intend to purchase more of these!
"I ordered these based upon my waist size as specified in the size chart.  Some people mentioned that they run small, and I was just on the upper edge of size 9 so I ordered size 10.  BIG mistake, they were huge.  When they arrived the sizes shown on the factory package was hip size, which corresponds with my normal size of 8, so I returned the size 10 and ordered size 8 and they fit perfect.  Checking Amazon's size chart which you will find on other panties will show you the correct sizing for these as is shown on their package.

They are comfortable to wear, the leg openings stay in place and don't ride up, and the fabric is a nice thick cotton.  The elastic could be better, though, it is narrow and a bit scratchy.  Maybe it will soften with more washings.  Would be perfect if the manufacturer used a wider and softer elastic."
Great ring for the price.  I ordered a second in another color.  Arrived well packaged with a small red pouch to store it in.  Very happy with this ring
"Beautiful color, beautiful feel. These are lovely shoes and fit very nicely!"
Great product and a fair price.
"Need another pair though!,water of any sort,even light snow renders these worthless. They fall apart at the toes every time!(3 pairs now) 3 seasons each pair."
Great for either casual or dress.
Most of the time I have problems with pants being to baggy in the legs and seat.  These fit great.  Much better than I expected.  I ordered them an inch larger in the waist than I usually do because I normally ware a 33x32 which they did not have.  The 34 are not too big.
"This shoe horn is amazing.  It is much more ""solid"" than shoe horns used in shoe stores.  It works great."
I love this shoe the fit is great
"Great price, like the color comfy not too big not too small perfect for me."
"good material, I originally ordered the 34(my slack size and was some what small and snug), I missed an earlier review that with these shorts tend to run a bit on the smaller size.
Best feature is the Smart phone extra pocket I've a 4s with a ""mophie"" battery charger, it  slides in and out well for easy access. Will be looking for this extra smart phone pocket on all future purchases of slacks and shorts.
This was as surprise, as in the description info was not listed as a feature and should have been."
Im a size 6/8 32dd.  Bought a Medium.  It adorable!  Definitely recommend!  Have the crinoline to go underneath as well.
Very cute. Just what I expected. Nice and soft.
"Bought these for my grand-daughter who never seems to be able to keep shoes on her feet. She's 11 yrs. old and whenever we need to leave she ""have to put my shoes on"". Drives her mother crazy! Not any more. These are her 'go to' shoes. And the nice thing is they were priced at a Pay Less price. No $55 dollar price tag. And they are quality leather. Would highly recommend for style and all over cuteness, as well as a good buy."
For the price it's ok. It gets the job done
gave one to bff
Fun designer tape. Not sure how sturdy it is but the design was too fun to pass up.
My husband looks good in these they fit nice ty
Stays on.
MY CLIENT LOVED!!
"They got here on time fit well , I was hoping for larger pockets but thats ok , It does have small ones that do while your out on the jetskee"
Nice fit for a cool morning/evening walk.
Love this dress so much the product is so nice so I advice who so ever wanna buy it should go ahead
"This backpack is great to take on trips and use a day pack, we just did so across Europe. It folds very small, in fact if it had a compression sack of some form, it could probably half as small as it does into it's own pocket. We've not experienced any issues with the material. It's not big, but we had two bottles of water, a rain-jacket, a sweater, a smaller camera and some other stuff in it without it sagging too much or being uncomfortable. The netting material on the straps is nice and we didn't sweat much wearing it.

Funny enough, in Portugal a department store was selling the exact same backpack, just not Eagle Creek branded and bright green for less than $10. So maybe shop around and see if it's available from a third-party before settling for this one."
These are by far the most comfy shoes I have ever owned. Like walking in a cloud.
I didn't actually buy this bag for purse I thought it to hold my iPad mini and it's absolutely perfect.
Very comfortable and warm (but won't make you sweat to death in hot weather either). The jogger fit is also flattering especially on my small frame. Gives me some meat on my bones lol. Am planning on buying more!
Broke in fairly quickly and fits well. Showing a bit more wear than i like though so i may update this review later on. Good boots last a year at least and right now i'd say these have about 6 months max but we'll see.
This is my go to. I've bought them in multiples.
"I am quite shocked at the fit and quality.

Although it is not Wool, it is about comparable to a blazer you might buy for $150-200 at department store.

Looks very nice, fits very true to size.  Love that they carry size 50.  Totally worth it."
"Things are too tough, I am hoping they will break. LOL"
"Love that Crocs have finally come around to making attractive, non-""orthopedic"" looking shoes in the last few years. This style is even cuter in person/on.  Seems impossible, but they are even lighter than ""original"" Crocs. The plastic they use for this model (a bit jelly-like) is less sturdy than the harder plastic used on the ""original"" Crocs, but not unstable and still quite comfortable. Really like the matte translucency of the color. I have narrow heels/ankles; adjustment on the last hole seems to work just fine for me. The closure hook is easy but takes getting used to. An easy hose-down keeps them clean. LOVE my purchase! The lucky few of you who fit 8-9-10-11 get to pay $20 for them (unlike myself). ;)"
"My daughter loves the Bloch Zenith ballet shoes! They do not have to be sewn, and they fit pretty well.  Good quality also...would definitely recommend! Regarding sizing, my daughter's street shoe size is between an 8 and an 8.5 and I purchased the size 7.5 ballet shoe."
Purchased for my daughter as her last coat was getting too small. This has been a great coat. She stays warm and loved it (we live in OH for reference). The only thing is the hood can be zipped off. Where the hood connects to the zipper has come unstitched and I will have to stich it back together. I don't know if this was just weak stitching OR if it is from my daughter snagging it when putting on her backpack or cello to go to school. It could be either or really.
"ultra lightweight, compactable. I'm 6'1 205 proportional fits perfectly, a little extra length so I can bend over and still remain fully covered with no breeze up my back or down my crack. I can get a thick shirt under it no problem but would have difficulty putting it over a jacket"
actually I gained some weight and gave them away
"the picture does not give this ring justice,  It is a true amber not quite as red as shown.  The silver band is a beautiful ivy vine.  It is a medium sized stone that take up the majority of finger below the knuckle. I love mine and use this seller all the time"
Love it so much. Big and cute
"I'm currently in Nome Alaska and in July the temperature is in the mid 40's (feels like mid 30's). I didn't come as prepared as I thought and ordered these out of necessity. I put them on right out of the box after putting my arch supports in. They fit perfectly about how New Balance 9.5 wide sneakers fit. I'm not used to hikers and these are stiff but I have no choice but to walk in rainy, cold, muddy conditions. I have no vehicle to drive in and I don't like to waste money on cabs. It's about 1.5 miles to the grocery and back. These hikers kept my feet warm and dry and my step secure on the slick mud. I know it will take a while to break these in but I'm so glad I got them especially because I paid less than $35 for them.
Update 7/19: They are broken in already. They don't feel nearly as stiff as when I first put them on. They are holding together fine as the weather is getting worse. Harder rain and dipping temperatures, my feet are still warm and dry every time."
I've yet to own a pair of Camper shoes that I didn't love. This is just a great brand with fabulous quality and designs.
"I bought these based on feedback by others.  I find them to be comfortable, but wish they had a waistband.  They are very comfortable and do not ride up."
I love these shoes...they are super comfortable but don't look dorky. These are my sons second pair and he loves them...I love that they aren't flip flops or crocs;)
"Great shoe, great fir, comfy"
Love the glasses work as expected and it comes with the cleaning cloth and a nice pouch to put them in
Great and very comfortable.  Wash well.
The pink is very pretty.  The earrings are light and very well made.  Just gorgeous. Going back for more colors.
Love the fit!!! The material is high quality...great to wear on its own or under a blazer for a more relaxed look!
"Ordered dark red and it's a gorgeous color. Fits nice. Comes with 2 sets of straps,  which I'm thankful for, because the wider ones will provide more support. I'm giving it 4 stars, because I wished it had French cut legs. Think I may buy the green one as well!"
Great idea and worth it.  It is easy to forget you have it on a shirt and leave it.  Which is good and bad.  But it works absolutely perfect.
"The suit is great. Looks and feels like a man's professional suit. However, I ordered a 4 and the ""4"" is more like a 4T. I have a black 4T suit already and I compared them both and they were IDENTICAL to each other- pants, jacket, everything. So if you want more like a 5T or a 4, go for a 5."
Really cute and fits good. I got a size large and I wear a 34D and it fits good. I just wish there was a little bit more coverage but if you wear this under a low cut shirt it looks really cute.
"I bought these for my ""Great Gatsby"" party, so they'll do for that. They are not a real quality piece, but will do for one night. I am also a novice ballroom dancer, so if you are thinking of using these for ballroom, I'd spend some extra dollars and get a quality shoe like ""Very Fine"".  With the riggers of ballroom, these shoes will not last you long."
"It fits beautifully, PER SIZE CHART.  I was alarmed and almost didn't order it because I had to order a size XL (I have never worn an XL in anything - medium or large at most.).  I got out the tape measure and checked, and ordered per the size chart.  It fits perfectly (5'7"", 170lbs, not busty).
Comparison:  I ordered a Maggie Tang white polka-dot dress at the same time (actually, a mistake; I didn't think I'd ordered exactly the same color) and so I can compare the two.  The Maggie Tang fabric was advertised as 100% cotton, but felt like a cheap blend, had a long waisted look that wasn't flattering, as was too short with a zipper was on the right side (usually it's on the left, so this was odd).  This fabric is better: good fabric with a cotton feel (thicker cotton) but the nice stretch characteristics, style is more attractive, and the length is good (just below the knee). Zipper on this one is in the back.  No pockets (pockets would make it better!)."
I am definitely a Sperry fan! These shoes make a great statement with everything I wear them with; I have received nothing but compliments on these shoes.
"I love the concept, and was excited to find this item, (my mom had one) but to date I haven't actually used it.  Figured it would be great at the airport to drink water, don't like fountains."
wear them all the time. True to size. very cute!
Great boxers and an even better buy. If you ever are stuck on what to get your guy this is always a great gift idea. Everything fit great and feels soft.
"I love these sandals. They are so comfortable and stylish. I wanted something a little different than a flip flop and these fit the bill. I put them on and didn't want to take them off. They really do feel like your walking on yoga mats. I need more colors. I have received numerous compliments and they go with anything, jeans, skits, shorts. I throw them int eh gym bag to wear after a hard workout. I don't slide in them either."
Very comfortable and true to size. The heel isn't too high which makes them good for a long wear. I love them
I did great picking these.... Looks good on me
Fits perfect. I bought 2 I love it!!!
"beautiful dress, My daughter wears a size 6 and the size 6 was a little big, but its looks great"
"Great, nice looking wallet.  Perfect for front pocket carrying"
"I love it thank you so much ,  I advise everybody to buy this one is very comfortable I like it"
Cute necklace. I got many compliments.
"These are the best slippers I have ever know.  So warm and comfy and I washed them for the first time in a bag for delicated, placed them in the sun to dry and they are still perfect!  Thank you Isotoner"
Size 8-9 fits my 9 year old son perfectly.  It is so hard to find not overly-character-y pjs for boys and my son at this stage is just not ready for buttons or solids.  I am so grateful to have found these.  We both appreciate and love them so much!
I love the dress.  It's very comfortable.
I love these shoes. Very comfortable. So comfortable that I bought them in 3 colors.
"Needed sweatshirts (prefer hoodies) for working out. At $10 a pop, went for 4 different colors at once.

Warm, soft, comfortable, and a perfect fit."
"very bright and pretty, only thing it is kind of rough around the edges your can't see it but you can kind of feel it"
"Since all sandals are not comfortable for me since I broke my ankle a few years ago, I am more than pleased with these shoes.  I LOVE Earth shoes and would not hesitate to buy them again!"
"Cons: sole is slippery and, as others have said, it is made of fabric like material not rubber. It wears off in threads. Weird. Probably less expensive to make. They are pretty costly.

Pros: really comfortable - spreads my abused 49 year old toes apart in ways that feel like something I have always needed. Not used for painting my toenails as I don't want to get polish on them. It's completely therapeutic. Even though they cost a lot I figure my feet are worth it. Will buy another pair for sure. Love the leopard design.

On fit: I wear a size 8.5 tennis shoe and found the 7-8 size fit perfectly on my feet. I like my sandals to fit my feet exactly the size they are. I trip if they are longer. Width perfect and decent arch support. Toe spreaders are a comfortable padded cloth."
Pretty and comfortable after removing the side stays.  They eventually protrude and poke you.  I just yank them out and then the bras are perfect.
"Nothing to complain about, a little puffy on the top part, but otherwise ok.  I washed it first, because it had a very funny smell.  length is nice, not too long but just right for traveling."
Runs very large.  Order a size or 2 down!
"Holds my wallet, my phone and everything else I can stick in the outside pockets like my chapstick, flossers, Tylenol, it's perfect for someone who doesn't want to lug a huge bag around, I love it"
"I was worried about these at first.

I'm used to buying ridiculously expensive shoes and boots. I was leery about these...they were ""cheap"" at $26. I was relatively convinced I would put them on, and they would promptly fall apart and destroy my feet.

Wrong!

These are surprisingly (VERY surprisingly!)  comfortable and stylish. They fit perfectly (size 9), they don't squeeze, and they certainly haven't fallen apart. These are primarily my go-to boots now."
"This item arrived in a timely manner with adequate packaging. I love Teva flops, I wouldn't buy any other brand. So comfortable! They are more expensive than other flops but to me they are worth it. These shoes last for years and your feet will thank you for wearing them."
"Great looking shoes, provide arch support. They do run small so order a size and a half bigger. My son tried them and they fit with little room left over and he wears size 5 in Saucony. He did say they were the most comfortable shoes he wore. He said he could walk all day without his feet getting tired so its a good thing since he complains he gets tired easily. I took off one start for sizing issue. I ordered 1 size up and its already his size. Other than that its a great stylish shoe. Looks very sharp"
"Great stylish pink shades  Very funky. I am very happy with this purchase. The shades are very light & comfortable, I will be wearing these all summer long"
"I have very picky feet but own a number of Clarks sandals and clogs. Their styles tend to appeal to me. I had my eye on these sandals and finally gave in and ordered them in black. I'm delighted that they were comfortable right out of the box. They felt true to size (6 1/2 M). The heel height is perfect and since the heel is thick, the sandals are not teetery at all. I like the looks of them with pants, jeans, shorts and capris. I have a good number of pairs of sandals, or else I would consider ordering them in another color. I expect to really enjoy these."
"I love these colorful pants, they fit nice and are comfortable."
Love these shoes. On my second pair !
BONITO PERO UN POCO GRANDE
"Super pleased with this product. I am 5'1 and 100 lbs. The XS fits beautifully. It is a touch long but at 5'1 I think that's going to be a challenge with any trench. The shoulder and arms were exactly what I was looking for with a close fitting coat. I can see why some people would find it tight if they were broader through the shoulder or wanted to wear more layers underneath. The sleeves were about 1/2"" too long but not noticeable to others. Overall, I would definitely recommend giving this jacket a shot. The quality was superb, nice heavyweight fabric, fun lining, and the stitching looks tight."
"My daughter loves to mix and match the flowers with the pretty headbands! They look amazing! We went to the mall yesterday and we saw almost identical flower headbands for about $20 Ea.! My Mom said "" My goodness! Gracie must have a dozen of these! I cant believe how much you spend on her hair accessories!"" I am so happy with these, they look so adorable on my 6yr old daughter and they are very well made! She gets so many compliments on them! The store is so accommodating... Thank You Life Products for making such beautiful and affordable headbands :) I will definitely buy more and recommend these to all her friends!!!"
"Great bag! Really stylish and well made. I would give it 5 stars if there were pockets on the inside...which I personally prefer. There are none which is unusual for any purse let alone a tote size bag. Otherwise, I love it!"
These are great looking pants. My son got these for a cruise and they were comfortable and fit true.
My husband loves the fit and style of the pants. In law enforcement
"I usually wear a 7 1/2 but these come in only whole sizes, as sandals usually do.  I often end up getting a 7, but in these had to go with an 8.  Bought these years ago at a shop in the MPLS airport and the strap recently broke.  I like them so much I was glad to find them on Amazon.  I do wish they fit around foot a bit better, like held your foot in better, but I am not wearing them when I am going on a walk.  But they are fine all day at work, and I am an LMT so on my feet a lot.  The artificial stones are very pretty.  I also have the white ones with the silver and gold stones, and they really dress up an outfit."
"These are SO comfortable!  I usually wear a 9, but bought an 8 as other reviews said they ran large.  They fit perfect, but I could probably have gotten the 9 and been OK.  My toes are closer to the edge than I'm used to, but they're still fine.  The foot bed is so comfortable.  I'm happy I purchased these to wear with my skirts for the summer."
"Surprisingly comfortable and pretty. Can be worn for daytime dress-up, or evening."
"This is well made and I love the color. I believe the fringe will hold up well for any level of dancing or just as a Halloween costume. It fits well, but there are some areas that may rub after a few hours of dancing. These were not made to be worn all day against bare or sweaty skin. The straps will rub after a while. It could be worn over a tan body suit or nylon top for more comfort if it is going to be worn and/or danced in all day. It looks stunning and there is nothing wrong with how beautiful it shines or how it hangs from the arms and chest."
had a funny smell but that left after a few hrs. thick soled and sturdy. waterproof.
Looks great and fits great. The fabric is very nice and NOT think.
"Fits, washes, and looks great.  Would recommend the robe to everyone."
Every so slightly large for my head but really cute and is going to go so well with my Agent Carter Disneybound!
Looks good. Seems solidly built. Let time tell...
not cold enough yet
"Beautiful hat that fits great,  looks great,  and is super light! Shipping was free and packed carefully and secure,  but took 9 days."
"I love these pretty beads! I purchased these beads to thread onto a Pandora-style bracelet with some silver spacer beads. These pretty blue beads came in a nice variety of coordinated designs, with no more than two of any design. I liked the differing blue hues and designs in this collection. The beads threaded easily and quickly onto my bracelet once I screwed off the bracelet end. For variety and interest, I loved adding unique silver spacer beads to these blue glass beads on my bracelet. I recommend you line up your beads in the order you want them in before putting them on to your bracelet, that way, you can play around with the arrangement without having to take beads on and off of the bracelet chain. I love that I can easily and quickly rearrange the beads on my bracelet. I received these beads quickly and shipping was a breeze. I am impressed so far with the quality of these beads and would purchase from this company again."
Sexy as hell hubby loves it even if I wish it to be a tad bigger.
"I mean, they're like $3 so who cares. They look similar to the picture so 5 stars in my opinion."
"I purchased these boots in maple. The color of the leather is gorgeous and the fit is good except the toe box is very narrow. I had mine stretched at a cobbler. I am somewhat of a Frye collector - so my only problem is I have a personal inventory to compare these boots to. These boots are made in Mexico not the USA or Spain where many high end Frye boots are made. The leather is much thinner than all of my harness boots as well as all of my knee high Frye boots which are lined inside. The zipper is a bit sticky. I think the price reflects the Frye name and not the quality of the boot. For about the same price, one could get Frye cavalry boots made of thicker leather which will probably last longer. However, you will note I didn't return the boots. The color is amazing, the outside zipper detail is beautiful and the lower heel is very comfortable. I also ordered an 8, down one size from my regular 9 - I should have ordered an 8 1/2 instead. I admit it, I loved these boots too...."
Got exactly what I ordered and expected. Thank you for not making this difficult.
"It has good lateral support and good cushioning in the ball of the foot. A little bit heavier than my new favorite (Saucony Triumph), but overall I liked it."
I love these shoes.  they are my 4th or 5th pair.  I wear them year round.
Nice watch and bracelet.  Looks like the Anne Klein set that sells for $150.00  have to have both sized. ONLY had for 2 wks. Don't know how it will hold up.
Lovely 3 dimension butterfly. I bought one as a gift and I wear the second one almost all the time. Great price. I would recommend this.
"Overall this is a great ring. I got this ring because I dropped my tungsten ring on my garage floor and it broke. So this was a quick solution. The ring is extremely light. You will hardly even notice you are wearing it. The only downside is that the ring scratches very easily. I think this makes the ring have some character, but my wife doesn't feel the same way. For the price a great buy."
Very comfortable would have likened it a bit longer. But no complaints
"Super nice pair of shoes for a great price! The first day I got them I worked out in them and they felt as if I had wore them for a while, no 'breaking them in' needed! They are so comfortable and I usually wear an 8 1/2 so that's what I ordered in wide width and they fit perfectly! I wouldn't want them any smaller or bigger."
I absolutely love it!! I'm going to wear it everyday
"I bought the infant size for my 1 year old.  While it's still a little big, the quality of the hat is very high.  Because of the sizing issues, I would only give it 4 stars."
I own these shoes in Black and Brown.  They are the most comfortable dress shoes I've owned in years.  When I am in them I am in them for hours on end and they are still comfortable.  I'll be looking to see if I can get a lighter color for Summer.  Worth every penny for this sharp looking shoe.
"I bought this for my husband, and he loves it! It fits as expected, and it's very unique. I would definitely buy more in different colors!"
"Gifted these to my mother for Christmas and they were the perfect fit (and gift). She loved them, they are super soft and comfortable, she wears them every day!"
"I bought these while I was in A-school, and used them for everyday (garrison) boots.  I wore them for the entire 5 years of my enlistment, as well as the RAT version during my deployments.

Pro:
Comfortable and look sharp in uniform
Fairly easy to clean with everyday wear and tear
Comfortable to hike in- Often my foot tends to rub on the top of the boot along the 1st metatarsal (big toe side).  The laces going nearly to the toe allows a snug, comfortable fit along the length of the top of the boot.  Wore them often for hump-day hikes (usually 2-3 mile hikes with 50-60lb packs on fire-breaks, rarely through mud or anything that would get us too dirty to shower and changed for 0700 formations.  So called because they were usually on Wednesday mornings... our platoon sergeant thought it was pretty funny way to break PT monotony.)
stiffened toe cups (THESE ARE NOT STEEL TOE BOOTS) stiff and durable, even after extended wear
Sole is durable and comfortable - pretty good for boots and utes running
fit comfortably through break in period.

Cons:
Not immediately apparent, but there is a 1/4 inch ""shelf"" where the upper meets the sole (where the sole stitching is in the picture) that tends to accumulate mud and grime
Again, seemly due to this ""shelf"", they seem much more difficult to extract your feet from sunk in mud than other boots I have worn.
The heel cups cracked at the top about a year after wear on both boots - jagged piece rubbed right were calcaneous meets achilles tendon (top of the heel) until I snipped that piece out.  Afterwards it was fine
Somewhat heavier compared to other boots
1 inch tear in leather where the stiffened toe ends and laces begin after 2 years - likely due to how the dogtag I had to lace into the left one caused a weird stress point on the eyelets (holes for lacing) and toe cup.
Cost!

I wanted them the be relatively nice looking so I only had to take them out into the field once or twice, so I can't speak too much to the heavy duty wear life.  The RAT version of these boots held up very well, as I wore them during both the workups and both deployments, only having replaced the laces and insole.  They ran a bit large (normally I wear mens 9, but I should have bought 8.5) but could accommodate thicker and thinner socks with tighter or looser lacing.

Overall I recommend these if you can afford separate pairs of field boots and garrison boots."
"Great chain!!  This is the second one I ordered, one for each daughter!!  They love them!!"
"Just as pictured.  The stones appear to be pretty solid (don't look like they're going to fall out anytime soon).  Fits well, easy to wear.  Really like it!"
"I recently purchased shoes from a new balance store. So I ordered what fit me for NB. I normally don't get shoes online- difficult feet. These shoes have more cushion than the $110 pair. For me, excellent fit, cushion and comfort."
"I normally wear a 6 or 6P (small) on top. I was unsure of sizing based on other reviews so I initially ordered size medium. Nice quality vest, but too big. I ordered small and that seems just right, if a teeny tiny bit snug through the chest (34B/C) over a t-shirt but will look great open or closed and the arm holes were sized appropriately. However, the size small had some noticeable defects. I am returning and have re-ordered a new size small.

It also came with an interesting peacock necklace. Unsure if I'll wear that or pass it along to my niece for her 7th birthday :-)"
"I am rough on my bags. My office is at a power plant, and I travel constantly.  I put a lot of abuse on my bags.  I have worn out many, many, laptop bags, computer cases, and backpacks dragging them around with me to all of these locations.  I finally resorted to using a military backpack that was specially made for the US Army Rangers to use in Afganistan, that one seems to hold up, but it lacks that 'professional' look.  (professional soldier YES, but not professional desk jockey)

I had the chance to try this bag out and I must say I am impressed.  While it has not been put through the ringer for months on end yet, I can tell right away this is MUCH better than the rest of the laptop cases and computer bags I have used in the past.  It is thick and heavy, sturdy stitched, comfortable, and roomy.  This thing is great.

Starting with the laptop pocket, yes it folds out so it will supposedly be TSA legal to put through the x-ray scanner at the airport, but tell that to the TSA person who's yelling for you to take it out.  It may meet their guidelines, but just take it out anyway or you'll argue away any time you tried to save.  The pocket is padded nicely and easy to access without having to open the entire bag up.  Nice secure zipper.  Even has a smaller padded pocket inside that one to perfectly hold my iPad. Nice touch!

The remainder of the bag is great too.  Nice little pockets for odds-n-ends, and water bottle holder on the side.  The interior is roomy, more so than it seems by looking.  Once you start putting things in, it just keeps filling, its like the clown car of messenger bags.  Best part, after I crammed way too much in there, it was still comfortable to carry.

I particularly like the buckles for the flap.  Not sure if 'buckle' is the right word, but whatever you call them, I like them.  Im tired of breaking buckles or snaps, or the plastic clips.  The 'c-ring' type buckle is quick, easy, and secure.  Its a small thing, but the small things are what separate ok items from great ones.  The straps and everything else are just right, comfortable and easy to adjust.

Overall, this is just one heck of a well designed and well thought out bag.  My opinion of this is that it seems to be designed by a USER, instead of some designer somewhere trying to make what he thinks someone would want.  This screams that someone who actually uses these bags designed it, which from the info I read seems to be how this company started out.

***UDATE 12/27/12***  I spent most of 2012 traveling every week for work.  Meaning airports Monday and Friday, rental cars, and my days spent at power plants.  This is STILL my laptop bag, and it still looks great, still works perfect, and believe it or not, still doesnt even have ONE tear or popped stitch I can find.  This product is MADE TO LAST!"
"Just same as seen in the picture, lovely colors, lovely fit, looks great!! advise everbody because same with the picture."
Good heavy duty socks at a reasonable price
"I like the hat. There is only one small dent but I have no doubt it would pop out with wear as other reviewers have commented and the dent is currently unnoticeable unless carefully analyzing, I love the banding. There is no way it would shift. The ivory is what I would expect ivory to be, not bright white, not tan, but a nice off-white. I got the L/XL and it is too big for my head s I will be returning it. The inner circumference is very close to 23"". It is 100% polyester, designed in Italy, made in China."
Ordered up like other reviews said to and its awesome! So cute! Quick delivery too!
"Bought this for my son for Christmas. He hasn't put it on yet, but it will fit perfectly! The shipping was super quick too!"
"For the most part, I love this skirt.  The tiers and gathered fabric make this skirt very roomy and comfortable, even for a plus-sized gal like me.  The ""one-size waist"" does stretch quite well, but it IS rather maxed-out on me.  This advertises to fit up to a 3XL.  I would say that a 2XL would be a more ""comfortable maximum"".  I wear a 3XL, and the waist/tummy is reeeeaally hugging me, although not intolerably so."
"I wore these under my scrubs this winter, they are just thick enough to keep you warm but still allow you to wear your clothes comfortably over them."
"These are my 1st pair of Brooks, so I have no other experience with Brooks shoes to compare. By far, these have been the best running shoes I've ever had in comparison to Nike, Under Armour, Mizuno, and Reebok."
Nice quality! Wanted a the pj bottoms to be not too long and not too short and these are perfect.
My husband is very happy with it. Thanks
This fits well. The chest pocket is a little high on the shirt so it looks a bit weird but the color is rich and I feel so sexy in this. Love love love it! Will be buying in other colors!
I'm very impressed with my locket!!
Great little shoe. I wear them for work and shopping. I find them comfortable all day and they are cute which is a plus.
Really like this t-shirt and the color is as the web-site pictured it.
"This hat rocks, looks great and very well made!"
"Our son wore this every day for 2 weeks on vacation, and it held up great without any negatives.  Went through the wash fine, looks and feels of quality, and fits well."
"I have a son, he needed pants that did not have holes in the knees. Oh he is super skinny and super tall so these look like regular cut jeans on him without being high water huck finn pants, which is good because that is how he likes his jeans to look."
"I haven't used it yet, but I can put my boots in a separate compartment at the bottom."
The skirt is well made and stretchy which hugs the body better. I'm 99lbs 5'2'' and ordered a S. The bow looks great at your waist. I also got the red roses in black one but the material is not stretchy so I returned it.
"I wish the insoles did not bump the heel up so much. They are comfortable, but add a lot of unneeded lift to the foot -- and the point of these shoes for me is that they have a very low, almost flat stance."
"Comfy and warm.  Well made.  Fit perfectly,."
"so cute, but runs large. Good thing they grow fast!"
"These are for my daughter, and her second pair of them.  She loves them!"
"These are so comfortable you'll never want to take them off! They fit perfectly,keeps me warm in an Ohio winter. So pretty,sooooo soft,I love them so much that I ordered another pair the next day."
A little cheap. They seem like they don't lay right on the face.
My husband loves these shoes! Super comfy! I would buy a half size smaller though because they tend to stretch a little.
Excellent watch band! High quality
"This is beautiful!!  I wondered if is would look gaudy, but it is very tastefully made and looks elegant!"
"I have a small head and smooth hair. I have tried many headbands, and none of them worked well,especially after several uses. This one is awesome!  Next time I will get a non-sparkly one though!"
"I'll probably buy this brand again.  The fit was correct which is always the main concern when buying clothes on line.
These are as good as any I've seen in dept. stores and price was fair."
This shoes are so comfortable that you will want to wear them at your next Wedding Reception.
Adorable looks great on and made well.  Thinner material for hot summer days but not see through!
"Exactly what Mom wanted, at a lower price then around home"
"Fit is great, gives me great lift and support.
Price was low for the for the good quality."
"Fits well and is comfortable-no scratchy areas, very smooth."
"This is very cool design. It's different from usual boxer or brief, but it looks somewhat between them. It's very comfortable. I started changing all my underwear with this."
"I love this! I ordered it to wear during Pride and it was amazing!!!! Fit absolutely perfectly and had a great flair to it. I got SO many compliments! Will def order again. I'm 135lbs and 5'6"" with a very tiny waist and huge hips, it was fantastic!"
"beautiful and warm, love it."
this is an awesome ring
One of my fave shoes
VERY comfortable!!  tagless. I plan to buy more
"Got these as a gift for my 10yo niece. The looked nice and were the perfect size. I had to repackage them to gift them because they came in individual plastic bags placed in a drawstring bag- I put them in a box with cotton. I can't review how they feel in the ears or whether they caused any sensitivity- I will update if my niece has any comments or concerns. They open and close easily but securely. Overall I was very happy with the,- especially for the price."
My wife and daughter love this so much they fight over who gets to wear it.  It was bigger than I thought but if it was any smaller I don't think it would have looked nearly as good.  Any Dr. Who fan would love to get this!!!!
cute lil outfit for little girls
"Nice belt for jeans. Pretty wide, just makes it thru the loops"
"The size 7 in this shoe fit when I tried them on in a store.  At that time, I wasn't sure I wanted them, so I chose to wait and think about it.  I spotted them cheaper on Amazon (YAY!), which helped me decide to get them.  I was very disappointed when the same shoe (size AND color) I had tried on in the store DIDN'T fit when I ordered them!  I was positive, since I had tried them on in a store, that they'd be ""keepers"" for sure, but I had to return them.  This isn't the fault of Amazon or their source, its the manufacturer's quality control when it comes to sizing."
Mimi loved it! Said it was her very favorite gift she got for her birthday. She has worn it every day this week and it looks perfect. I read in another review that their's had only a sticker that read mimi. That wasn't the case for the one we received. No complaints here.

The Color is more of a teal or aqua than royal blue. I love the color though so that is not even an issue. The length is nice and the sheerness makes it light weight for spring & summer wear. The scarf offers a vibrant pop of color to any outfit and can also be worn as a shoulder wrap. The Scarf comes with a plastic zipper bag for easy storage but also protects it from dust. The bag is compact and easy to store in a purse, or in your luggage for travel. The solid color scarf can be worn in combination with another scarf in contrasting colors or designs which will leave  you looking sophisticated and feeling confident, bold & beautiful. There was not washing instructions and so I am thinking to hand washing the scarf with a delicate laundry soap will help keep your scarf clean. My oldest really loves the color and has borrowed my scarf which she has gotten a lot of compliments on how pretty it is. The Scarf is a soft, satiny material that is well made and the stitching on the side is done wonderfully to ensure your scarf lasts.
Disclaimer: I received Simplicity Women's Classic Solid Colored scarf in Royal Blue for free for the testing, reviewing purposes in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion which is formed while I was wearing the Royal Blue Simplicity Scarf. All thoughts and opinions are 100% solely all mine."
Simply the best cycling shoes I've ever owned.  I bought a pair back in 2012 and liked them so much I got these to save for a replacement when the time comes.  Awesome comfort.
"Many reviews tell buyers to go up a size, don't listen! I usually wear a small but ordered a medium initially and the top bodice was way too loose. I'm 120 lbs and a 34D and it was pretty loose. A size small fits me perfectly tight on top. Dress looks awesome with the Viana petticoat too :)"
Bought it for a gift - I think she will like it
"So far, this strap feels amazing (extremely comfortable), looks beautiful and has made me fall in love with my Orient Ray all over again. I strongly recommend this brand. Comparing it to other rubber straps, this is by far a step up. I really enjoy the vanilla smell. Will continue to get straps from them in the future if I get more dive watches. Its very strong. The buckle is a bit strange and gets some getting use to, but its very secure and that's what you want when your precious watch is in the water. I'm a lifeguard so I wear this when working.

Update: Took it to the pool, swam with it. Dries very fast, still smells like vanilla. Getting another strap today!!"
Very attractive bracelets but the band broke in less than a month.
"These fit great and were very comfortable. I ordered my normal size in Eccos.
However, the steel color was just too blah and a bit darker than I was hoping for.
I'll be returning them."
This jacket is gorgeous. It fits perfectly and I have had nothing but compliments on its appearance it is made well but no for really cold days in Maine. Its more of a fall early spring coat. I would recommend this coat to anyone.
"I love it! I initially got a medium but I exchanged it for a small since I wanted it to be fitted. It actually fits my broad shoulders! I was a bit unsure of spending $60 on a jacket but this one seems totally worth it. The thumb holes are a bit too short for me but I have long arms. Other than that, it's perfect!

Edit 12/5: A few weeks ago, one of the thumbhole stitching started to come undone. It's something I can fix, but for a $60 jacket I would hope this wouldn't happen. May just be a fluke, and I still overall recommend this jacket."
My daughter has back to back proms and these earrings go beautifully with both dresses.  They seem to be well made for the money.
I LOVE this shirt is the best of the of my life!!!!
This product went above and beyond what we expected. It was a nice quality and we were very please.
"Basic cap for what the purpose is, to block sun.  Very satisfied with the cap and would buy again. Satisfied!"
"Material is on the thinner side, work well for a cooler (but not cold) fall day."
"Perfect fit for my husband, he loves it!"
Good material don't ride up
4 stars only because I always buy a size 9 and they were too tight. I returned then and ordered a 1/2 size larger. Cut and comfy now that I have the right size.
Simply elegant
"I have some J&M light tan shoes.  The laces had worn out and I had viisited five stores looking for replacements. I found none in the right color, just browns and blacks.  I guess that the shoes are old, but they are J&Ms and those last forever.  This site had a large variety of colors and unwaxed ones, too.  The waxed ones like to come untied too easily.  I am perfectly satisfied."
The bra looks great and feels even better. Sometimes it feels like I'm not wearing any. And that's what I expect from my bra.
Good quality. Slim fitting. Not bulky. Nice feel.
"Pretty roomy and fits well under airplane seats. The wheels sometimes don't roll as smoothly as I like, but overall it works well."
Love this bra. I am full figured and chesty and never wear strapless clothing because of it but am glad to have this to wear racer back tanks. I get so hot in the summer! Hard to put on and take off.
Got wat I ordered... Looks a tad cheaper in real life
"They fit perfectly.  They were just what she needed for cold Ohio winters.  They were exactky what she wanted so that's what I bought,"
"They're really cute
And exactly like the picture. I thought I would like the oversized look but on me I didn't really like the over sized ness of the glasses even to me and my crazy style these felt kinda costume. But at the same time I can make it work with the right outfits. I'll add a pic so you can compare the oversized style with a personal pair of Lennon style glasses I bought else where that are regular siZed so y'all can see the size difference and decide for yourself if you like:)"
Used this for a color run and it was really cute and fit perfect. I even threw it in the washer and dryer after and it came out perfectly fine.
"Needed for special event and did not disappoint.
I won't be wearing them as much as other socks, but the quality seems decent enough that it was money was well spent."
Good quality slippers thanks
I lose sunglasses weekly. Needed a cheap pair that looks cute and works well. This definitely does the job. I work outside and these make life easier in the sun. Plus they look good on. No issues with them falling a part or looking cheap.
"This was a Christmas gift for a family member and they're in love with it! It's extremely soft and warm and the color is even better than in the picture online. The price is even better! All I have to say, is I wish I bought myself one!"
Shoes arrived right on time. That fit my daughter perfectly.
"I'm a scarf lover. Totally worth the money and wait to get this. It's on the thin side, but it is long enough to wrap around several times."
Finally I found a pair of jeans for a curvy women !  They cover the body with a great fit.  Love them!!
"Beautiful but remember it's for a zipper fob!  Not as big as you might expect, picture gives the clear picture but makes it appear larger.  Still, it is wonderful craftsmanship."
A little too big in toe areas
BEAUTIFUL! Fits just as expected and the material is luxurious.
Perfect shirt for St Patrick's day! Good color and fits good. The cotton makes the shirt fit good and feel good. I like this shirt and although I received this shirt at discount in exchange for my honest review I would recommend this shirt to anyone and it is worth full price.
This suit fits great. Covers up my trouble areas and looks really nice. The price is great.
My husband only wears dc shoes and likes the way they fit and uses them all the time.
"They are a little big, but I really don't mind because they fit fine and they will last longer. Love the fabric, love the super extra padding, perfect for potty training"
good quality.  soft cotton.
"Trying a new size with these. Other than the heel being a little too wide, they'll do just fine for my once in a while use. ONE note, these shoes are rather pointy which I wish they weren't for style's sake."
"Bought as a gift for my brother. Needless, to say it fit and he loved it. He's an otaku and it fits his personality perfectly."
This hat is just perfect for a dance routine my daughter is doing . It stays in her head fits great. Super cute!
"Looks nice, fits as expected. It did shrink after going through the dryer. Overall, I'm happy with the purchase.
Oh, it does show some cleavage. I was hoping to find something that would keep my chest covered while bending over to pick up my 1 year old, & keep up with my pregnant body. That may be an impossible dream."
Has nice detailing and looks nice on.
"Great high quality boys belt. I love that it is reversible. I wasn't too sure about the size and my son wears a large, but this large was too big for him. No big deal, just poked a new hole and he can grow into it!"
"very sheer, cute with tank top"
And very nice stretch. Not too tight on his feet/ankles. Good buy.
I really love these!! I got the blue and citrine!!
Disco baby
A very nice basic and made well!
Perfect detail to make a suit work for prom.
The shirt looks&fits perfect. Thank you for the fast service.
"I put these boots in my wishlist and received them for Christmas.  I love the way they look and they are able to dress up an outfit.  The metal pieces add highlights that enhance the boots without being distracting or over the top.  Very good quality and style, especially for the price.

The one complaint is they are very narrow.  I would recommend getting a half size bigger rather than the 3W to make of for the narrow fit."
"Another great sandal from otbt! Very well made, and absolutely adorable. I ordered the gold color and it's exactly as pictured, very pretty and stylish! I will continue to order the otbt brand, as they are worth the higher price.love"
Very nice watch. Excellent night visibility. Swapped the strap out for a nato and I like it even better now. It is a very large watch so it may look over sized if your wrist is on the smaller side.
traditional Carhart quality.
"Perfect fit, as usual for New Balance running shoes. I wouldn't buy these for serious running, but they are just fine for general walking and every day activities."
"I bought these for Tower Climbing for work, unfortunately they did not have a lip in the middle and were unsafe to use for climbing, but I use these things for everything else! they are warm boots if you live in a cooler climate like I do! But they are not too cold as I find them useful in spring and summer time when I want my feet protected from rugged terrain! I am very happy with these boots!"
I like these hiking boots.  I stepped in a creek and they are waterproof as long as it does not go over the ankle where the shoe ends.  We watched them bead when I pulled my foot out of the water.  The inside was not that soggy either.  Very happy with them.
"After a week of breaking these in, I can say I love them. It's the perfect sandal for doing pretty much anything in the summer. If you try them and the bother your feet give them a fair chance after a week, and you won't be sorry. They're pretty complex to adjust at first, but once you get them set, they're fast. I can hike, do yard work, and even go to work in these. I love them!"
they are flat and that is what I like the most. so the boots don't provide a very good arch...but I didn't buy them for that I bought them for wear all day....I love them.....
Perfect carry on size.  Very light weight.
DVS is one of the best shoes for all of our family great support and have a long lasting sole.
Was skeptical of low price. Was so happily surprised. Excellent quality. Perfect fit with my normal size. Beautiful
"The jumper is AWESOME!  I bought a small when I needed a medium, so I ordered the medium before I sent back the small because I needed it in time for my trip.  It fits nice and it is a nice quality material not lite, see through or cheap looking.  It is worth the money!"
I have had these exact sandals in a different color for the last several years. They fit awesome and are the most comfortable flip flops I have ever worn. Love them!!!
This costume is a must have for any perent with a baby... so cute and the material is not bad.
"What a great al around shoe for everyday use. I simply can't believe how comfortable just a plain long shoe like this can be. I applied some spray scotchgaurd waterproofing and now I'm ready for winter... Now these shoes don't have fancy insole supports and stuff but they are very comfortable, make me wonder about all those crazy expensive shoe designs, God does a pretty good job of designing feet !!  :-)"
cute~
"longish like a biker short. fit great. very stretchy, we love these ruffle butts"
Wore this for a bachelorette party. Looked just like the picture. Bangs were a little wonky. But definitely enjoyed it!
Wind wil not go thru this. Keeps you warm in very cold wind.
Runs on the smaller side but adorable! My daughter loves this dress!!
I just try this type of product for the first time and I'm impress! Looks perfect on tank tops or a dress when you don't want to the straps being showing
Excellent quality. I have washed them dozens of times and they look like new.
"Great light weight shirt. Good price, good quality.  I am 5 ft 2 200 lbs and it fits great, the perfect amount of looseness so i don't look like a sausage! Lol! Very comfortable."
Product as described.  Thank you again!  Ordered another pair
Looks just like the photo.
"Love this dress and the price. I'm normally a small to medium and I ordered a medium just to be on the safe side and to have room to grow for the next couple months. Dress fits amazing, hits right at the knee, and feel so so comfortable. I didn't want to take it off after I put it on. I double checked and asked my husband if it was see through at all in the rear end (previous issue with other dresses) and it wasn't at all! I'm definitely ordering more in different colors."
"I don't always carry a purse and been looking around for a small one so this wallet-crossbody is just the right one for me. My iPhone 6s with Speck grip case fits perfectly with extra room to slide it out. No room for keys inside though, so I just hook my keys on one of the straps and I'm good to go. One of the reasons I gave it 4 stars because it'll be easier to get your phone in and out with a magnetic lock instead of button type and it'll be a plus to have a back pocket for easy access cards. Overall, it is definitely a good buy! I'm happy with my purchase."
"The product is outstanding and the company is great to work with!  I initially ordered the wrong size by mistake and the company handled the exchange perfectly.  Couldn't be happier with how the product works.  Super easy to use and makes your collar stand up perfectly all day long.  It is simply a brilliant idea - one of those ""why didn't I think of that"".  You will not go wrong ordering this product."
"I ordered these for my 10 year old.  I was nervous that I order an adult small, but they fit perfect and the quaility was outstanding.  He says they are comfortable and he is very picky!"
"Great for boxer underwear, too thin to use as shorts."
"BEAUTIFULL, EXCELENT QUALITY"
"This runs a little big. My husband wears an 8 1/2 to 9 shoe but these tripped him up when walking. Great comfort, very nice slipper, but if your man's size runs anywhere near size 9, try the small."
Bali never disappoints and I am very happy with this bra.
Perfect. Live in NYC can't find this color in drugstores.
"I love these sunglasses! This is my third pair. They are light, very comfortable on the eyes. I have a difficult time finding good sunglasses the right size. These are perfect. I feel they are every bit as good r maybe better than more expensive brands. Good quality. My niece says they are as nice as her Oakley's that she paid $300 for. If you haven't tried this brand- give it a try. I found them in a store and tried them on, bought them on Amazon for better price."
These are ok for the sale price but not worth the regular price. Front pockets are mesh inside not cloth.
SO DANG CUTE!
fvery comfortable and fits just right
"took to jamaica for a wedding, it fits well.  I like that you can reshape it fairly well after folding it into a suitcase."
really pretty color... kind of a cranberry red!
Nice jeans at a nice price.
Bought this for my brother in law as a fun gift. He thought it was pretty fun! The quality of the hat is surprisingly good for the price. Looks good too!
"With all the OSHA related regulations out there, I finally had to start wearing flame retardant clothing. Cathartt does a good job in that catagory. So far I am happy with the fit and comfort of the pants and shirts."
This tie went well with my two stripe blue shirts
Performing fit
"Just used it for a photoshoot, wasn't expenting much but it was exactly what i needed. After the first wash it faded a bit."
"My favorite watch, love it. evrybody comments on it."
"I love it. Took about 2-3 weeks for the smell to go away, but now it's great!"
These are so cute and so comfortable you don't want to take them off.  Love them--will buy in other colors
this seems sturdy compared to the one in my watch repair kit. I crackd that during use but this feels like it was made better than my original
Our daughter wore for a school project and she loved it.
"Very comfortable and cute.  My granddaughter saw them and said ""I want some of those Granny!"""
It is an I like it.  I thought the face of it was going to be bigger.  But for the price ..I got enough...
Look great and feel really comfortable. Great value and look exactly as depicted in the advertising photograph.
"I am so happy with this purchase! Such great quality and super warm! I also love the hood, it fits snug."
"They are more like European (or 1950s US) sizes. So, where in modern US sizes I'm usually a 6, sometimes a 4, in European sizes I'm an 8 or 10. I ordered the 8 and they fit great. I wish they came in a long, they are BARELY long enough to wear with heels for me, but they are great work pants. I don't even let these look at the dryer though because I had another pair that my bf threw in the dryer and they lost about 2 inches that I desperately needed. I've had them almost 2 months now and they are holding up great."
Fits as spect to my wife
"Both lenses peeled apart after 1 year other than that Nice fit ,It says polarized on the lense and come with case ,cleaning cloth , safety cord ."
"We used these for a month of international travel, and they were wonderful. Lightweight, strong zippers, great assortment of sizes. (We bought some of the slim as well as the other regular sizes. I think this brand has the best cost to value ratio of the packing cubes available today."
"Bought for my son and he loves them! They even look better in person.  Perfect fit, and exactly as described.  Couldn't believe we got these at such a low price, they're really nice and look much more expensive.  Shipping was lightning fast, we couldn't be happier with them!"
Perfect fit for someone who wears 34A. very comfortable.
Worked perfectly!
I really like these although they are a bit narrow.
Run a lil short in my torso but fits well.
Great fabric!
"Lowa, always the best!"
Love the slippers.
Bought them for my kid and I got a hug.  They seem like great quality and look good.
I received the item and it was damaged I contacted the seller and it was immediately held and hopefully I will have this watch for chirstmas it is a very nice watch and the price was unbelievable.
"Simply lovely well made. The skulls are defined beautifully. They remind me of Cinco de Mayo. Nice length and width. The background is a soft beige bordering on a light caf. Nicely wrapped and folded. Very pleased, I live in the northeast,cold,windy. This scarf meets my needs, can be used any way you want. ROCKERS DELIGHT ENJOY"
"If you have a wide foot, keep these on for a couple hours even if they're too tight at first. I have a wide foot and was concerned when I first put these on. After a day or two walking in them they are now very comfortable."
"This fits perfectly and looks amazing. I wear it to many different occasions and always get fantastic comments. Great for weddings, summer events, and anywhere where you need a white dress. Excellent"
I bought this jacket for my grandson and he absolutely loves it!  It's a nice looking jacket and also nicely made.
Super sexy!  It arrive sooner than the due date. I can't wait to show it off. True to size.
Bought this cause it looked great. Fits good only thing is that when you try hook it it keeps coming back out.
"I love these jeans. They have a bit more stretch than the denim version but they are great jeans! I wear a sz. 10-12 in regular jeans so I buy the sz. 10 in Jag because I like them a bit snug and they do stretch a bit as you wear them. I love the softness of the fabric in these particular pans, the color is darker than a tan but that's okay with me, and the length is generous (I'm 5'6""). I can wear them with flats as well as with heels (which I rarely do anymore). Beautifully designed, excellent quality. I will only be wearing Jag jeans from now on!"
Have to wash/dry twice then they will fit you as expected.
Absolutely adorable! And the price for so many onesies is awesome! Can't wait for it to be warmer so my little guy can wear these!
"These hats are extremely well made, and of high quality material. They are one of the greatest bargains that I have ever found!"
"I got this outfit and the matching blanket as a gift for a friend, The set seems to be of good quality and is very cute. My friend loved it!"
"These are my go to footwear around the house. I might also use them outside, they are certainly comfortable enough. They thing I don't like are the buckles. But the sandals are really comfortable and seem to exercise your feet as you wear them.

I would recommend them."
"love my new shoes, they fit great & look good!"
Fit great!  Really long opening
"Beautiful watch. Substantial and striking. Haven't had it long enough to speak for performance, but I look forward to a long time of wearing it."
Awesome Fit. Great for workout
So dainty!! Love this necklace!
Bought this watch for my husband and he totally loved it. Looks great
I wear a 9 but like to wear thick socks with boots so I bought the 9.5.  Love it.  Fits great.  Comfortable for the heal height.  Very soft but durable.  Can't beat the price.
It fit well. The material feels fine and looks really nice.
"I loved the idea of these.  I wear a size 7 normally, and a large fit me well.  I thought they seemed comfortable when I tried them on and I could fit my passport in the zipper, although it was tight.  I didn't end up keeping them, however, because they are particularly high waisted.  I had already purchased quick-dry pants for our trip and these stuck out of the top of the pants big time.  To me, it seemed to defeat the purpose of hiding anything if they stick out of your outerwear.  On the other hand, there isn't much way around that if the pouch is to be big enough for a passport . . . If you plan to wear these with very high waisted pants or dresses they would be a good buy.  They are certainly an excellent idea in theory!  The seller was prompt with my refund (although be warned you will have to pay the return shipping)."
Dont like the pads but overall its a really nice swimsuit
"I fell in love with a pair of these socks at a tiny shop in Big Sur.  I just had to have them, had never seen anything remotely like them.  The colors are so pretty, and the mismatch is the best part.  Once I got home, I found them online and have bought more pairs, both the crew and the shorter ones.  They fit and wash beautifully, are holding up to wear, and just make me happy.  I love that they are all cotton also.  I have also bought some as gifts, which made the recipients very happy as well.  I highly recommend these high quality/beaut/comfort socks."
"Slippers are great, but the quality is less than desired. This is my third pair and I find the need to replace every year due to ripping that occurs from use. That's why I'm giving it only 4 stars."
Wow lots of rings!!!!
This is actually my second pair of these shoes (I got the first at DSW and I still wear those too) and they're amazing. I'm always telling people that they're like walking on clouds. I don't notice any foot problems when I'm wearing these and I'm always comfortable at work. I'm on my feet all the time (retail) and these shoes were the best investment I made toward comfort in the workplace. I absolutely recommend these if you're in the market for taking care of your feet.
"This is my third pair of these, as I wore the others into the ground. They fit well, provide good arch support, and are very comfortable. I did notice that the second pair wore out much more quickly than the first. Hopefully that's not a sign that quality is going down in these sandals."
I bought this for a bridal shower and the girl is very small on top...have not heard any complaints...would def purchase again from this supplier...
Great pjs. Comfy
"These just arrived, so I haven't worn them outside the house yet.  But, they fit well!  I wear between a 7-8 US and by default go with a 7.5, but since this didn't have 1/2 sizes, I decided to get a 7.  I am glad I did, as the fit is good and there is plenty of room between the ends of my toes and the end of the shoe.  An 8 would have been WAY too big!  Size printed on the bottom and inside of the zipper says 5- maybe this is the UK size?
I am 5'3"" an active person and dance and exercise regularly and have normal size calves for an active person and these fit just fine around the calf.  If you have larger than average calves, you may find them tight.
I paid extra for expedited shipping, which was expensive, but they got here quick!  I did not want to wait 6 weeks for the normal shipping.

They are cute and I can't wait to wear them out on the town!  Hopefully the quality holds up."
"They are a little stiff and will take a while to break in so I can wear them comfortably without socks, but I expected this.  I did go to a store to try sizes before buying online.  I wear an 8.5 and the Size 38 fit perfectly.  They are a little wide in the heel, but if this is a problem, I can add a heel pad to fix that.  Love the crazy colors!!!  These are going to be so much fun to wear this spring and summer!"
The most comfortable boots I ever had on my feet.
Useful in FL
Its ugly so you cant loose it. It could go around your neck with a paracord. You could hold coins and US dollars. Very cool.
I love these shoes they are comfy and cute. I would highly recommend them. They fit true to size with regular socks.
"I bought two scarves, one for me and one as a gift. They are a wonderful soft material and the zipper pouch is well hidden. It will accommodate a small cell phone like an iPhone, or a small wallet/credit card holder. I liked it so much I bought another one for a gift. Perfect for when you don't want to carry a purse and just need to take one or two items along"
"Not huge fan of pointed toe, makes my foot look longer, but very comfortable shoes. So, not perfect, but couldn't find anything better."
Very pleased with quality and color
"The calfs are super tight, but they are really cute boots."
"Great deal for the price. The belts appear to be relatively sturdy, as well as identical to a belt being sold on another website for nearly three times the price (just for one, not for two colors)! I have not experienced the issue of the belt popping off while being worn, but I also haven't worn it for an entire day yet."
Quirky and cute
"This slip is very fitted. Im a true size 4, and this was tight."
"I love the boots but I'm amazed they fit large on me. If you're looking into buying, I suggest a size or half size smaller than your regular shoe size."
Great looking jacket fit me just right
"Finally! Shoes I can walk in :) I got the natural patent in 5 1/2. They are nice quality, fit true to size, have textured rubber soles for no slipping! Love these."
"These are great socks! Sturdy and warm, but not scratchy. Approve!"
Bought them as a gift
Nice good fit
Bought this for the Mrs.  The fit was great and she looked great in it.  Could not be happier with the purchase.
Very delicate and unique!
Super soft and comfy to wear
"Great dress, stretchy fabric, but chest was too small for my large bust.  Everything else fit fine.  I'm 5'7"" 165 lbs size 34G bosom."
These boots are super easy to put on and cute for keeping toes warm around the house or going out.  They fit my daughter perfectly but she is small for her age.  Consider ordering a size larger.
Fun SHIRT!
"Great 5-ring Zulu strap! The material feels strong and the blasted metal rings look great. It will soon be going on a watch with the same finish. The color is a slightly dark tan that looks great. So far, I can't think of one thing wrong with it. It even came with a spring bar tool and pins."
"Thank you Sketchers, once again. My son (who is 14) has size 16 wide feet and these are the only shoes that fit and that are affordable!!"
"I have a few of these now- they are pretty warm (wool and/or fleece is probably a little warmer) and do the trick, plus they're a good price point."
This product really worked to remove toe marks on my Toms!
"Love these - they're a nice winter-weight sock that I've worn with boots a couple of times and have received compliments on them. The little ruffle at the top is very cute, my hubby says it's 'sexy'. :-)"
Great fitting and comfortable ...
"The ring is beautiful with lots of sparkle and a bargain of a price for what it is. It's about 4 mm across where the stones are and about 3 mm wide for the band. The prongs on the smaller side stones were a little sharp, but clear nail polish took care of that problem easily. If you're looking for bling at an affordable price, this ring won't disappoint."
Wearing them now!  Perfect for all the snow we've gotten this year.  Warm. Plenty of tread Lots of compliments.  Only downside is no zipper
"These little pants are plenty long enough, but I was worried that they would be too tight in the waist since he is a little chunky (25lbs @ 9 mos, breast fed). The elastic is narrow & not to strong ( tightly woven) so elastic is quite forgiving, enough to get him through the winter in NC mtns. He looks adorable in them! ( of course!) The material is cotton, soft, not too thick, but enough to keep his little chunky legs warm"
Quite big. My little one loved it. It fits  books nicely and the pockests are great for nicknacks and other stuff. Great material easy to clean.
thebelt is a little hard
"Good fit. I do wish they had tread on the soles, but they are fine. Alittle tough to pull on as they are narrow and tall, but they work. This is my second pair and they are great for the money."
These heels have held up very well. I wore them to work a lot while I was in sales. I found them comfortable and durable.
Did not expect less from Fruit of the Loom.
A bit see through but overall very cute.
"Aside from the fact that my 5'9'' height is almost too short for these suspenders, they do exactly what I want them to do without any discomfort around the armpits.  The clips require a little bit of effort to unlatch."
Fabulous quality.  Wonderful feel.  Super warm.  Great colors.  Very pleased!
"Best slippers I've ever had.  They're gigantic, but really warm and comfortable."
"This is the second batch of capris I have bought in this brand and for some reason this new purchase is a bit more snug than the last. I like it, its thick material and fits snuggly."
Husband loves them but belt loop always come off.
"These saved my feet during a move. We have hardwoods and tiles throughout our home and during our last move, I wore these as I moved our stuff up 3 flights of stairs and packing everything up. I know they work as I wore them out during that time as they permanently compressed in foot-bed, but the sole held up.

For normal wearing around these are great and will last a lot longer than the abuse I put them through. Give you feet some support and buy these."
Awesome pants but a better price!!!
These Papi's are great. They are comfortable and I recommend them to others.
"This ring is small, dainty, and perfect for pairing with a stunning engagement ring. I have a halo sapphire engagement ring, and this wedding band is absolutely perfect and matches the halo diamonds!"
"A few years ago I bought the 'better clog bootie' - and just love it.  I have looked at the better clog line ever since (but they are expensive)  So when I saw this shoe at this (greatly) reduced price - I ordered it.  Generally I wear an 8 (even sometimes a 7.5) - in this I wanted/needed the 8.5 (as I did with the better clog bootie).  Could have kept the 8 - but want to be able to have a mid-weight sock.  Anyway - love, love the better clog smooth.  Love the sable brown."
My husband likes them for comfort and warmth. He said they fit perfect. He's talking about buying more.
Got this for my husbands 50th birthday and he loved it.  It's true to size and very comfy.
Purchased this scarf for a friend who is a owl lover.  Nice scarf.  I know she will like it.  Not thick.  Lightweight.  Thank  you.
"Cute! Fits perfect, although I could have gotten a medium and been fine!"
Gave as a gift to my wife.  She loves it.  Soft material.
Love that it's quality canvas & plenty of room! Nice leather trim!! A must have bag if you're into this type!
Bought these for my mom and she loves them. It's her second pair. She has arthritis and she says they help her.
"These are definitely stretchy in the legs but the waist is not so stretchy. A 33 should be about a size 16, but there is no room in the waist. It gives me a slight muffin top and the waist cuts in after a while. If these are like other Levi's I have, washing and not drying will help a little., but just know these might be a little tight.

The fabric is excellent and the jeans are well made. These jeans will last you a long time."
i needed boots  to wear to a wedding.  I saw this and decided to gamble and purchase it.  I knew I could return it if it did not meet my expectations.  It was inexpensive for a boot. Wow!  What a surprise when it arrived.  It is perfect for the dress I am going to wear. Perfect fit and beautiful.
Finally I got a pair that is actually the right size as advertised.  I've ordered at least 3 other pairs and too big
This is just awesome!  It is plastic and lightweight and lights up so neatly.  It goes on when touched and changes color.  It ships in two pieces that you put together.  My son actually loves it as a staph.
"Dearfoam slippers, I love the brand and how comfortable they are :)"
They are the greatest and stay up.
"I adore this dress.  Perfect length, perfect fit, doesn't look baggy, sleeves are slightly long but that isn't an issue because I commonly roll sleeves because I like the look and bracelets show. I love the green and taupe colors. I used  spray wrinkle remover ( my favorite thing to ""iron"" with) and it worked beautifully to remove the packing wrinkles.
Now if you wonder about sizing, and I know sizes can run differently) I would order your usual size. I am 5'4"", 142 pounds, bra size 36D. I ordered a size 10 and this dress is an absolute perfect fit. I love the colors because they are perfect for year round....paired with a sandal for summer or boots for winter. It is a style that can be dressed up with heels or worn more casually.  The dress was already wonderfully priced, but with some points from my Amazon credit card I really  scored for three bucks. Just love it!"
"These pants are super lightweight and comfortable. They're slightly see-through, but that's forgivable since they're pajama pants. I ordered a size up because it's been my experience in the past that Calvin Klein dresses run a little small. Apparently that doesn't also apply to their pajamas, because these are definitely larger than I was expecting."
"My grand daughter already had a pair that fit great on her wide foot, so I bought the next size for her to grow into."
"So comfortable, feels like your walking okn clouds.. absolutely love these shoes."
Just to tight.
"i loved them, very fast shipping....but I had to send back and get a refund because they were to small and you did not have a bigger size.....  I have not received a credit yet we will see how that goes."
"This is the cutest suit! It is super comfy to wear! It fits great. it is made of great material. the bottom of the top doesn't ride up, i was really surprised. I'm loving this suit. I have worn it the last 3 or 4 times we went out on our boat. It came in very fast! I have fell in love with this suit. i will have to update on what size i bought, but it fits perfectly.

i did receive this suit at a discount to leave an honest review, and my oldest daughter loves this suit as much as i do! so it looks like i will be reordering it..giggle"
Love the way the dress look on me. I have black and white just like it.
Thicker quality panties that fit my four year old great.
I love the sweater.  Soft feel and great drape.  Love the sleeves.  Service was quick.
So cute!  More space than I expected. My 3.5 year old loves it & is able to roll it by himself!
I lived in these when I was nursing.  Love them.
Love . Do not irratate my ears or daughters at all..
This dress is my daughter's  New Years dress... I'm really pleased with it. Thanks
I like that the shirt was nice but it was too large
"It fits well and seems very expensive, but the price is acceptable. I think it's for taller person, but for me it also good."
Gave this as a gift to a co-worker -- she loved it! Very versatile and easy to wear.
Awesome shoes will definitely buy  my shoes from there when I need them  thanx  so much
I love that shoes it is very beautiful and it's sexy and I think it fits perfect just buy your size.
"I like the fit of this top, and it's very cute on! However, the material is thinner than I would have liked for the price. I plan to be careful when washing this item."
Nicely tailored.
My daughter couldn't pass these up for mommy.
"I love Sketchers, and these are definitely good shoes.  I wouldn't recommend using them athletically, but they're a great casual shoe.  The shoe itself is somewhat narrow, but the most narrow part is the sole of the shoe (underneath).  It's not at all like a tennis shoe, as the imprint of the sole is about the size of my foot itself.  Most tennis shoes have a sole that is larger than the shoe, but again these are very narrow.  Not a bad thing for a casual shoe, but not to be use for running/exercise."
"These are great pants, good fit, second time I've gotten this type.  Without the front pockets, it seems the pant fits better"
"These are great glasses, comfortable, with clear glass and look exceptionally great on anyone!!  I would recommend them to a friend!!"
It is nice that I don't have to search all over town for a Plus Size bra.  Price is reasonable.  Will be ordering this again
Not sure if I was expecting them to be huge or what but I thought they looked small. Haven't used them yet as our little one hasn't arrived. Otherwise material is perfect and lightweight!
As expected perfect !!
sorry i bought these for a cruise  haven't worn them yet but the color is awesome
"I had a problem with my first set of glasses.  Joopin refunded my money and then sent me a great pair of replacements.  Fit great, nice round lenses, perfect for driving in bright sunshine."
I love these boots - they're exactly what I've been looking for.  They fit perfectly; they're very comfortable & attractive.  I especially like the zipper opening - it makes them so much easier to slip on.
Great socks. I'll order more as the dryer eats one of a pair.
"My body measurement is bust 37 inches, waist 29 inches, 56, 155lbs. I bought the zip grey cardigan on grey color on size US 10. I think the zip blazer is made with cotton material, its not structure but its soft and comfortable. The packaging is properly made and also I love the material of this product where it is very comfortable and its good for daily casual style. Usually I have problems with the arm hole with other jackets, but for this grey jacket, since the material is stretchy, no problems at all in arm area and I can move my arms easily. The product fit very nicely and the side zipper also works well. This grey jacket looks good with casual style such as jeans and even shorts. Overall its a great deal."
Went well with my shoes but three of the rhinestones fell off.
"Love these sneakers -- light, comfortable, fit well (I'm 9.5)"
"Napoleon has a cameo appearance in our theatre production and I opted for the Elope Napoleon Hat over cheaper alternatives, and I'm very glad I did. The hat is substantial, not flimsy, and is generously sized to fit an adult's head. Too often I've purchased cheap costume hats and found them to be too small to be useful.

The hat is actually a tricorne turned around, not the traditional Napoleon bicorn, but I see that as a plus. If needed, it can be turned around and used for George Washington or a British Naval Officer or the like."
"Due to breast cancer and reconstruction, underwire support impossible to wear.  This wireless works well and is comfortable. I will be ordering another.  Only drawback, and no way around it, in the heat of the day with 90+ temperatures, the foam gets pretty hot.  But, holds its shape and washes beautifully."
"Very cute for a little boy who wanted ""Cowboots"" like grandpa. Not bad for the price."
Absolutely love hem.have worn them everyday.
Seamless zipper in the back is great!.  Looks exactly as the picture.  Good buy!
Are real converses and they fit perfectly! great deal
"Comfy and beautiful. This isn't a winter coat, it's very thin. It's good for when you get a little chilly around the house."
"Perfect! I'm 5'7"" and I wear a small. I bought a small in this and it fits me just like in the photo -- a little oversized. I love it -- and the price is so right."
Sweet ring with lots of bling!!..lots of compliments!  Sweet ring for the price!
Cool & earthy burlap... looks nice but does leave little burlap shred on basically everything. Note to self: avoid wearing black when toting :-/
"Love the wallet, bought this one but was damaged so returned it and got the same one in black.  Great easy to carry size. Lots of card storage. Love it!"
Love this bathing suit and the color is beautiful. Fit as expected. My normal size in everything.
I have been buying this bra for over 4 years now.
"love my crocs shoes, comfy fits perfect and feels very light!!"
"I have had a TON of compliments on my boots! Not only do I love them, but so many others do too! They are cute, comfortable, have the arch support I need. I can't wear them for too many hours due to a plate in my foot, but I could see others being able to get all day wear just fine! Great lil boots."
"As soon as the sandals arrived I was anxious about how they would fit.  My foot is wide in the fore front and narrow at the heel so most strappy sandals don't work for me, but these do and I'm very pleased with how they love on my foot.  The taupe is a good ""nude"" color for me as I rarely tan.  They are also very comfortable and soft.  Thank you to the other reviewers that gave details about the fit."
Great suit!  I'm really happy with my purchase.
"These are my favorite pj's for my kids! Soft, stretchy and so comfy. I will not buy any other brand again. Great quality."
"My daughter and I are wearing somewhat matching costumes.  With so Many adult costumes showing way more skin than is appropriate when trying to match an 8 year old this fits the bill.  The fabric is substantial and not  ""halloween costume like"".  I will just have to be careful when washing and drying as all the bones are heat appliques.  Like another review I would say order AT LEAST one size larger than you think.  I probably should have ordered two sizes larger.  I am 5'3"" and these come about 4"" above my ankles.  Glad I ordered skeleton socks.  Hopefully my arm warmers will come in with plenty of time."
Very cute and comfortable. I wore them all day and my feet didn't hurt.
Better than I expected... made a cute lilo and stitch costume
"These are good flats once they are broken in, but the first time my daughter wore them she got blisters on both feet."
Nice backpack!  Sturdy and holds toys well and makes a great toddler diaper bag. It has Everest and Skye on it which pleases my toddler. Her brother wishes the boy versions had them as well.  He's five and questions the sexist separation of these two characters from all the other pups on products.
"I purchased this Incantasia the Glamour Witch costume for my 6.5 year-old and she loves it! I was looking for a good quality witch's dress because I wasn't impressed by the witch's costumes sold at some of the local retailers (the material was too flimsy, barely held up, and looked really cheap).

In contrast, this Incantasia costume not only looks beautiful but feels luxurious too. The material is soft and the purple inner lining is a great touch, not only aesthetically but also to provide some form of insulation. After all, by the time Halloween comes around, the weather might get a tad cold. The dress also has an attached belt which can be adjusted with a beautiful jewel brooch in the middle. The witch's hat also feels sturdier than most of the witch's hats I've seen at local retailers. It fit my daughter's head perfectly and is made in such a way as to be able to accommodate larger heads (since it states the size is for 6-8).

My daughter is about 50 lbs, and is about 46 inches tall and this dress fit her quite well, except for the collar which was a bit loose and there was a little room in the waist too. This is one of the most beautiful, well-made Halloween costumes we've purchased, and I'll definitely be checking out the manufacturer's other costumes for next Halloween!"
"It is rather wide, but it is the most comfortable ring I have ever worn.  It will show scratch marks.  Very pleased with the price and quality of this ring."
Really great boots.  Fully lined and they look great.  Vender shipped quickly.  Highly recommend at this great price.  These are some of the best western zipper boots available.
I have a lot of Saddleback products and like this one very much.  It is what it says it is with all of the SB quality you expect.  Thick leather but it still has the right size to fit slacks and not just jeans.  I have their thicker belt as well.  Love them both.
"Love this jacket! The color and fit are just as expected.  The roll-up hoodie feature is especially useful, and the entire jacket is light enough that I can fold it up into a small space to carry in a bag or backpack. I have other rain jackets but this one repels the water more efficiently and I can easily layer it over a sweater or long-sleeve shirt if it is cold outside."
These have quickly become my favorite sneakers.
Love these shoes. I'm on my feet all day. They are great.
"Nice blue color, and has such an awesome lift!! The legs fit tight but it looks good that way. These give an amazing round shape, i really love it."
"I'm still figuring out how I feel about these shoes. For starters, I cannot deny that when I put them on, they have a lot of support for a flip flop. Now this could be because I have a high arch, but I feel as if the arch part is up higher in the shoe, more below the pad below my big toe as opposed to an inch lower in the middle of my foot. Sorry, I don't know the proper foot ""parts"". However, I thought this could be how they are designed so they are more comfortable? I have a skinny foot and wear a size 7. I bought the size 7 and they looked HUGE on my feet. So I bought the size 6 and they fit better but seem a little too small in the length of my foot. I kept the size 6 so I didn't look like I was wearing my dads shoes. The part where the toes goes though is still pretty big but again, I have skinny feet and wide shoes look huge on my feet. I could really use the half size in this shoe so if anyone from the OOFOS reads this, half sizes would be great in these. I'm retracing 1 star just for the odd fit. I'm hoping this type of construction is intentional and is good for my foot. I almost feel that the arch part is making the top part of my foot arch over a bump and that leaves my arch not supported but perhaps it's giving me better support? I know that I can stand in these for a long time without my feet hurting so I think they are working."
"I like the fit. Most stores offer one size fits all, which doesn't ever work for me. I also love the longer length of this glove and the soft lining as well."
As expected for a military item
Gift for daughter; she loved it.
"I got my package from Rosme yesterday, about a week ahead of schedule.  I'm very pleased with this bodysuit, which fits as expected - that is, very similarly to my Bali Lace & Smooth bodysuits.  I'd characterize the control as ""medium"" - comparable to the Bali, or possibly even a little bit more firm.  I have a reaalllly long back, and so with any new brand or style, there's always the question of ""will it fit""; but this has plenty of length. Super pretty, too, excellent quality for the price. Very very likely to buy another!"
"This is a beautiful suite. I bought a large and it fits perfect. I wear a 34B and 6/8 bottom usually. I def have junk in the trunk and wider hips from having 2 kids. The top stays up even when being active like playing frisbee. The colors are just as shown. I wish I could have tried a medium top to see if it fits a little better in the cups, but that's my preference."
decent wool socks for the price.  I like.
Very warm and versatile.
Fits perfect and looks elegant but is so comfy.
"Great quality, thick knit material that is well made. My husband is 5'10"" and 160 lbs and it was a little long in the sleeves and a little big around. Not huge, but roomy which is good if you are wearing over another shirt."
"Great dress! Cute, comfy and fun!"
Beautiful dress.. Small around the chest area.
Good looking shirt. Ordered a medium which is what I normally wear and it fit perfectly.
"Caution, the shirt is tapered and runs on the small side. Great looking shirt otherwise."
"I usually wear a size 8 in ASICS, but this model I needed an 8.5. I love my new shoes -- so comfortable, they did not need any ""breaking in"" time!"
"Very cute, snags easily."
"Looks to be classic Kamik quality boots, but the boot and liner are tight on this one.  Usually have room for winter socks in my Kamik size 11 boots, but this will likely only be comfortable with a thin layer of socks.  Will keep them, as they may be more useful as summer boots now."
Super comfortable and nice to have a rubber sole. A major hit during cold weather!
Stretches so fit is not an issue
"T-shirt is awesome, but too small"
Great fit. Long tail.
Love these clogs! My second pair of Klogs. Wish they lasted longer. They are incredibly comfortable!
"I was looking for a cozy jacket that could repel snow and light rain.  This is perfect.  It is well made, and washes great.  I took off one star because the sleeves are not as waterproof."
"This was the perfect way to carry my passport and money when I travelled to Europe. It was very light weight and secure and you could not even tell I had it on which was great to keep thieves away. Another great bonus is that if you love to take pictures, just like me, you won't be able to tell you something underneath your clothing which believe me it's something I hadn't thought about in my first trip abroad and later regretted. One my first trip to Italy I had bought a neck stash and you could tell I had a bulge underneath my shirt and when I saw my pics it looked like I had a hernia (not good),so when I went back I bought this stash and it was a great option. I would definitely recommend this if you want to travel safely and come out good in your pictures."
This product is awesome. Lightweight fabric and tasteful in all occasions an very fashion very good for all clothes .
"Love these boots! Awesome quality, I got the taupe ones and was afraid from the other review photos that they'd not be as dark brown as the item pic. They match the item photo exactly and are a nice darker brown color."
Teen daughter very happy with her snow boots
"Socks! Who doesn't love a man in a good pair of socks? These are a great quality sock for a reasonable price. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a ""fun"" quality sock."
"Great underwear. Fabric is amazing, soft and comfortable."
"I do really like this dress.  It's comfortable and really what I was looking for, for an upcoming work trip.  The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is it seems a bit cheap. I know I didn't pay a lot for it, so I'm not complaining.  Just the fabric at the top is folded, but unfinished. I would assume I won't get more than a few uses out of it.  Very Cute though! And flattering!"
I could not find this item in any stores; so checked Amazon and there it was. I had been searching a long time and was very happy to find the exact one I wan't.  The color is perfect; not too bold or bright.  The leather is fantastic quality and the price was really excellent.  A Christmas gift to myself.  Love it so much I may order another one in a different color.
"This dress is perfect. It fit as expected. Although the packaging sucks, but no big deal just put it on a clothes hanger and hang it on the shower curtain. Turn the HOT water on and close the bathroom door let it run about 30 then turn off the water off. Let them hang in the bathroom for at least another 30 minutes. Now take it out side and hang it up. Let it dry. Now just fluff the ruffles and is good to go. I apsolutly love this dress. Oh and one more thing, it is a 2 piece outfit."
"Love, Love, Love these earrings.  I have three holes in one ear and two on the other.  I used the three middle sized hoops and I just love them.  They are difficult to put on but it's worth it!!  I sleep in these and have had no problems at all."
"This parasol is very well made and is more beautiful in reality than the picture would indicate. It's the perfect accessory for a sunny day. I got this one for myself but now that I see the quality, I shall be ordering more for friends and family - Christmas is coming!"
I had purchased these last year for my daughters for Christmas (4 girls ages 3-11). They are unable to wear anything that isn't gold or silver but too irresponsible for something too expensive. These earring look gorgeous and they don't irritate their ears and the best thing is if they lose one they are economically easy to replace.
"Fits a little snug, but still amazing. I love the loose bottom and get endless compliments on this simple piece"
"Love this blouse! Super super soft! Hangs very nicely, even on a large person. I bought 3X and weight 260 lbs with 44 E bra. Love this shirt!!!!"
"Needed to get adjusted with my massage sandals when I first got them, but kids don't seem to have a problem
at all. All my grandkids own a pair, they love the sandals
Had to change a couple, one was wrong color and the other a Big Kid vs men's although same size, was slightly different"
"Love, just love it!"
WEAR THEM CONSTANTLY FOR WLAKING
Wonderful super beautiful and comfortable boots.
"These are for our 6-year old grandson. He had a pair of Quiksilver flop flops last summer and loved them. These are just as great as the last pair he had. I would give these the ""cool flip flops"" award! The pair from last year are still in great shape and we have passed them on to another grandchild. Excellent product."
Fits a little bit more snug than my husbands other shirts this size but stretches out just fine. The graphics are well done. I would but again.
"I use the sports bras, of course for working out and they do what they're suppose to do, hold them in place, my 2 girls absolutely love them (LOL)"
"I really like these. They sit right on top of my glasses. You can only see my glasses if you're looking close enough. I do notice when looking at my phone a polarized glare, because they're polarized. So take note if you don't like that. Nice thick sides with a little pattern on them. Sturdy!"
I really like these shoes.  They are stylish and fit well right out of the box.  Style may be a little too casual for every day wear but for casual Friday and weekends they are perfect.  I've owned several pair of Merrell shoes and they are always excellent quality.  I like these best.
Bought for my brother.  Keeps his face warm in winter when he's doing outside inventory at work.
Non better these trousers fit well nice jeans.
"so cute, not real stretchy, but that is good for us."
Super cute I love them fit great except the straps are very loose and do not even touch my feet.
"My granddaughter and her parents adore her pumas.  She has good balance when she walks, run or jumps!"
"I get so many compliments on this!  this is actually my second person of the style. a very dear friend of mine fell in love with the first one I had so I gave it to her. I have the style in pink which is very nice for summer. very roomy interior, but I wish the the handles were more generous in length."
"Stepson requested these, bought him some last year, the family was stealing his supply"
"This is the first time that I've purchased shoes via the internet.  However, I have purchased a number of pairs of Nunn Bush loafers over the years, and their fit and durability has proven to be consistent, so I decided to give it a try.  No surprises.  I am very satisfied with the shoes, and they arrived promptly."
The material is alright .
"I couldn't resist, being half Italian, checking out this brand. I'm happy to say my partial ancestry didn't let me down. This stuff glides on smooth, smells great, and gives me a clean shave, without nicks, every time. Highly recommended."
"I have been wearing this purse for a few days now and I love it! I got this bag in the color olive. It is a nice medium size bag, kind of bigger than it appear in the photo but not too big. It also did not have that unpleasant smell that most PU leather has. I like that it zip close at the top and it has many zipper pocket to store my loose change, lip gloss, and things like that. I am super happy with the quality and craftsmanship. It has plenty of room to hold my wallet, kindle fire HDX 7, cell phone, a small notebook, and more. My only issue was that the inside seam of middle zipper area was coming apart when it arrived. But other than that I have no complaints whatsoever."
Great little baby socks!
Very cool bootie.
"I need to wear steel toed boots at work, and these boots are pretty comfortable! I wear them anywhere from 8-12 hours a day. So far ive had them for about a month and so far no issues what so ever."
"High quality product and nice packaging, good value at the price point and with Prime no shipping. 2.5"" sizing fits all of my shirts and they're inexpensive enough that if I accidentally send a shirt to the cleaners with a pair in there, no big deal."
"Cute little bag for the money! The bag is fabric with suede fringe strips sewn on.
 Look great with everything and is light weight... I will buy again when I either wear this one out or manage to break it."
"I ordered this in the blue from another site and it is just perfect! I got the small but it's very stretchy and I am short... I'm 5'4"", however... I am what they call thick (140lbs 34.27.42) and very curvy (wish I could post a pic of me in the outfit for reference)and the small still fits just fine. With a jumpsuit like this you want the fit to be conforming but comfortable, I would say it fits a little big though, usually I wear a medium and the small was perfect. You don't have to worry about underwear showing, the side mesh doesn't go too low. I really have nothing bad to say about this outfit, it's definitely an attention, show stopping jumpsuit and at a great price!"
"You can't beat this many socks for the price. I find them comfortable, have worn some pairs twice already and so far no issues. Would recommend them to guys who are like me and change out sock/boxers and vest often.
Only draw back is that I wish there were a few more grays and browns than the one pair each. Can't fault them though cause the picture was clear on the quantity of each."
excellent! Levi's it's the best!
Exactly like my last wallet - super! Enjoying it.
just what I needed and wanted! I recommend this :) I am using it for a cupcake costume its great! :)
Good bracelet well made and quality clasps. Most corrode or rust after prolonged wear but nice materials.
"Love these shirts have 5 of them.  They look great, no wrinkles and hold up well."
"Update: our son STILL loves this, 18+ months later. Its pretty snug on him now but he still sleeps in it, plays the grizzly when our boys play hunting. I would do this every year if I could.

We got this for our five year old son for Halloween, he wore it the week leading up to Halloween, and has worn it around the house and as pj's multiple times since. I bought it a little big anticipating that he would be able to wear it for a while. He's a lover of all things cozy and soft. The jammie's themselves seem to be well made and don't fuzz all over everything in the wash. Overall, it was a good buy. I would do it again."
"I'm not a huge fan of the color of these. I wanted a brown flip flop and these are a little more of a tanish brown. I'd prefer dark, but overall they are good. They meet my expectations as any other Teva would. Teva's in general are very comfortable and these do not disappoint. They also have some mild arch support, which is necessary for me as I have flat feet. I wear a 9 1/2 in shoes and the 10 fit perfectly. I did not find the straps too loose. The leather look makes them dressier looking than my normal Teva's even though they are a casual flip flop, which is nice. I have not used them yet for any long distance walking but everyday walking has not been a problem."
This was a gift for my boyfriend. It's one of his favorite t-shirts (he's canadian of course). The quality is good and it fits well.
"got these in size 10. they are true to size and look far better than the pictures. though the heels are high, but i do not really have issues with that. really love the shoes and at the price I bought it , it was a really good deal. its a must buy."
this was bought for my grandson who lives in the cold north-he loves it and is being put into use almost daily with the cold weather where he lives.
"Nothing fancy, but they're comfortable and padded without weighing too much."
Good style and low price.  What's not to like.  I will buy again.
Great wife likes them
"I am a huge fan of Stride Rite shoes. We got many pairs of shoe from them for my daughter over the years, and now we have been getting them for my son and have continued to be impressed. My children have feet that are wide, like mine, so for our hobbit-selves these are great. These particular shoes are replacing another pair of similar shoes. My 2-year-old son has been comfortable moving in these, he hikes, and runs comfortably. The shoes seem to be made so that they are warm, but they still breathe well, and aren't too heavy. When he outgrows these I will keep buying him similar shoes."
"Very pretty, diamond is actually a bit bigger than I expected and it sparkles tremendously. I've had many compliments on it."
"I normally wear a size 9, these run small and the 10's I ordered fit perfect! Just enough room for a gel insole, which makes them comfortable enough to wear all day."
Returned my 6.5 for a 6 and they are so cute
shirt fits great bought it for my sons birthday
I really like the fit of these
"A bit thin, but good otherwise."
"Love them!  Super soft, stretchy, comfy."
"Love them, just wish they were bigger!  Great choice of sizes!"
"I bought some steel double flared tunnels from another seller, and the flared ends were waaaaay too big.

The flare on these is just big enough to slip in easily, without being so extreme that you need to size up just to get them in.

The center of the tunnel is 12.13mm, the outer flare is 13.57mm. They don't irritate my ears. I've bought about 8 pairs of plugs from Mystic Metals, and the fit is always great. The color is always off, but once you know what to expect, it's good to have an old reliable to keep coming back to, since there is such a large variance in jewelry sizing it seems like"
Got rave reviews for these when I wore them. My friends wanted to know where I bought them. Now I'm getting more for gifts!
Love New Balance Sneakers.  Great support and wear.
"I bought 2 pairs.. 1 for me and 1 for gifts... My friend loved it, it doesn't look cheap or what.."
"Just go my dress in the mail, I'm 5'5"" 135lb and got the Small based on the chart. The dress came and its super cute, made out of a good thick material and stretchy too. The only thing is where the sleeve joins the body is cut a little large so you have a bit of fabric there but overall the dress is very comfortable. Perfect for fall or spring."
Like it.  Good quality for the price.  I like that it doesn't have the little ball bearing at the crown of the hat to hurt your head it you happen to hit something.  Instead it is sewn in and has a velcro tab at the very top.  Pretty nice unit.  I recommend it.
"I ordered these because I needed a nude sports-type bra to wear under my white show shirt for a horse show, and failed to find any in store. The price was right so I risked these and am very happy! I'm not big on top so don't need much support, so this type of bra is great for me - if you're bigger and need support, look elsewhere, I think. Very comfy!"
Excellent. Very quick card reader; ideal for photographers and videographers
Another great shirt real men wear pink lol
"I bought several pairs of these for a 3-1/2 year old I know and they are all adorable and nice quality.  This review is for the bird print leggings which are very unique and super colorful.  The fit is just what I expected.

This print matches the Fiream dress print which is one of the cutest dresses I have ever seen.  I think the birds on these pants are slightly smaller than the birds on the dress.

Very nice quality and they wash nicely without shrinkage or color loss."
Bought this as a gift and it was well received.
Soy very good
"This is a nice size travel bag or errand diaper bag.  Sometimes I want something a little nicer than a diaper bag when I am just running quick errands with the kids.  This fits the bill. It is roomy inside with several pockets.  It also has 2 pockets on the outside.

The only thing I'm not a huge fan off is the little decorate straps at the bottom of the bag.  It isn't fully attached on the bag so half the strap just dangles there.

I hope you found this review helpful.  If you did I would LOVE it if you would click YES below."
Super cute. Tight enough to stay on your head but comfortable too.  Nice quality. Would highly recommend. I'm ordering more colors.
Nicely made and looks exactly like the photo. Great for any social occasion and looks very fancy.
These are wonderful. I was looking for something to help  stop blisters on my toes from my boots. These socks exceeded my expectations they are well made they fit perfectly they help keep my feet cool at work my toes don't rub together anymore overall they are great and I will definitely buy more
"Very comfortable, fits great. And they are so soft. Thay move when I move."
"The Amazon Collection offers this pretty 18k gold (over rhodium) multi-gemstone bracelet seven and a half inches long. Pretty, but a bit snug on the average ladies wrist this bracelet holds quite an assortment of pretty mineral samples like: topaz, amethyst, peridot, garnet, citrine & white topaz. As to the ultimate design of the piece, the stones are firmly set w/ 4 prongs onto the bracelet, while I wasn't thrilled by the bracket's closing-clasp, it's not over user-friendly, but if your lady doesn't  mind calling in an extra pair of hands (I.e. YOU) while putting on your jewelry it goes on fine. Overall we liked it, for the price and the quality of materials it's alright."
Beautiful!! I love this ring
fits well and was warm on those cold days
Super soft on the inside and comfortable. I love the boots so far!
Highly recommend this watch!  Great size and weight.  Excellent night time visibility. Nice quality watch for the money! You won't be disappointed.
"If you have to wear glasses, these will help block the sun.  Lightweight too."
I love it I need it in Ohio lol
"Great quality product for such an affordable price. Super sexy. I'm 5'3, 185. I wear a size 14 and my breast size is a 38DD. This fit me perfectly."
I love these shoes. Simple yet elegant for work.
"Wow, what a great fit, very comfortable.  I have so much trouble finding my size and this shoe was no exception.  I wear a 12 1/2 AA but had to buy the 13 AA.  No problem with a little extra room, it is so close to a prefect fit.  I would recommend these shoes to anyone interested in a great fitting dress shoe of great quality."
"Gorgeous! They are a little small to where the buttons are strained. I bought a size 11 and my measurements are 39""-30""-40"" if that helps. The dye also rubs off on your hands..."
I would rate any sock that stays up on my skinny legs 5 star. The texture of the material is nice also. Haven't had them long so have no idea how long they will hold up.
"Light fabric and very warm, great for lounging"
I like these earrings! I have been getting a few pieces of amber jewelry and thought these were cute. They were bigger than I thought (I have since learned as I order to reach for my ruler..hehe) but still very nice. :)
Good looking watch easy to read good everyday use.
great hat for very cold weather
"Great feel, great fit, great look.  I am very pleased!"
"Kind of small. I love this bag through. However, because of the one strap, it put a scar on my left shoulder."
"I absolutely love the fit of these briefs...I'm a size 33/34 waist and they fit quite snug but not tight which is ideal for underwear...the cut is impeccable and the price a true bargain, the kind of stuff Amazon is known for....definitely going to buy again."
"looked well on hubby, I would buy again"
It's a cute boot even though they are a man made material instead of leather. I haven't worn them anywhere yet so I can't say how they will feel after wearing them for a few hours but judging from the feel when I tried them on I probably won't want to do a lot of walking in them.
"As an avid hiker I have tried a number of different sock options to ensure I do not get blisters.

This includes sock liners with regular socks. Sock liners with thicker wool socks, and wrightsocks.
For anything other than extreme cold weather I will typically use these. I do prefer the crew to the low cut socks, but I think that is more of a personal preference.
These socks are very convenient in that I don't have to wear 2 pairs of socks, and they do a fine job. I have had some pairs of these socks last over 2 years, and though they don't look extremely thick, they do last a long time.
If you are going to go on extremely long 10+ mile hikes, you may want to take a couple of pairs and swap them out. These socks do seem to be less effective if your feet become extremely sweaty, or if a lot of dirt and rocks are in your boots or shoes.

They are not perfect, but their are the best all in 1 sock solution to avoid blisters."
"too good, But Too Large."
"Bought for my daughter and didn't expect much based on price, but they are well made and comfortable."
"Nice, it feels soft and comfy."
"I love these slippers. I have multiple colors. They always last. I have one pair that I wear practically every day and I've had them for, I don't know, at least five to six years. They fit snugly and are appropriate size without falling off yet do not feel uncomfortable. I like the satin because my feet get too hot. But I do have the terry cloth ones as well and they fit well and are of high quality too. Love them! And no I do not work for Isotoner :-) nor have stock :-)"
Great shoes and amazing value.  I'll purchase again once these ones wear out.
"what more can i say?  these are soooo comfy that i don't want to wear anything else.  i've had them about a month and they still seem to be in great condition.  i was a bit wary because some people complained that they fell apart, but mine are holding up great."
"The feel of the shirt is comfortable and soft feeling.  I always order one size larger for these type of shirts and this one fit great, I ordered 2xl, I'm around 190 5'11""similar slim!! :)"
THE Khakis you want. Extremely comfy
"My little one has the smallest feet! No socks would stay on her feet and with winter approaching I had to find something to keep her toes warm. I ran across these and they have been the best! They stay on her feet, easy to put on and very soft. I got the dark gray and I like it but personally I think I would have liked the light gray better. However, they have lots of colors to choose from so I may just buy another pair! I bought size 6 Months and she was almost 5 Months when she started wearing them. They were a little big (again, she has super small feet) but they stayed on no problem and she's 7 months now and they still fit!"
"Love Stance socks. not too thick. they grab your feet/ankles nicely, so no socks that are falling down. and the styles/colors are super stylish."
By far some of my favorite jeans have been bought off Amazon and these are definitely in the top five of my favorite jeans
My daughter really like this watch.
fits great and keeps your legs warm and to worry about have your legs get cold its all good too.
"Had this pair for a few months now. I'm a 5 and half. The those are true to size, beautiful and durable. Only problem is I'm used to light shoes. Those took me a while to adjust. If I'm not wearing it for a whole day it's fine."
"I love the idea of the stretch ""leather"". There is a ridge below the toe area which helps the contour. I would prefer the front to tip up a bit more to avoid tripping."
"Love this dress!  I was hesitant because so many people said there was no stretch and that it ran small.  I normally wear a size 12 or a large in dresses, but I ordered an XL.  I think this was definitely the right choice because it fit very well and hugged my curves.  It does have a bit of stretch, similar to the way a cotton t-shirt might.  The quality seems pretty good for the price and I loved the pattern.  I'm 5'4"" and it went down to right above my knees.  I'd definitely recommend!"
"hubbys was good fit still runs small though . and good color unlike the one i ordered for myself (different shirt ,same brand) lets hope they don't shrink when washed and dried"
"Tom Petty, Great as always!"
"What a cute, sexy wrap! My wife is 39-27-39, and it fits great - a bit of a split on the tie side, but it's meant to be sexy, and show a bit of leg. It is sheer, and comfortable, and makes an ideal wrap for a bikini bottom, or with nothing at all!"
"perfect fit, great comfort"
"Love it, it's my new favorite ! But I'm a size 10 these days, after reading reviews I ordered an xxlarge.& It's still snug...but I'm losing weight everyday & I love the coat !! What is with the sizing...never ever have I ordered an xxl before !"
She loves these shoes!  She likes to buy Keen's because the fit is always just right.
"I love it.  It is beautifully made and even though the stones are not real gemstones, they glimmer like real ones.  Looks great on.
Thanks."
great. Would buy again.
"They are heavy, be careful if you're to be standing up all day long."
Got this for my husband and he loves it! He shows it off and is never without it. Gives him security and is worth purchasing if your hubby can't help breaking the aluminum ones due to overstuffing!
"Love it...i will most definately buy it again and again.
I just wish they will send it faster.
It took a while to receive."
product was exactly as described/pictured
Was a gift for a friend. She loved it!
"The color was right , the fit was excellent ."
"I really like these shoes. They are neat. They have a closed toe and heel which is a requirement when we take our dog to the hospital for pet therapy. I had a hard time deciding exactly what size to order. I ordinarily wear a 7 1/2, but I knew these shoes, made of fabric as they are, would probably stretch, and my foot is fairly narrow. So I ordered the 7. At first when I tried them on I thought I had made a mistake, but sure enough they stretched quickly to become quite comfortable. I had seen them on other people and thought they looked good."
So comfy! I'll be getting more.
"Exellent shirt, I ent back and bought another I like it so much.  highly recommended!"
"I am 6'0"" and 165 lb with 33 size waist and bought two Red colors in M and one Super Blue in L size to compare and chooe one. There is a bigger than expected size difference between the M and L sizes. I usually opt for the large in many jackets and tops I buy because I have very broad shoulders but lean body, but in this case the Large was bulky. It is very wide cut especially around the waist. It depends on how you want it to fit; Just as a rain jacket, the large is fine with room for a sweater or sweatshirt when it's cold I would choose the large for hiking. The Medium fit just right, looks good even for a casual wear with not much room for a bulky sweater but can wear a sweatshirt or long sleeve T-shirt under it for warmth. Mind you, all pictures were taken while wearing a t-shirt only. Also there is definitely a slight but noticeable cut difference BETWEEN THE TWO MEDIUM sizes I purchased caused probably by period of production and slight design changes that accompanied it. For starters the Rocket Red fit me more nicely with a slightly more room around the shoulders and wider overall cut and the mesh was softer and more fine. overall more comfortable to wear. The Mountain Red was a little snug around the shoulders and sides and the mesh is definitely coarser on my arms which is fine, but since I have broad shoulders I chose the Rocket Red. The Mountain Red had a solid polyester fabric right below the collar where the Columbia tag is for durability, but the Rocket Red was soft mesh all the way to the edge of the collar. Also the mesh interior is more fine and softer on the Rocket Red than the  Mountain Red. Also the Blue one has fine soft mesh also and missing the collar solid polyester  fabric. I would bet the Rocket Red is a discontinued product since it's not offered on Columbia.com as well as many of the colors offered here on Amazon. So I can assume the colors here that are not offered on Columbia's website are probably discontinued and will have a softer mesh and fit a little bit more loose or classic fit. I guess Columbia upgraded it to make it more durable around the neck area and fit more modern a little bit. I would also like to add about one other review that said quality defect in one pocket being sewn all the way to the hem but not the other pocket(Left pocket), IT IS NOT A QUALITY ISSUE, that pocket is where you pack the jacket. it has a two sided zipper, so you can turn the pocket inside out and pack the whole jacket inside, so it's intentionally sewn that way. All the three jackets I got where sewn like that. It will have a patch near the zipper pocket that says PACKABLE. Overall really nice quality jacket as to be expected from Columbia, and a steal on these prices, in stores it usually is  twice."
"While I haven't yet traveled with this, I have worn it around the house to make sure it was comfortable (and it is). It fits my passport in the larger pocket and will keep my cash secure for traveling. I feel it is a good value."
"I love this robe. It is super soft, warm and luxurious. Definitely recommend this as a purchase."
walking on heaven !
GREAT PRODUCT! I OWN ANOTHER CARHARTT BELT AND THESE ARE THE BEST BELTS I HAVE EVER OWNED!
As described.  My 5 year old got the largest size due to complaints the costume runs small....costume runs true to advertised unless a large child is in the pic.
I bought these to go with a black widow costume and they work perfectly! They fit great and look great!
Very pleased with the shirt!
I Love this neck chain. It is sparkly with the diamond cut. It's thick enough to hold my heaviest pendants or more than one. I have gotten many compliments each time I wear it. Looks great by itself too.
"I have many pairs of these sandals, in various colors, this one being my favorite. I'm on my feet all day, and these are so comfy! They last forever. Only Sanuk, off brand imitators don't measure up."
"I love the stretchy very soft fabric on this cardigan.  It hugs my arms but is not tight.  Sometimes I wear the front ends down as shown in the pics, but sometimes I loosely tie them at the hips.  It's great as a dance cover up or for around the house. After buying the coral color, I bought two more.  My favorite color is the lavender -- just a perfect lavender, not too pale.  The coral at first seemed too bright, almost a red tomato color.  But when I wear it I swear that I feel peppier.  I'm not sure yet about the white - it is a very stark, almost ice blue white, seems a bit like old-fashioned nursing uniform color.  I have machine washed and dried these and they have come out fine so far."
"For the price, these are great. They do not keep your feet warm though. Wear warm socks and you'll be fine!"
I ordered this tie for my husband to wear on our wedding day. Great texture and good quality material which makes for great value. I would definitely recommend it.
"perfect fit for my chuka boots, the colour matched perfecly too. 2 pair of laces is a plus as well. I Definitely recommended this brand."
"Great sports shirt in a fantastic, soft fabric. Love this!"
"Bought this for a Christmas present and my sister loves it. She already has other parts to this luggage set so she was very happy to get the carryon piece. Good quality, lightweight, easy to maneuver, and good utilization of storage space."
"Great fit,,,,will buy it again."
"LOVE these crop pants, super soft and fits just perfect.  I am 5'3"" 125, small fits great."
Got this to travel out of the country. Holds the passport nicely and is very convenient. Only thing I wasn't too fond of is that the tickets didn't fit where they are supposed to go.
"Firstly, I must say that I bought these pants at a discounted price for my honest review. These pants look great and feel great. Standard scrub pants with quality material. My only complaint is that I ordered an extra small, and they are still somewhat too big for me. Even if I hike them up to my upper abdomen and tie them tight, they're still too long and baggy. I shouldn't have to order an extra small, as I am 5'3"" and 135 lbs. I normally wear a size 5 in pants. Therefore, this brand does not have a size that actually fits me, sadly."
"I'm on my second pair, wear these almost every day. You can dress them up or down. Great shoes and worth the price."
This costume was super cute! My son loved it. Good price and great quality!
"My first purchase of a swatch. It came in exactly as described. Nothing really super fancy about the watch in itself except that the styling with the double band on your wrist is what you pay for. This is obviously for an adult/grown up in size but I believe you could buy it from 12+ year old kid, depends on their wrist size."
"This watch is beautiful, though a bit plain for my tastes. It's great for dressier or business occasions, when wearing slightly ""blingier"" watches won't do. I do wish it had some sparkle to it, but - again - it's good for business."
"I really love these sandals, they are the 2nd pair.  They are wonderful for walking and climbing and don't make my feet sore.  Keep in mind, they are not slim but wider sandals and really are for more athletic activities, but a great shoe...mine have traveled all over central and south america and they don't seem to wear out."
"I am a 10 1/2 Wide (11 W is what I usually have to buy).  I read the reviews and took my chances, even though I couldn't go up a size like people recommended.
I bought an 11, and the actual footbed fit with plenty of room, but the instep is not high enough, especially towards the ankle.  I have extremely wide feet, so I can't imagine this boot not being wide enough for anyone's foot.  But, unless you have a low instep--in other words if your foot is the same height from the toes to your ankle, it will probably be too tight for you."
Look nice and are super comfortable!
My daughter loves this skirt. Super cute and fits great.
"My 4yo had another pair of these Saucony's, she outgrew them and we bought her some more. They are durable, easy to put on, and comfortable."
Completely happy with this purchase.  I bought them as a snow boot for the Colorado winter and they do the job pretty well.
Great pair of boots.  Comfortable too.
"Just as described, fast shipping."
"I was reading the reviews and was worried the color would be not as pictured, but it is pretty much as pictured: a medium brown with blonde highlights."
"This is a nice product.  It is free from alcohol and parabens which is a real plus.  It has a nice cooling sensation when it goes on and the smell is clean and not overpowering.  While I like this product, my standard toner is witch hazel which works as well and is significantly less expensive"
"I love these shoes! Took them on a trip right out of the box, and they really didn't require any breaking in. Very comfortable right from the start. These are dressy enough to wear with a skirt, but also look great with jeans. Great shoes!"
My grandson was very happy with his new backpack. He has so many books to lug around so having a backpack with wheels is so much easier for him. It is very roomy and holds everything
"It is a big too small, but I can still use it. I hope to get a better idea how things fit me at this point."
Very nice cami. Would buy again.
Son really loves these. Fits nicely and comfortable.
