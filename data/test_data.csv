"I have had Freya in past but this particular style did not fit at all!  I couldn't move for and the wire poked through.
Very unhappy."
"I hated this bag, but I sold it to Buffalo exchange for almost what I paid for it anyway so whatever"
While it looks from the picture to be fitted to the waist it is not.  This is an empire waist dress.  Would not have ordered it if I knew that so I returned it.
"This is the time of year for great bargains online at Amazon.  I've probably bought two dozen pairs of shoes on Amazon over the years, and they have always fit perfectly.  Now these shoes are the exception.  I cannot believe how TINY they are.  It says on the box that they are size 9.5 (I ordered larger after reading reviews).  However, I took a good look and never even tried to get a toe in them.

They look like they might fit an eight year-old child.  Never seen such itty-bitty adult shoes.  Since they were so cheap to begin with, I'm not going to bother to return them.  I'll just hand them over to the next female child I see."
Uhhhh. Not for guys. Does anyone other then kd sell a pair of riding glasses for night hahahaaa
"i got the wrong belt! i am not please at all. i wanted the buckle belt with horses and all of that i saw on the belt, this one is just plain buckle"
Good style and leather quality but definitely not a wide shoe.
I wish the quality was in the shirt but it simply is not. The fabric is thin and Puckers after its been washed and dried. This one is not going to last me long.
I guess if you worked at a rubber office the would be the best thing to use. This tote is so stinky like rubber that I cant use it. euwwwwww I hate this thing!!!!!!!
Crappy robe. Falls apart every wash. Doesn't hold together and is now mostly see thru.
I like the design but it came from China. Their size chart is one size down from USA size chart. For example : USA size chart XL equals China size chart L. Please be careful.
I am very disappointed. The front is very loose & the cris cross thing is very very tight. I wear US size 8. Very poorly made
"What I recieved looked nothing like the picture. First of all the boots I recieved are GREEN! Not black. Second of all they are a dull scratched off texture and not shiny black.

*update* low and behold the new pair they sent are green too. I guess I have a difference of opinion when it comes to something that is forest green and the color black. Everyone who has seen the boots they mailed me agree the color is a dark green. Why everyone commenting on these boots have failed to mention this is beyond me. For over $100 I want quality nice BLACK leather boots!"
Not true to sizes.... Past on to co-workers.
Very tight around the legs. Not quite the right cut for bell bottoms.
"While these shoes are comfortable at first, they are not a good running shoe.  After a few short runs (2-3 miles each), the soles were so worn that i can push on them with my finger and they have a lot of give.  My foot has made an immediate impression inside the shoe from running that putting them on I feel like I'm sinking to the bottom of the shoe already.  After a few runs, I've retired these shoes as running shoes and only wear them around the house to do chores.  It's a shame.  Also - I wear 8M and I had to return these for 7.5M.  The shoe still fits a little wide.  I feel like I slide around in them.  I like Fila and have a ton of other running shoes and apparel.  I recommend Fila...just not this shoe."
Didn't realize it was very padded. Looks nice with a sweater. Not terribly comfortable
This shoe is a nice shoe but it is a little wide in the heal area. Fits good and I love the color. I'll have to work with the heal by adding fillers.
this fit true to size but it is the most graceless shoe i have every put on my feet. that is a weird heel height for a loafer. i felt like i was pitching forwad as i walked.
not fro me
This does not fit at all. It's smaller than shown.
"EDIT: Just a few days after the 30 day return policy, I find the stitching on the left shoe is coming apart. These are inferior quality shoes, and obviously were not made in the US. I prided myself on buying New Balance shoes because they were heralded as being a US company - that does NOT seem to be the case anymore.

Figures that the stitching would last just beyond the 30 day mark so I can't return these. DO NOT waste your money on these shoes, if you look at other reviews, they tend to fall apart rather quickly. I am sticking with Sketchers from here on out."
Like the previous reviews I also received an all red headband and not red white and blue like in the picture
The cups are too small.  More like a D than a DDD.  VERY DISAPPOINTED.  Bra is very stiff and unyielding.
These do NOT fit up to a 2x. They dip down incredibly low in the back and will run like pantyhose if damaged. Would like to see a proper plus size. These might have worked if I were 5' tall.
It get break off frome second use
These are not real 501 shrink to fit.
Bought these hats for sun protection. Hoping they will do the trick. My husband is outside a large part of the day and has had cancer spots on his head. He usually wears baseball hats but they don't cover as much as this hat will.
"I ordered these shoes in october, the first pair was peeling on the bottom of the sole were the beige sole meets the dark brown, I thought it was a manufacturers defect so I ordered a replacement and they did the same thing. They were comfortable and looked great too I would say better than the sperrys but quality is low super low I was really disappointed to see how easy it would peel. They are not $20 shoes, I think wal mart brand would hold up better."
"Some of the beads are ok, but most came broken. A couple of them have tarnished rims, which obviously indicates they are not silver."
This shirt is nothing like it looks in the picture. The material is very casual like till. It is NOT a dress shirt like it appears in the picture.
Or should say too tight
"Only one of the sneaker lights up the left foot sneaker does not and now you do not have another pair available in size 12.5, this was a Christmas gift for my granddaughter and I was very dissatisfied."
"I ordered a slightly bigger pair for my daughter's school shoes with the intent if having a little room to grow in throughout the school year.  It fits just right when it arrived, no room at all. My daughter wears a size 13 regularly and I ordered a 1.5. Had to return and order a newer pair. This time amazon trying to save money on packaging, placed the box of shoes in an unlined plastic envelope. When it arrived box and packaging were mangled beyond recognition and shoes damaged.  Amazon was kind enough to refund but I ended up buying my daughter's school shoes elsewhere."
"These shoes are way to small. I usually wear a size 8 and ordered a half size up due to it being a pointy toe but I couldn't even fit my foot in these shoes. Love the style and the color but I will be returning them, had it came in a wide I may have been ok."
The green enamel was cracked when I opened the package. That's disappointing. I guess for $4 and free shipping you get what you pay for.
Poor quality and I did not receive the bottoms that were supposed to come with it. My granddaughter never wore it. I ended up giving it to  goodwill
Odd fit through the body. Shape is off. I sent it back.
Came in one solid color and stays wrinkled
"The product is beautiful, good quality, the material and the construction is beautiful, but it is very small, not for the size L, equivalent to a little more than the M size, I use size L and does not serve me, my daughter is a size M and also serves, give you as a gift to my sister who wears size S and if it is, does not enjoy it, they must correct size for customer satisfaction is a very beautiful product but it was not useful, I live in Venezuela and not I can change because it is very expensive and slow change. I am totally dissatisfied with the size.."
"Can confirm, these are awkwardly tight around the shoulders, but wide on the sides. I'm 5'10, 170 lbs with a bigger bust, so size L was good as far as not constricting my chest and was a good length, but I would probably not get this style again."
I threw it in the trash. Fits so weird- large on the torso and super tight on the arms- this too is badly made. The color is nice but that's about it.
This is a horrible product. It doesn't fit right. I returned it. there is a reason this is on sale.
"I had ordered the pink flowered boot for my granddaughter.  It is really pretty and pleasing to the eye.  However, the laces are not good for a five year old who can't tie shoe laces herself yet.  She would have been running around with open boots all day.  She really needs Velcro which stays closed with no problem all day.  In addition, the zipper is probably not a good idea - it would be a good entry point for water, leaving a child's feet wet and cold.  For these reasons, I wound up returning the boots and found great boots with Velcro closings, and which you just slip your feet into (no zippers)."
these were much too big than expected. i needed to get at least two sizes smaller than my actual size.
The elastic crinkles and it just doesn't look good on person.  On any person.
"I own one of these bras that I bought in a local store.  It fits perfectly and is very comfortable.  Then I got 2 through Amazon and they're totally different. The bands are tighter and the cups are bigger.  I checked them carefully to make sure I got the right thing.  According to the labels, I have the same items.  Obviously, though, these were made in different places. .Into the trash they go."
It cut into my legs
"These boots are going back.  There is not enough arch support, and they are difficult to put on and take off.  The snaps that fold the lip of the boot down are also difficult to close."
Sent it back. Didn't like the fit or the fabric combo.
Material is very cheap.
Did not like the cut of the top.  To confining in the shoulder chest area.
"Looks so pretty online but the fabric is almost like an uncomfortable spandex poly mix. I'm 5'6"" and it came up above my angle. So unfortunately not for tall girls."
"This backpack is cute and it works. It is not made out of the best materials. The green has pretty much become brown in a couple of months, and there are holes on the bottom. The handle and zippers seem fine. It is the fabric that is cheap. I wish it would last longer, but next time I'll have to spend the money for a Jansport."
Very cheapy wig. You get what you pay for.
"These shoes were really comfortable but I ended up throwing them away because they smelled so bad -- not a funky foot odor, but like a urine odor!  I only wore them for 1/2 a day once a week (for nursing school clinical) and I threw them away after about 6 weeks.  I don't have excessively sweaty or smelly feet, especially for how little the shoes were worn, so it was definitely a problem with the shoes."
I had these boots on my wishlist for a long time.  When they hit 50% off retail I jumped.  I was so hopeful because they were Teva that they would be comfortable.  I found them to be stiff and narrow.  I usually wear an 8.5 and that's what I ordered.  They were a smidge short in the footbed length.  I also found the overall height to be on the shorter side.  Sending them back.
What a disappointment mad as H**L $ 70 wasted couldn't return it had to break down the back like a flip flop to get home painfiul they felt as they were gonna be comfortable but after walking all day in it i almost died. Not overdoing it im talking real talk.
Returned it.  Smelled real funky.  Breathing through the nose wasn't the greatest.
Too BIG!  Size is incorrect
"This is a poor product, material is harsh and uncomfortable...returned, size is strange and is not as discribed"
"This did not remotely look as good as in the picture.. large, thin and simply does not fit!! Bought it a while back and just couldn't be bothered leaving a feedback cuz it's really not worth any feedbacks at all!!"
Stiff material and unflattering. Doesn't move with you or fit right
Fell apart after a couple months.
"Not happy.  The bra is nice enough, but the underwire comes up too high or something - it sticks out and shows when I put clothing on - any kind, t-shirt, dress blouse, whatever!  And I bought this to wear with clothing! :-/  Bought 2, 2 are going back.  I'll watch for this ""high center"" on any other bras I purchase, though I have had no problem with it in the past.  Perhaps my increased cup size has something to do with this (went from C to D) though I highly doubt it."
Do not purchase these!  They are very poor quality - arrive with 3 of 4 pairs either broken or missing pieces...returned immediately!
"Ok so I followed everyone's advice and got not one, but two extra sizes (Asia XLarge which allegedly equals US Large)

Now somebody explain to me why my Medium hoodies feel loose and this thing feels like I can barely breath in it.

Such a shame. The design is beautiful. But if you're a medium, go for XXL unless you've got a six-pack or are extremely skinny. In that case, get the XLarge."
"Way too big and long....
Purchased the Medium size I normally wear, but it seems a size bigger.
Very upset about it."
Weird strange fit.
I had to return these shoes b/c it was the only available size and they were big for me.
"Uh seriously?
Are you guys serious rating this 5 stars
This is a terrible terrible product and I'm 110% positive it is not nautica most of my sons wardrobe consists of nautica and they would never sell this trash
First off they are black not blue as depicted they also are painted and they weren't even painted well there is paint all over the pockets also the paint smell is intoxicating and I have no idea what size they are but They are not 2T which is stated on the tags and jeans themselves I compared them to a normal size 2T in my photos"
I own several pairs of Vionic shoes... these were way too large around my foot....and the straps were restricted from tightening.... returned them...
"It's really pretty fabric, but the material is pretty thin. The real issue is that the sizes are off. I am 5'6 and 130, and ordered a small. But the arms and the bust was way too tight. It wouldn't even zip. I ordered as the this time around, hope it fits.

Update: I ordered a large and it fit a lot better. Maybe a few alterations here and there, but for the price it's pretty legit."
Bought these a yr ago and to-date half of them have broken. I bought these to put on a second pair of running shoes. A friend of mine first gave me a pack about 5yrs ago and only five of them have broken in that period of time. These must be made of inferior material because they sure don't last as long.
"I like the color and the overall shape and design, but the bust was waaaaay to big. The cup size is about three sizes too big for me. I wear a size A cup and this was just ridiculous. There is just too much room on the top. It was clearly made for a larger woman with ample breasts, something like a DD cup size. I ordered it in this size because I'm fat and my waist is too big, because I eat too much and my stomach comes out. I thought of keeping this bathing suit for myself simply because I paid for it and my family members don't like it when I return things, but I will probably give this bathing suit away to one of my best friends who is around my size and weight AND has DD breasts. By the way, I'm around 170lbs and am 5'6"" tall. I wear a 38A bra and my measurements are 38""-37""-44"". I usually wear a size 14 pants and can wear anything from a size L-size XXL dress size depending on the maker. Also, I have an old pair of NYDJ blue jeans in a size 18 that I fit perfectly. It's hard to shop online and find a perfect fit. I hope this helps some of you buyers make a good decision on this bathing suit and other clothes."
Cute design but because the fabric is so cheaply made it doesn't hold much shape.
"I was trying to find something to fit my narrow face.  The only description regarding size was ""unisex"", so I took a chance on this.  They were decent looking sunglasses, but much too large for my face, but I found I could bend them to wrap tighter to my face, but was afraid to try to permanently bend them to this position.  So I emailed JiMarti customer service with 2 simple questions:  Is there a way to reshape them to fit my face better, or if not, do you sell models for narrower faces?  The first response from ""Misty"" said ""since that was an Amazon order, we don't have any info on that.  Contact Amazon and they will hook you right up"".  What?  So I responded to Misty asking if they aren't in fact able to answer questions about a specific model of THEIR OWN sunglasses, and repeated the questions in more simpler form.  Misty's next response was equally baffling and of no help:  ""We can't custom fit sunglasses via email, that's why we offer a 30-day return policy.""  I think she was named ""Misty"" because of the mist between her ears.  Hopefully she's not representative of the whole company, but either way, I will be returning these glasses and in my further searches will skip over any JiMarti brand sunglasses.  If you've got a big head,  you may like these."
"these things are awful, and it doesn't make a difference if you have large boobs or small ones, they don't stay put, thank god me and my daughter both wore them under shirts, because as soon as we started moving around, picking up the house doing chores, they were around our stomachs...they're fine if you're lazy and sit on your butt all day.."
pills after wash.
I don't understand how they can say an XL fits up to size 18 no way in heck. Maybe size 12 at the most! To bad because I liked the idea of matching with the baby :(  Material was very stiff too.
This is really bad I ordered the wallet with 3 windows & I received a different wallet with one window
Cute. A bit tight for the first few wears. After a month the strap broke!!!
"I received these shoes and had intended to use them in a aqua zumba class. I tried on the right shoe, and noticed that the ""pull"" tab on the heel was not stitched tightly so I checked out the left shoe and found the same problem with it as well as the stiching around the ankle of the foot on the shoe was coming out. It was as though it just did not get stiched correctly that the machine may have been skipping stiches or that it just did not catch the mesh part with the binding part. Anyway, I was very disappointed and returned them with NO Problem with Amazon!! Thank you Amazon Prime membership for your rapid response and ease of returning this product."
They seem not authentic from Steave Maden
"Buy a size SMALLER, or TWO if you want the ""sleek"" fill, otherwise it's like wearing baggy panties with shoulder straps."
"love the texture, but the fit just was too small and maybe encourage me to shed a few pounds... seem to be good quality and make."
"The skirt is ""garbage"", when I got the skirt, it looks worn and there were holes in it; plus the piping that ran through the skirt, most of them were coming out..I would never, ever, ever, recommend anyone to buy this piece of junk. I couldn't even return it, because it came from all the way India, and the return postage is almost the price of the skirt."
"I took a chance that this bag wasn't as bad as other reviewers have thought and I liked the style, so, I went ahead and ordered it. The seller was fine, I received it in a timely manner and had no issues. I didn't know what to expect when I opened it. It was packaged well, came with a duster bag which is cool, I suppose. The bag does have a new vinyl smell to it. It wasn't awful or anything I didn't expect. I think other reviewers have exaggerated about the smell. I mean, it stands to reason it would have a smell. New everything has a smell, and of course this bag isn't going to smell like roses or leather because its made of neither.

I wasn't expecting Chanel quality, and anyone who buys a $40 purse shouldn't either unless you've got some mental problems. That being said, it is not that great of a bag, but its not the absolute worst either. Honestly, I have yet to use it, and most likely, I won't use it as a purse. The bag itself is just too shiny black because of the material. Shiny is fine, but it's definitely a sheen that cheap material possesses.
For instance, the bag I have been using for the past 8 months (long time for me to stick with one bag) is faux ostrich leather, was $60, great quality and it still looks and functions like its a bag that cost a few hundred. I had hoped this bag would surprise me like the bag I have, unfortunately it failed to impress me at all. It's just kinda 'whatever'.
It definitely isn't as plush as the photos make it look. By that, I mean the padding of the quilting isn't as full and because of that, the stitching is very awkwardly apparent, making it look a bit deflated. If it weren't for that, I think it would look a lot better and I might even have used it as a purse.
It is very roomy and a great size. The gold hardware is very gold. That purse I mentioned that I have also has gold hardware and is studded in gold pyramid studs. The hardware on this bag looks very 99 Cent store in comparison. It's a tinny gold, and I don't really dig it. I honestly think its the combination of those things that make it a lackluster purchase. I would have rather put the money I spent on this toward something else, that's all.
I feel like it doesn't deserve rave reviews but I also don't believe it deserves overly negative reviews either. Some people may love it, others won't...but that's the way with anything, right?"
Shoe only was wearable for 1 month. The bottom had to be glued twice just to be able to wear it. Very disappointed.
If you are an adult I'd recommend not buying this... If you are looking for a smaller training bra for a child this is ideal. I am a 34C and I got the largest size available and it was so small on me. There is no way this is in adults sizing.
I ordered them in my normal size but ran a little big. So had to send them back.....  but a nice shoe..
i was cosplaying as Dave Strider from Homestuck and this wig is a dark gold. it completely different from the picture i was really upset and its a bowl cut shape so it was really hard to style. i was mad. i ordered a light blonde wig and i got a dark gold.
"I returned it the next day, very low quality and design."
"Was a gift for my mom's bday she said it looks great just the necklace came broken, the clasp was a parently in the bottom of the box."
"product is fake turquoise, spend the more to get actual turquiose"
I am a size 14 so I purchased the med/large some of the reviews said it was very stretchy but its not enough for me..its way too small for me.
"I wanted an all black watch with easily read face, but this one is small for my arm and wrist, so I gave it to my wife. It serves as a good work watch for her when she needs a black one."
"At first, the item was never received.  The seller then shipped it ""again"" and this time when I received it, I found that the Men's Large gloves that I ordered looked liked a pair of children's gloves.  On the tag it stated ""one size fits all.""  I struggled to get one of the gloves on one of my hands in hopes it would conform to my hand but found that it didn't.  I emailed the seller to resolve this issue and got ZERO response back... ""nothing.""  HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!"
These shoes are very comfortable to wear. Ok looking not all that cute but so very comfortable. My only real issue is that they are already starting to smell horrible. Like to the point I am not sure I can wear them snymore. So I wore them for about a week and they stink so bad. Not sure the smell will ever come out. I don't have issues with other shoes but these are just stinky!
"They are warm, but they fit more like socks than slippers."
Part of the decoration came off the first time I wore them..  I have the same shoe with gold decorations which have been worn many many times without problem.  I contacted the seller and got no response..will never use them again..
Looks great but too small.... my little boy toes touched the end right away (And I chose a size he was just getting in !)
"This fits, but is marked as a 30I and it is a little too small. I also ordered a 30DDD and received the 30 I that is a little too small. Also one of the clasps was missing when I received this."
"For the shirt being a 2x it was really  small,and I am a size 16, Which should have been loose on me."
"I didn't like these at all.  They were too big around the foot and not wide enough at the top.  Granted, I have large calves, so I pretty much gave up on higher rain boots.  But even if they had fit my calves ok, the rest would have still been awkward."
"I always read the reviews but failed to do so this time. Wish I had! The bag is WAY smaller than what I had envisioned I'd get for $5. There's a reason the size of the bag isn't advertised! I'd guesstimate this is only around 10-11"" tall. I don't mind that it's not a cloth bag, but it's certainly not worth $5."
"Shirt runs on the small size. Short on length also.  Material is very soft so it has a nice feel, but seems a little thin. Probably won't last long."
Fabric soft and nice but arm hole is low so my bra shows and fabric stretches over the course of the day so the front of my bra showed too.
These look like they're for a toddler. What a waste of money!
I am really disappointed in these.  The 3 hooks on the extension didn't line up with the 3 hooks on the bra and are completely unusable.  The 2 hook ones fit ok ( but they aren't the ones I needed).  Waste of my money.  The quality of materials seemed fine though.
Sizing is off. Way too small
Much bigger than an 8.5. More like 9.5. Wonder if there were marked down because they were not properly sized.
"Buying bras online is sooo hard!!

Could be better could be worse. Fit as expected.i never wear it."
Pure JUNK.
"FOR ME, THIS SHOE IS JUST UNCOMFORTABLE.  AS I WALK, THE HEEL HITS AND THEN THE FRONT WITH A DISTINCT ""FLOP"" SOUND.
FEELS WAY TOO STIFF..  I LIKE THIS TYPE SHOE TO CONFORM AND FLEX WITH MY FEET.  EVEN THOUGH MY CORRECT SIZE, THIS DOES NOT FIT LIKE A GLOVE.  FEELS A BIT MORE LIKE A WOODEN SANDAL."
Expansion zipper broken after one trip. I really like every aspect of the suitcase except for the fact that I got it home from my trip to find that the zipper for expanding the suitcase was off the track on one side. I didn't even use this feature when packing because I had plenty of room left. Now I'm concerned about the durability of the main zippers and the suitcase will be fully expanded anytime I use it now :( I don't think I can return the item since I've already used it at this point.
I recently bought the pink one for my 1st grader and the back pack is completely falling apart.  It has only been 4 months of light weight use and the side pocket is already ripped and the material on the inside is flaking off.  I don't understand what happened to the quality because I had bought the same brand in black 2 years ago for my now 3rd grader and the back pack has held up pretty well aside for the little zipper tag falling off.  It is still in use with heavy books sometimes.
They fit great but I was hoping for real leather uppers. These are that Birko-Flor stuff that cracks and breaks. VERY disappointed!! The ad said they were leather.
"The Zipper Broke after my Son wore this for the 1st time
Poorly made."
"As of now, this watch is unavailable on Amazon. If it comes back, just be sure of what you're getting. Although it's billed as having a stainless steel case, it's actually base metal (the case back is stainless). The ""Technofiber"" band is a cheap thin fake leather. It's a large, bulky watch that looks pretty impressive in the pictures, but there's no sense of quality to it at all. The final straw was that mine was defective- it was impossible to push the crown in all the way to keep the date set correctly. I exchanged it for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Invicta-Men-s-1462-Vintage-Collection-Riveted-Leather-Strap-Yellow-Dial-Watch/dp/B00564MEK4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Invicta Men's 1462 Vintage Collection Riveted Leather Strap Yellow Dial Watch</a>, a much better big retro watch for the money."
Not even worth it
"The fit is okay, but they are not comfortable."
it isn't at all what i expected. i would never wear this dress.
"I wear from 10 1/2 to 11 1/2, so you'd think a size 11 should fit just right.  The slippers were way too big, so I returned them.  I was not given the option of an exchange.  Today I was informed that I had been charged $6.00 for the return shipping.  I don't plan to buy them in a smaller size, since apparently I would be changed for the return if they don't fit, either."
The gray looks more like an off black.
"I put the necklace on as soon as I recieved it and my hair kept catching in the chain and the hook.  After a few days of wearing it, I felt a burn starting where the hook layed on my neck.  Then a full week of wear, it was burning my neck where the necklace lay against my skin.  The hair pulling really bothered me but I cannot deal with jewerly burning my skin when its not suppose to.  I do not recommend this necklace to anyone with a sensitivity to certain metals....it says it is nickle free but something was burning me and I don't know what it was."
Too tight...hurt my feet
It is not long enough to wrap as in picture.
"I thought this dress was really cute, so I ordered it online. When I received it, it fit me well, but I didn't like the fabric (it's a lot like a disposable tablecloth) and the ruffles on the top simply did not suit my frame (which isn't anyone's fault). Unhappy with my purchase, I tried to return this item. Amazon patched me through to the seller, who told me that I could not return it and offered to refund me $4 and suggested that I give this to a friend. Amazon is usually VERY good about returns, so a warning about this item- NO RETURNS."
"seemed like a good idea, but it wasn't.  Hard to put on, really not much support, did nothing for my posture.  Sent it back."
"Small,  small. Always too small.  Sorry to say."
Nice but Mine didn't even glow
Beautiful dress but run extra small.
"Flimsy and cheap feeling. The bottoms were MUCH thinner than previous MBT's that I have purchased. The rocker bottom was FLAT... that is, it only rocked front to back, not side to side in any way. The tongue of the shoe was laughably thin, almost a piece of fabric with no padding.
Utter garbage. If Amazon had not fulfilled these I would have thought them counterfeits. Bad counterfeits. Regardless, these are being returned."
"This was the most unflattering top ever.  I order from Amazon ALL the time, and VERY rarely, if ever, returned anything, and this was immediately returned.  Unless you're flat-chested and very thin, I wouldn't recommend."
Pretty shoe but I guess my foot is really narrow because when I walk the middle of the shoe just gaps as if it is too wide.
Good leather but much too large.  Takes up too much space in my bag.
"need to exchange, these were way too small!!"
"Read the reviews. Size down with your order. My daughter normally wears a 5T, but I purchased the 2-3. It fits great, but the sleeves need pinned so they stay on her shoulders. The dress is well made and beautiful.

*****Above was my original review, but I'm here to update! My daughter wore this dress twice and it's tearing st the seams!!!******"
No sweat resistant or seawater
This shirt started to tear as soon as my son put it on. the fabric is of a horrible quality.
"I ordered my usual 38"" waist size and when these arrived, I could not get these on. I then measured the waist end to end and they came to 35"", even though the tag said 38"". Called the seller on the phone and they refused to accept return shipping charges since these were marked 38"" and were ""not defective"", as if it's my fault for ordering my size and not getting it.

This is the second pair of Dickies shorts that had to go back to a seller (two different sellers, one not on Amazon) and those were the only pairs of Dickies shorts I have ever bought. Bad odds I would say. Don't really know what is going on in the Dickies corporation and don't really care at this point but a 38"" waist, when measured out should come to 38"", no matter where they are made. Bad design. Bad quality control. Bad customer service.

I never will buy anything with a Dickies label on it ever again. Buyer beware."
This isn't a shoe on sale. Adidas seems to have knocked itself off. Terrible shoe.
"I'm so envious of the women that have no issues with the fit! I really liked the print on the swimsuit. It camouflaged the dreaded mommy pooch that I have but man...the fit is just way off. I see what people are saying. I got a XXXL even though I'm about a size 10 dress size now and my top didn't hold the girls in, if you know what I mean haha. But the bottom was too big?! Like what?! They should really consider selling the sizes separately.  They'd probably make even more sales! Unfortunately, I have to return this product. So bummed!"
This is just total trash. The fabric is not even cloth but some kind of plastic. I just toss it out and would not even give it to Goodwill.
"A) There are two different colors of blue lace so it looks noticeably weird.
B) The lining is see through so it will need a slip if...
C) It weren't so freakishly short! It is an Asian Large which, little did I know, is like an American XSmall. It's more like a strange looking shirt.

I really had high hopes based on the reviewer who included a photo. The dress looks good on her. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
"Very cute for my courtney love-inspired get up, but the zipper broke completely off immediately. Thank goodness I was wearing a long flannel over the top to mask all of the safety pins I used to keep it closed!"
"material is very nice, the lining is fantastic, but way way too small.  ordered xxl, but was really more of a larger large. too bad too because the lining is very soft and warm but was way too small, had to return it."
Had a stain/discoloration going from the top of the shirt all the way down.
You can see the outline of them through your clothes. I was not able to use them because of this.  Outrageously priced for what they are. Band Aids would work better.
big disappointment for a casio. Can't read the time with the backlight. Cheap feel.
ordered a 2X for the wife.  Had to return it because the sleeves were too tight.
Terrible quality! We ordered this at Halloween and it came with a rip in the shoulder area already! The legs were also starting to fray. The material is so cheap and super thin. Would not recommend!
Two toggles were broken out of the box!  Send two new toggles so I can fix it before I give it to my Grandson!!!
Cheap broke in month
"Need a no star.
I should have believed the reviews on this one. Defected zipper.  Poor quality even though it is gorgeous."
"Its okey, but a little small"
already starting to crack =/
"the material is cheap, I guess it fits the price. I should of payed a little extra for better quality"
"I purchased a pair of these Zubaz pants to replace an old pair my husband owned for 20+ years and these are NOT the same quality as his old pair. The material is different, the waist does not fit right (it's the correct size; it just doesn't fit right), and the pants are too long (he's 6'2"" and pant legs need to be cuffed). I washed them in cold water, gentle cycle, inside-out, and they still faded. I would not recommend these to anyone."
Fit way smaller than it should have
"I like this loose, natural fabric, unconstructed look. However, when I got mine, I saw it's SO not worth $45.  Really loose weave of the fabric, not flowy, and would not stand up to much wear.  I'm 5'8"".  Perhaps that makes a big difference but the sleeves on mine were not at all close to what's pictured.  Mine were barely little cap sleeves and the arm hole was somewhat tight.  I do like the style and construction of garments from this manufacturer and have several of their pieces. I appreciate how specific they are with their sizing on Amazon. This one just did not work for me.  Perhaps if you're petite it would work.  It absolutely would have to be hand washed.  Had to return."
"the color and quality are great - however it fit somewhat small in the thigh area. And if you have large natural boobs, this suit is def not for you as there is absolutely no support."
The bag is actually made well and a good material but the dimensions listed in the product description were so off. The bag is much much bigger than it says. It definitely can't be used as anything other than a weekender/traveling bag. Although the seller was very good with the return.
"Rather large, and not of the best quality."
Bought two. Never could get them to work. Husband even tried. No luck. Three then in the trash.
Too small . Won't be able to use it
Soooo big!
"Arrived with a dead battery, cute watch otherwise and if the new battery didn't cost as much as the watch did I'd be keeping it otherwise it's not worth it."
"I hate these shorts. I bought them for post surgery recovery; I needed something comfortable with pockets that was easy to pull on and off. I wanted to love these shorts. But the cotton is just so rough, and the uncomfortable waistband is very thick. They were definitely not easy to pull on and off following major surgery. I'm going to keep throwing these in the wash with each load of laundry and hopefully they will soften up over time."
"I'm not thrill with it, the quality feels a bit cheep."
"For the white shoes, the inner fabric lining is black but it actually SHOWS through in the toecap in a way that almost makes it look like it was stained. I returned them since it was so distracting"
Have several of these shoes and love them.  For some reason these were huge and had to go back.  Bummed.
"When you first put the sandal on, they feel good- and they are super cute. Walking however is a different story because they slide up your foot, causing your toes to hang over the edge. Something in the design just doesn't keep it on your foot in a nice way. I ended up donating them because i had them too long for the return period.  Unfortunate, because that money has been totally wasted."
"Delivered in July, belt was busted less than two months later. This review is written 2 weeks into September but the problem was noticed 2 or 3 weeks ago. Headed for the trash. Had it been durable, I could have given it 5 stars because it's a beautiful belt people wanted to get a closer look at. It's the binding holding the metal to the leather that failed."
"Having been soldier for 25 years I have seen my share of poorly designed boots but these win the contest for bad boot design .
There is a hard plastic like support in the heel. This piece is not attached to the leather it is just placed in between the outside leather and the inside padding.  About the fourth time I put the boots on this this support piece bent and broke so it constantly pokes and rubs the heel.  Do not be fooled into buy these boot by professional reviewers.  These boots are of very inferior design,  Additionally the speed lace function almost works.  If you want them laced tight to support your ankle then these boot will not do the job. The speed lace loops do not allow the lace to move freely.  As a result the laces will not get tight unless you snug the lace by pulling at each eyelet which pretty much defeats the purpose of speed lace system."
"Why folks write a review as soon as they get a product, beats me.  The true review is when you have adequately used the product.
We bought this boot for my husband at a mountaineering shop in 2012.  The nestfit is its best feature.  Other than that, the shoe doesn't last.
He wore it on and off after a hiking trip of 1 week.  When we returned he interchanged this with various other footwear and maybe wore this boot a combined total of 6 months.  The sole falls apart and can not be re-soled at the cobbler.  The interior cushioning breaks down fast.
For retail of $135 it wasn't worth it."
"I've had my eye on this dress for an extremely long time. Once the price dropped,  I leaped on it and I'm so glad. This dress is GORGEOUS!!!!! Green is my FAVORITE color and this emerald green is so vibrant and rich.  It looks amazing, the quality is amazing and I look absolutely amazing in it :-)!!!!

Update:
Sadly I wore this beautiful dress ONE TIME and as I while wearing it began to unravel from the back from a thread.  The front part begin to gather lint balls just from wearing my seatbelt.  I took it to my dry cleaner to see if it could be salvaged and unfortunately, they could do much because they said my dress was probably ""dry rot.""  This was very disheartening to me considering how much I LOVE this dress, seeing as to it's my favorite color, and the amount of money I paid for this to happen just after one wear, is absolutely shameful. I still think it's a gorgeous colored emerald green/black dress but........."
"When I receive my earrings, they wasn't as big as I thought. There 2 small 4 me. I like the earrings I just wish they were a little bit bigger."
pants get a lot of lent stuck on them very easily. Lots of cotton balls after every wash. Bad quality.
didnt last very long and turned green.
A lovely style which I really wanted to work out.  I have purchased several Vionic sandals which are so comfortable and these are by far the most uncomfortable.  I pay more for the comfort of wearing them all day.  Even after walking around my home for less than an hour I had blisters on my big toes due to the smallest beaded medallion digging into my feet.  Had to return but purchased another design which I hope will work out.
"cheap cheap cheap... look like scraps from the floor. don't buy.. trust me, I buy crap!! this is the crap craps.."
Too thin
The top strap rubs on your foot and causes blistering.  poor.
"Yes, of course, they are earmuffs but they are not adjustable so they are way too loose. It looks like it's slightly unfinished and they've started shedding. I got them last night and wore them for roughly 15 minutes today. Not impressed. Will try to pass off to my husband. If he doesn't like them, I'm returning them."
"Disappointed in this shirt. I have to wear a polo for work, so I ordered a few different brands, and I felt this one fit awkwardly.  I like my clothes a bit more on the form fitting side, so if you prefer your shirts a bit baggy this may be an okay choice for you."
"So, I got these pants. They fit well. I like them. I wash them again, wear them for the second time, and just as I'm about to zip it up...the zipper broke. I wore them once. Not really worth the money, try to avoid."
"Beautiful necklace, but my neck is now green... But I guess you get what you pay for"
The cone shape I do not like bought a different bra.
"Product does not remain affixed for more than 20 minutes.  One cup was missing some of the adhesive on the outside border.  I followed the directions precisely and the sides on both cups lifted irrespective of the fact.  I have used another brand made entirely of silicone that stayed in place all day and night and in the shower.  I clearly know how to follow directions and use this product.  The customer service representative suggested I buy a second pair at half price because, as she suggested, I would already be paying the shipping to send them back.  Why would I want another set of something that didn't work properly the first time???  Awful product and worse customer service.  I will not purchase from this seller again."
"Update 5/10 - I have worn these a few days now and both of them now slip at the heel - one of them comes off my heel completely. I loved them in the beginning; now so very disappointed just a few days later. I may try heel inserts so I can walk without them falling off. I removed two stars because of this.

 I am a size 9 with a somewhat narrow foot - I have never purchased a size nine that didn't fit. Maybe I've been lucky. So, these in size 9: One of them slips at the heel, but not enough that my heel comes all the way out of it. The other one fits without much slipping. They are comfortable but I will consider buying an 8.5 next time."
"I don't . . . it was . . . both too small and too big at the same time. I felt like I was wearing drop-crotch pants or some kind of diaper. Tight through the calves then just a mess of loose fabric from mid-thigh up. The waist was definitely small though, so I guess if you like walking with a loose blanket rubbing between your legs, this is probably what you want."
"Shoe is more on the narrow side, however it was more silver than gold. Had to return them since I needed a gold shoe."
"This bra is pretty, but not comfortable. It does not stay in place and while wearing for the first time the underwire worked loose and stuck up out of my shirt all day. The cup does not feel like it's properly sized and the band rolls up instead of staying snug. Total waste of money. Do not buy this bra unless you want to be disappointed."
"I own several pairs of Clarks shoes in size 11, so I was shocked to find these boots don't fit.  They are far too narrow through the top of my foot, and far too wide in the heel.

The cushioning is good.  And they are so cute and so cheap!  I only wish they were actually made to a standard size."
All wavy. Very thin. Cheap
"These pants definitely look cool and the cotton is decent but the front pockets are shallow for such a baggy pant, and my first pair started falling apart at the seems on the second wear...thus not much quality to speak of. Based on the level of quality alone, these pants are overpriced by about 20 dollars. The fit is off too: very baggy below the knee but not above. I have a 35-36"" waist with athletic/muscular butt and thighs, and the XL, which claims to be a 38"" waist, is not baggy at all in the waist/butt/thigh areas; in fact it is tight."
No where near as nice as the picture. I'm too lazy to return it but I won't where it. Don't bother buying it.
"A huge hole ripped in these the first time I put them on. I wear pantyhose for work, and normally buy the cheap Leggs brand at CVS and I have never had a pair rip so quickly. Normally I get a few weeks out of them, but these ripped immediately."
"No elastic in this, kept falling."
They look cheap. I returned them
"I received the wrong color and very, very cheaply made.  Don't waste your money"
Is ok.  But looks cheap.  Not what I wanted but it is here now.  So until I can go find one that is stiff  all the way around.  I will just have to use this cheap looking one.  Very disappointed.  Looks nothing like this picture.
The idea is nice but the elastic bands were unevenly sized so only one stayed on the foot while the other kept slipping off.
"Price hi, but Cheaply made.  The first tug & it'll be history.  I don't understand why so very many products made for children are made so poorly these days.
I've been ripped off again."
"Very thin material. Did not seem like
a quality product  Not a true size 8 - just a bit too small. Returned them."
"Way to see through, it's like not even wearing a shirt"
"the material was paper thin, these are not the same as the ""US Polo Assc"" with the logo on the front.  These are from Cookies.com kids.  The wrapping over the shirt says ""unisex"" but the sleeves are puffy and short, and my son refused it saying it's a girl's shirt.  Even if he liked the look, i'm sending it back because the material is paper thin."
"The front pockets are smaller the my older jeans. Money,keys and/or cellphone slide out when you set down. These jeans are cheap knockoffs!!!!"
"When I got them:  These ""slippers"" can be used both indoors and out.  They're my go to shoe to run errands around town.  Love them.

Two months later:  Leather turned into mush along the seams causing the left shoe to literally fall apart.  The shoe started slipping off my foot while I was walking on a sidewalk.  I bent down to tighten the laces and found the shoe had a three  inch separation along the top seam.  Further inspection revealed the leather pulled apart like a zipper opening up.

This is my fourth pair of L.B. Evans moccasins.  The first pair had been retired after years of use, two others have been reallocated as work shoes and the fourth pair, well you just read about them."
Runs small and shrank a ton in first wash. Dont buy
"These were very cute and sexy for five minutes. They fit my legs but the material is nylon like panty hose. After wearing them for a bit, the stockings would not stay up. By the end of the night, i gave up pulling them up and they sat around the top of my boots on my shins. If i hadn't been wearing boots im sure they would have been around my ankles."
"Pros:
-These are better than bare feet on cold floors.
-Keeps your toes nice and toasty.

Cons:
-They fit oddly and seem to have grown; initially, they fit well, but are now floppy and oversized. Weird. They feel like flip-flops because the back is no longer close enough to catch on the back of my foot.
-The lining sheds like crazy. Wearing these without socks leaves black microterry lint all over your feet. Seriously, I have Hobbitt feet after taking these off, I have to pick a clump of microterry out of the shower drain every day that I wear these, I even get little wads of microterry all over the sheets and on the floor."
Ithe quality was flimsy.  And to be a 4x and not fit me is ridiculous.  I were no more than a 2x in any shirt anywhere...
"I would not recommend anyone to buy this. It doesn't stretch, the material feels very hard and it fits very small."
"Although this bag has nice color, it has a funky smell and has made it unusable to me."
Have bought Bali bras in the past.  Have always ordered the same size.  This bra is way too small.
"Giant disAppointment! This is nothing more than a rubber bag. The detailed side isn't even 3D, just one plain painted side to make it look like it's beaded."
"I had my shoes less than 24hrs. It rained in Roanoke, VA today and my shoes came apart walking across the parking lot to work. I hope the seller sees this because I need a new pair."
"Didn't care for the cut of the slacks - too tight in the seat.  Waist was fine, length was good. Fabric seemed like it would shed wrinkles well.  Still with the fit not right, they were returned."
"Had to return, even though I ordered my size per the sizing chart, it was too small.  Fabric was rough, so I didn't bother with an exchange."
The foot opening was way too small.
Hubby didn't like the feel of the shoe.
"They are beautiful BUT  they run small,  The width, even though stated to be a B buy they are closer to an A.  I believe this style may be incorrectly sized>  I have several shoes by Chinese Laundry and have not had this problem.  The vendor notified me that I would for return charges, since the were correctly described."
"Fits small, gave it to my 8 year old"
"not only they had a very strong  perfume odor, there were long brown hair all over them! I received a used set!!!!!! so disappointing!"
"5'0, 172lbs, 36E, size 12,14. Bought the 2xl and the top was sliding off me. The neck straps were too close to the center, it just looked off. The bottoms fit fine but rode up on my cheeks a little.  Great color pattern in the purple snake print though!"
I washed these once and they shrunk to a small. I had to give them to my daughter.
My size was too large but I could already tell that the size down was going to be too small. Very hard and uncomfortable too. Poor cheerleaders!
A mess!!
This faded after a few washes
Bought a size medium for my mother who is really a size small but likes her PJs loose. They arrived well packaged and timely. Thin material but well made and attractive. Then fit like a size small. After one cold water wash they became extra small. After another as I have them to my 10 year old niece as the were so shrunk they. Ouldnt fit anyone but a small child. Oh well -chalk it up.
"I wish I would have been able to try these shoes out for a day before purchasing them.  They run small, so get the next size up.  They dry quickly in the sun tho, and provide protection when walking rocky islands or oyster beds.  They also do not scuff the boat, which is a plus.  The only downfall to these shoes that make me regret purchasing them is that there are little bumps in the sole area that is suppose to be comfortable (or massaging?) but it's not.  After walking for what felt like a few minutes my feet start to hurt and I have to take these expensive shoes off."
"Unfortunately, these panties are coming apart at the top seams.  Very disappointing because I loved them before that.  I haven't contacted customer service about them, because I don't want to try another pair again, since so many people have been posting in the comments about this same issue.  Very disappointing."
Unfortunatly the shoes are not leather as described but manmade material. The price is too high for this poorly made shoe. The smile line from one shoe was different from the other one.
My baby pulled these off his feet repeatedly so there is no point to even putting them on. They don't strap or tie.
Clown shoe big-even for Crocs which is normally sized generously.
The smell is horrible.
i hate these jeans. Looks good on the website but ugly in person.
I didn't like it. It looks better in the picture. I returned it.
The size is way way way too small. Not impressed!
Well constructed hat made from good material. That being said the crown of the hat is to tall and looks retarded on my head. Will definitely return this hat and will stick to my Barmah hat.
pretty pattern but very small.
Run small and not impressed with only half the boot being leather - didn't notice that from the photo.
I only gave this item a one star because I had to. if I could of left a message with zero stars I would have DON'T BUY poorly made
Not very comfortable.  I ordered some Sketchers walking shoes and they are very comfortable and  a perfect fit.
"I ordered the athletic pair. They do not fit like they are supposed to. It seems as though they are the regular fit jeans with a tag that says ""athletic"". They are a heavy weight pair that are stiff. If you're looking for an athletic fit, shop elsewhere."
"I had people compare these to LaLuroe leggings.  Pssssshhhh, they have NOTHING on Lularoe. These things are COMPLETLY see through. I ended up selling them at a yard sale for $1."
They are huge. Gave them away. I usually wear small so I expected them to be large for me. But they were enourmous large
This hat is ok for the price. But it kind of hurts my head. The flaps on the visor part kind of dig into my skin.
The quality of the fabric was very nice. But no way close to  One Size Fits Most... way too small
For someone like me who has a larger chest and an average body This fit a little big over the body and not at all in the chest
The skirt is longer than it says it is - nothing like the photo. The skirt looked cheaply made - would not recommend
They were to tight for me tried to order wider size not availible
broke immediately
"I loved how these boots look! However, they are very narrow, and hurt my toe because of the pressure it put on my toe nail. I had to return them."
Quality of t-shirt and singlet not great. Proportion of pants is weird. The groin area is too long. But price is low.
I have bought other haggar products and found the sizing true but this waist size was too small. I will be returning this item.
"They were cute - but wayy too small for my feet.
I ordered an 11WW but my foot was very cramped."
"The watch was bought as a gift, this was not a new watch by any means scratches on the glass part, no tags or serial numbers attached even the box looked worn-out. I am truly disappointed with this purchase"
WHO LIKES STIFF SHOES?  I DONATED THESE AFTER TRYING THEM ON...HOPE SOMEBODY ELSE FINDS THEM COMFORTABLE.
"It's misleading of them to call these shoes ""patent leather"" when the only thing ""patent"" is the lie! They're just plastic. Nice that you can throw them in the washer and let them air dry, but it definitely impacts how long you can comfortably wear them."
"I was very disapointed in the prayer bracelet.  I expected it to look a tad more attractive.  it is a dull color, like pewter that should be polished. would not  reccomend this."
"Order XL and it's extremely small
gets really discouraging ordering online when the sizes are so off
then to ship things back it cost more then you paid for it"
"It moves and roles :( it has a double layer material and the top layer makes the bottom role up. It give great support, but again, it roles."
Is not real leather. The run small.
"these were too tight from the start. I returned them.

I have other shoes from Merrell that are excellent."
I used all 3 parts of this pevonia product and saw minimal results. Will not be repurchasing.
Returned...too small
"Terrible fit couldn't wear, too tight and didn't want the hassle to return."
Don't think I would buy again.
"I was not familiar with X-Temp underwear when I purchased these. I was surprised and disappointed when these arrived. I liked the color but when I took them out of the package and felt the fabric, I immediately checked the front to see if there was a slot for a man. My first and only thought ... these are for women. The fabric is thin, slick and silky. Women's cotton panties are far more masculine feeling than these.

If some men want to wear them (and apparently praise them as evidenced by some reviews), that's fine. I don't. Ignore my 'Fit' rating because I cannot review without ranking the 'fit.' I never put them on.

Gonna use these in my shop for high-gloss finish polishers. I don't care to return them."
Material is terrible
Way too small for the size I selected. Very disappointed.
"Will NEVER purchase again very cheap, inside lining tore , zipper kept getting stuck so I couldn't zip it all the way down cards not very secured inside of pockets would not recommend."
"Whoa man are these cheap feeling. Material is thin and kind of scratchy, the waistband is pretty uncomfortably stiff/tight, and they're not particularly warm either. If you're looking at this because of the cheap price, you should also know you're getting a cheap product. I bought some duofold ones (which were about 5 bucks more expensive) at the same time and they are miles better in quality - warmer, softer, part merino wool, and comfortable waistband.

-Nicole H."
Sizes are a lot smaller then expected...passed it down to my daughter who is naturally thin and it still was very snug and uncomfortable in a size xl
Based on reviews I ordered my normal size 46DD.  The band was at least 1 size too small. There was also very little support so I will not be ordering the larger size.  Additionally the material was very rough and not comfortable.
"I was hoping this shirt would be more breathable than it is. It is 100% polyester so I should have know better. Basically it is a woven plastic shirt. It makes me sweat more than other shirts. I am 6'5"" tall, 230# and the XTL fit well. This shirt was on an Amazon deal of the day so I tried it because it was cheap. You know how your favorite shirts stay in rotation at the top of the pile. This one has worked to the bottom of the drawer waiting to get cleaned out and donated to goodwill.  I wish tall people had more options for clothing."
"Very cheap looking and doesn't stay up in the ear, as picture continuously falls down. "
"This is a weird top.  I had read a review that said the slits on the sides were too high and made the shirt kind of inappropriate for office wear.  I thought, I had a short torso, it will probably be fine for me.  Not so much - the slits on the slide of the shirt are extremely high, i.e. will expose the top of your pants as well as some skin.  The shirt is also extremely sheer, so if you plan to wear a cami underneath, you'll likely need to order one size up.  I returned my purchase for a refund."
way to small size was not accurate
the waist came apart after just a few washes..
Cute shoes. I had to send them back because they were too wide for her narrow feet.
I ordered the olive green stockings and when I received them in the mail they looked more like kelly green.  Now I have several olive green clothing so I know how it should look.  I contacted the vendor through Amazon and I did not get any reply.  I will not order from them again because of poor customer serice.  Atleast answer my email.
The reviews acted like ordering a size bigger would work but it did not.  Very disappointing
"Blue star fell off instantly, bent when arrived"
"the sizing is way off and it was not a mans zipup. Gave it away, just to get rid of it."
Much too big- I normally am a size 8-8.5 and ordered a 29 and the shoes are falling off. I ordered a 28 and am sending these shoes back.
"I read the reviews, which were acceptable, loved the print and fabric, so I ordered it. So disappointed! I'm a larger woman, but not huge, and my body parts are in proportion, but the upper arms were super tight! The rest fit fine, but the tightness of just the upper arms made the fabric buckle at the chest, so it looked bad. I wish I could figure out how to fix it because I really want it!"
Nightmare to figure out. Never really did actually. Terrible instructions. Did not care when the dog ended up chewing it to bits.
"The dress is pretty but it's much smaller than the other XL dresses of the same brand. I have a large bust, and couldn't button the dress. I'll be returning it."
The top of the shoe is too tight on my foot.  Not comfortable at all.
"These are so fragile, they rip way too easily"
I had to return these as they looked very weird across the crotch area. Bought in same size as all my husband's other Dockers.
Don't waste your money. These things are not unlike nylons. Totally don't breath. I got a handful of uses before they started to split at the seams.
Didn't fit just right. The cup size was not xxl. I am a 38DD and was spilling out of the cup. The strap top strap was very loose and easily unclasped.
"I have bought Asics shoes for 26 years. This is the worst pair I have ever bought. My current Kayano's are 11.5. They are terrific! I read the reviews on this K 22 shoe. I thought I allowed for enough room. My normal shoe size is 10.5. I was excited when they came. However, when I tried them on, they pinched my feet. I love the cushioning on my current Kayano's 21's. This 22 was flat. No cushioning! Two hours after I opened them, they were back in the box headed for UPS!
Asics let this edition out without Quality Control. Their reputation will suffer!"
Smaller and tight. Not satisfied.
I ordered a med which is my size. It was way too big. I got the blue and love the color but am going to return it.
"These were the most comfortable shoes I have ever had on my feet.  However, after 2 weeks of just walking (not even running) the webbing over the toes gave way.  I went through the process of getting a return authorization (within their 30 day return policy), paying for shipping and returning.  I never received acknowledgement from Dress Code Clothing that they had received the return.  USPS tracking did inform me that the shoes had arrived on 10/10 (5 days ago).  I requested an exchange of the defective shoes.  I had not heard anything from the company and called a non-toll free number today and was told that they had received the shoes but they would not replace them because they had been ""worn""! I asked then why I hadn't been notified of this and why hadn't my shoes been sent back. The ""service person"" said I should have been notified.  I was told that ""now"" we will send the original shoes back.  I was also told that there was no supervisor to speak with.  I have never had bad service from Amazon or one of their partners, but this experience is very disheartening.  I certainly will never buy shoes from Amazon again.  Zappos!, here I come!"
"Bought this for a trip to Europe. Before I reached my destination, the strap tore off."
Fit was too narrow. Returned.
terrible quality fabric - you said this was cotton - this is a cheap polyester!
Dont waste your money! The molding bar melt and the shape disappears. It won't stay on my teeth. I regret buying it.
"This costume was a bust! The headband was in pieces when I took it out of the package. The dress seemed well made, but the sleeves were several inches too long, not a problem I have ever encountered with clothing. The price led me to expect the best, $143.00 on sale, is a lot for a costume. Service was great, I was able to return for a refund."
"They look cheesie,  SORRY  Valerie S Watson"
"Grew up in Bass Weejuns, and was very happy to find these on Amazon. They are even marked Weejun on the sole.

Ordered Nov 2011 and was really happy with the fit. However, just like a few other reviewers noted, the sole (front center) and the heel (outer edges) totally wore through in about 10 months. Nope... these are not the only shoes that I wear. Matter of fact, I bought a burgundy pair at the same time and they wore through too.

Usually I'm in tennis shoes and the loafers only get worn to work... so just think about how poor the materials are given that level of use. Worn twice per week, on average, walking three blocks roundtrip (six total) on a sidewalk when going to and from the parking garage. Our office is carpeted, so there's no additional wear there. Disappointed.

Going to see if a shoe repair guy can salvage them both.

Great look, nice fit, but lousy durability."
the pants shrank during laundry
"Fabric was decent. Dress was too long, to my calf. It has heart shaped buttons, which I couldn't see in the pic. Would look suitable on a teenager but not a 30-something. Cute but not very mature looking."
"I have been traveling extensively for work and pleasure for 30 years. Some might call me a road warrior. In those years I have purchased a good deal of luggage due to wear on the mechanisms and poor airline handling. I was so excited to find lightweight luggage for shorter distance trips just to save wear and tear on myself. This luggage has earned the distinction of being the most disappointing luggage purchase.

I purchased this luggage a little over a year ago and can vouch for the fact that it is very lightweight and the frame seems to be holding up fine. The interior looks like new. However, after the very first use I noticed that the fabric was fraying, especially at the seams and on the piping. After several uses the luggage looked as though it had been through a war. Will it still hold clothes? Yes. However, the fabric now has fraying that measures up to 1 inch long in places. I tried using FrayCheck on it but it didn't help. The fabric has now worn so thin that I can't depend on it to protect my belongings any more and it is nearly impossible to zip a zipper without it getting caught in all the fraying.

I checked with a luggage repair shop that does warranty work for Delsey. They told me that the warranty does not cover the fabric and said that these bags use polyester fabric which is known for this type of breakage in the fibers. They said that there is really nothing that can be done and that this fabric is known for breaking down. They have recommended that I purchase nylon luggage because the fabric is much more durable.

Hopefully, this will help you avoid wasting hard-earned money on something that will have a very short life span."
Not true to size hard uncomfortable poorly made shoe
"I have never bought t-shirts so bad. Other reviews said quality isn't consistent, I should have complied.
I have never seen or ever bought for anyone such rubbish in my life. All the T-shirts were the same quality.
They don't feel cotton, very rough material, very itchy,10 washes later, still itchy.
This must be oriental large and I am a small guy. Pathetic show of goods. Too small, too tight.
Out of Principal, Amazon should ask this seller to go else where.
Today, I am sorry that Amazon doesn't have a minus star rating, at least a zero, Amazon should consider Zero or minus option, I am being asked my opinion,let me express it, in many ways I think sellers like this exist because Amazon is complicit,
Waste of money, I had bought a similar set for my daughter, she won't have them in her cupboard. I think this listing should be under 'people you hate'. Not worth sending back.

For this seller, its only the money........dont buy.
I ought to be returned my money back, product is not what is described. It is Rubbish and fraudulent (I have used the word Rubbish for the umpteenth time)"
"nice color, nice fabric. I normally wear a medium so I ordered an extra-large to be safe. Can't even button it.  this item needs to be labeled for girls, not women/missy. I plan to wear it over a tank top as a layer. could never wear it alone."
"This is an extremely light-weight mesh vest that would pose difficulties in putting it on for people with any limitation in shoulder or arm range-of-motion.  Seems flimsy and does not appear to be durable.  Rather than this safety vest for people walking pets or who walk in the street at dusk or after dark, I recommend the Amphipod Xinglet Vest (which is also available from amazon.com) for superior visibility, durability and ease of putting on and taking off.  See my review of the Amphipod Xinglet Vest."
"I returned this bra.  Like the Wacoal ""Alluring,"" it's very pretty and neatly made, but is flimsy and so low-cut on the cups so that my breasts spill over the upper center edges of the cups.  Also, something about the angle of the construction just doesn't hold the breasts up.  The size is not the issue -- the cup style isn't right for full breasts.  The back strap and hooks are narrow, and the shoulder straps are narrow and not padded.  This is the type of bra that works well for small-breasted women.  It doesn't make sense to market it as being for ""full-figured"" women."
"Love the way this shoe looked.  I ordered a size 8 even though I normally wear 7 1/2.  It was so tight that I couldn't even get them on much less wear them to stretch them out.. I sent them back and I am so disappointed..I wanted a plain black loafer with a thick sole for comfort to wear to work.  Almost got there, but the narrow width across the toe box just scared me off. I have had shoes that I have had to ""break"" in but this 8 felt more like a 7 in size."
color was dingy
Oh my gosh this large was like a small...I knew it might run a little but good grief.
"I washed this this and it shrunk, like a lot. I guess I could wear it, but the other thing is the hem on the sides is pretty uneven. Probably by a couple inches. I'll be able to wear it out camping, since I won't care if I rip it or get campfire holes in it. But I wouldn't buy it again. I'm sure glad I didn't pay full price for it.

 I received it at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
"I usually wear a large to extra large.  I ordered extra large and it fit like in between large and extra large. Was ok with the fit, especially since it was longer than normal which I like ( as they tend to shrink in length over time).  The contrast collar was also nice.  But once I washed it, it started to make those annoying little round lint pieces ( because the material is sort of a woven material..that is to be expected, but seems too many and actually for first time wash).. also there was a chemical smell to the garment when it arrived, and did not disappear completely upon washing, even though it was lesser.  I don't know if Alex Stevens is a major brand.. but based on the chemical smell, I am doubtful.  Wish some other good manufacture had this sort of contrast collar and fit.  May return this one, but won't be buying Alex Stevens anymore."
Underwire not very comfortable. Love these without the underwire!
"They're pretty but smaller that I envisions, and they have flimsy posts that bend too easily, making them difficult to get on."
Bag is what it looks like received on time how ever inside is smaller then your average book bag out side pockets are smaller can't even fit my phone inside overall it's okay
"Read the reviews, initially ordered a size up for my 5 year old (wears a 4 or 5 depending on the brand).  After a return, ended up with a size 10-12 girls!  The skirt is still really short (they don't get any longer just because it gets bigger in the waist) but for super hero day at school, it was fine.  She did complain of it being itchy, so in addition to the leggings underneath, we also tucked her shirt under the skirt so it didn't touch her stomach.  I guess it served its purpose but if you want something comfortable, you may want to look elsewhere."
"Should have trusted the reviews more - I normally wear M or L if the shirt has a tighter shape, so I ordered XL - can't even put it in... I think it's equivalent to extra-small or small the most..."
"lost stones almost immediately.  To replace, you have to ship it to China-that costs more then the ring!"
"I ordered shoes a whole size up and they are much too narrow and too small.
I am a medium width and after wearing them once, they already began to show wear on the toe width. If you have a narrow foot, I would reccomend a size higher. Also, not at all comfortable-simply a low grade dress type boot."
"There's some unfinished tulle around the lace that make the veil look cheap. Purchased primarily for photoshoots, wouldn't use for a real wedding."
i read the reviews & thought these were for toddler boys according to the reviews for my son who is three and wears a 10-11 shoe.  they are big enough for ME and i wear a womens 10!
"Weird fit, kind of bulky at the top, slouchy but not in a great way. Toe box area seemed very tight/small."
"Opened it up and wasn't working, pretty sad"
"Counterfeit Hanes product. It was normal white T-shirts with Hanes logo and not comfort fit undershirts. Also, the logos washed off on first wash. I have other Hanes comfort fit undershirts and the logos are still solid after 100 + washes."
"Too clingy and not flattering - and I really wanted to like it.  Also had it on for maybe 3 minutes before I really decided I didn't like it and got charged to clean it when it was returned.  I can only assume they want any carpet lint off it, because there was nothing dirty about me or the dress."
"This was weird, seemed very cheap and baggy.  Maybe I just don't have the right body for it but I thought it was goofy looking on my short body.  I think if you look like the model you could probably get away with it but it was still cheap flimsy fabric.  I sent it back."
"too large despite my size, so i returned it."
Didn't like this at all.  Need to return it because the wires in the back stick out... Like to humps
"Was so excited to receive this handbag. Used it to go to work and after one month, the handles started shredding. It was horrible."
"this item looked super large and i had to give it back because it didn't work for me, i also noticed that the fabric wrinkles a lot. so be real aware of it if you will need to have this item looking not wrinkled cause you will have to buy an iron for it cause it is insane."
"I was so excited for this costume. First orders a large and it was too small. Returned it for an XL which was not any bigger, actually it seemed to be the exact size as the large. The XL shirt/blouse that it comes with was actually smaller than the one that came with the large."
"It was just OK. I found my foot slipping off the shoe, so I returned it."
"Of all the dresses I ordered, I was especially looking forward to receiving this one. However, I am sorry to have to say that I do not know what was going on during the cutting process, but the bottom of the dress I received was NOTHING like what is shown. I do not have words to describe what I saw. I'll just leave it at that. No words..."
"Doesn't offer enough stability. I typically purchase the gt 2000 4, which are terrific. Did not imagine there would be such a difference in support. Can't wear them without feet aching. Plan to donate them. ... since I overly pronate in them. (Rhyming not intentional, but amusing nonetheless.)"
the stone was clearly a RINESTONE
"I'm 5'6/125lbs and I ordered the small, but it's way too big and a bit short. I want to love this shirt, but every time I put it on, it feels like I'm wearing a maternity shirt."
"From the pics, these look more on the blueish side; however, they are really just yellow. I wore them for a little while before getting a new pair, but for me they were just too big and had the whole bug eye look.  Disappointed."
I'd rather wear a cami.  This causes bulges and I'm afraid it won't stay up.
"Did not receive this top, was different than pictured."
"Had to give a star or I could not submit, I could not even give it have a star the fit is  terrible.  Way to big on the shoulder, arm length hides hands, way to long.  Jacket is this not that."
I am a medium but after reading the reviews I purchased a large.  I could not pull the shorts past my upper legs. They were super small! The fabric seemed light but kinda rough. I would not recommended these shorts.
THE QUALITY WAS TOO POOR.IT WAS NOT  LEATHER AS IT WAS INDICATED IN DETAILS.AND IT HAS  BEEN TEARED VERY QUICKLY.I EVEN DIDNOT USED IT FOR A MONTH
"Missed the window to return these.  Good for somewhat wide feet, but not extra wide feet."
This is very thin and offers no support or padding. It is really just 2 pieces of lace sewn together with the front having an additional thin piece of fabric. I need something that offers a little more coverage. I photographed it next to a Victoria's Secret bralette size Large for size reference.
"These boots were way to small for me. Being an athlete, I have bulkier calves which caused quite a problem with these boots. The foot area fit just fine. The style was okay. Nothing special. I could have ordered a larger size but I wasn't impressed enough to do so. I would rather have the refund and look for something else."
I was just getting ready to buy this until I saw the stupid saying stuck to the front. They need to offer their stuff without that goofy emblem.
This backpack was disappointing.  It was so small - I don't think it's suitable for a 2nd Grader.  Will return.
very big had to return
Dress  was very pretty but never was worn. We prewash clothes before we put on baby to wear. Dress was washed in gentle cycle and the lace around dress came apart. I recommend you hand wash.
Very thin material and shorter than a maxi
"I bought these to replace an old pair of Puma Smash SD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PUMA-Men-s-Smash-SD-Fashion-Sneaker-Forest-Night-White-9-5-M-US/dp/B01EGVL4J4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PUMA Men's Smash SD Fashion Sneaker, Forest Night/White, 9.5 M US</a>. Despite similar appearance and price, these are definitely inferior to the Smash SDs. These lack support and cushioning.  Look at the heel cushioning in the respective product photos; whereas the Smash SD features a generous, soft cloth cushion, this shoe has a thin plasticky strip. This shoe is likewise inferior in arch support and sole cushioning. Do yourself a favor and get the Smash variety instead."
"The only thing I don't like about this dress is it's shape, which really doesn't work on a pear-shaped body. It is wider in the middle than at the hemline and at the neckline, and it just sort of accentuates the widest parts of me, which I'd rather conceal. If you're on the thinner or athletic side, this may work for you. Color, fabric, length perfect. I'm 5'10"" and it covered enough of my knee that I felt age-appropriate in it (50s)."
"It was not pack good, when I open the box the stone came off, really was not a good piece."
was shorter than expected.  Returned it.  Hassle free return.
"I used these for one weeklong vacation and they worked okay.  I never filled them too full or washed them.  The second time I tried using them, the zipper broke on 2 of the bags and they frayed and got holes in them like they had been used for years.  Unimpressed.  I understand for the price point I shouldn't expect the best.  But, these are not good at all.  I do love the color..."
Do not buy this dress. It is not a maxi dress it only came to my knees. I tried to return it but the package had to be mailed to Britain and the least amount of postage was $88.00. Do not buy this dress
"I got the purple one, immediately after opening it for the first time the ""pointy"" black tip of the umbrella popped right off. Appeared to have been super cheaply glued on. I will have to get some super glue now, at least the umbrella still functions. I am concerned to use it in a slight wind though if that broke off so easily. I paid for this item in full and received NO discount like other reviewers. Buy at your own risk"
Giving this a one star because I received the necklace broken. Very disappointing.
"Fit around waist was correct, but around my butt it was far too tight! It's not really made for women/curves. I'm 5'9 and 140lbs so not out of shape or anything. Also very short pant length. But I am tall. Refund was quick and painless though."
worst sizing ever!!! 2 sizes too small! the 32 waist fits like 29! im normally a 31 waist.
Wife wasn't comfortable wearing it.
"The picture looked great!  A substantial necklace.  But don't be fooled.  2mm isn't very big, and this is a VERY skinny necklace--not at all what I expected."
"I assumed that ""straight fit"" meant a tapered look. the pants are much too baggy for my taste."
"The pattern and cut for this boot is completely wrong.  I was concerned when I excitedly took them out of the box and noticed the unusual shape of the sole.  It was too wide at the heel and then too boxy toward the toes -- barely foot shaped at all.  Trying them on confirmed the ineptness of the design -- wrong proportions.  The instep was snug and buckled oddly, and across the width it was a bit tight, then too wide around the toes. (They were too snug in the calves too, but I have had that problem with other boots on occasion.) I haven't seen a shoe this badly designed in terms of the basic shape since for decades, and those were 3 dollar plastic shoes. But this is not coming from Kazakhstan, the company is Canadian!
I am heartbroken because I fell in love with these after I first saw them in a store window a few weeks ago.  I then had to search high and low for the color I wanted in my size (Amazon didn't have it, unfortunately), and finally found it.  I still love everything about the way they look, but they are not $20 boots, they were expensive!  They are going back."
"Purchased is from Watchoss and was sent a gorgeous watch that didn't work. It is a beautiful and eye-catching watch though and exactly what I wanted so I took it to a very high end jewelry store to see if a new battery would do the trick. Nope. The mechanisms inside were just stuck. I returned it and then a few weeks later got a very move message from the seller about communicating any problems with them openly. I sent a nice message back. Haven't heard a word since. I was really hoping they'd make good on the watch and offer to ship a new one since they seemed to care so much and have great feedback otherwise. Oh well, with so many sellers on here it wasn't hard to replace the watch for an equal or better price point."
"I'm constantly tugging these pants down, very uncomfortable. But, if you can ignore the death grip on your bits, they are warm."
"This Meaningful Beauty kit didn't work for me. It makes my normal-to-oily skin too oily and more prone to acne. It gave me a bad breakout just a couple of days after using it. Some of the ingredients must not agree with my skin. Besides, the packaging looks cheap and the pump has stopped working after a week. Overall, I don't like it at all. It seems to make my skin worst. I won't be using it again."
since these are fabric shoes there is no give. I wore them out one night and hobbled around for a week. I just gave them to Goodwill
"They are falsely advertising that this ring is 925 sterling silver, its definitely not!. True sterling silver would be stamped in the inside of the ring."
The metal is kinda cheap and hurt my ears almost instantly. They look okay. Nothing wrong there. I don't think i'll buy them again.
"ORDERD  29"" LENGTH TRIED TEM ON THEY WORD HAVE FIT A PERSON WITH A 36"" LENGTH.LIKED THE JEANS FIT IN THE WASTE BUT WAY TO LONG IN LENGTH."
I bought one of these hats after 9/11 (I lived in NYC from 1994-1999) and am SICK to my stomach after watching the crackdown in NY.  I feel like burning it now.
"I was to play in a tournament in Palm Springs where it can be very hot.  Perspiration under my 38 delta delta bra has caused heat rash in the past so I was searching for a solution.  Unfortunately though I tried it when I wasn't playing and it stayed put, when I serve or twist a lot it doesn't, so it didn't solve my problem.  It also was larger than I expected in that it wrapped further around the sides than I needed or thought it would. I'm not thrilled with the little tongue that goes between the breasts.  It may however, be a solution for some if you need this when not active."
"It doesnt fit well, and it is not like what the picture shows. I am returning it because it is not worth the $40 bucks. Its cheap."
China sizes a waste of money
Had to give it away due to the size selected being too large. But the material is absolutely amazing and comfortable.
Bought 2XL wife for an 80s party. Wife usually wears XL.  Definitelh runs small. Doesn't sit off shoulder as easily as shown.  Graphic is cheaper and not as detailed as displayed.
"This was more expensive than the Champion shirts I usually buy in the same size, but the fit was terribly small."
"One of the two socks was missing the buttons. There were circle imprints where buttons used to be on the one sock. For $20 for a pair of socks, it's a little disheartening that these were shipped out they way they were. When I get back home, I'll be issuing a return request. If they had the buttons on both socks, instead of only the one, they'd have been perfect. Sad, now my wife won't have them for Christmas. I hope this was a one time thing with this seller and nothing consistent. If I were home...I'd have added a pic, but I think its pretty self explanatory."
Overpriced Junk. Another 'gotcha' item. The magenetic clip is useless. magnet is Very weak and bills will slide off into your pocket and not stay on clip. Junk.  I bought Two based on the reviews - big error.
I do like the pattern on this skirt but the material was awful. I guess you get what you pay for
"If you're large chested, do not purchase this bra! It does not keep your ladies in place at all. They spill out the sides and it does not fit true to size at all. The padding makes it fit even worse and gets bunched up every time you move."
One wash and pants shrunk so much that they now are above the ankle.
way larger than I anticipated.
i didn't like....
it must shrunk during shipping because the shirt did not fit at all. I think someone switched the tags there no way  it a 4 xl.. Dont buy..
They ride up in the back....and the front. Not a fan.
I usually wear a size 8M.  The 8M was too short.  I returned them and ordered 8 1/2M which was too large.  Returned these.  Disappointed!
"I'm sure they're good pants but I don't like the material, it's my fault for not doing adequate enough a research. Thank you though"
"Nice cotton.....however, it SHRINKS with normal wash / dry.
XL Tall shrinks 3"" the first wash a dry.
Would not buy again."
"My husband has only worn this shoe for 4 months now and just today it ripped on the side of the fabric. He's had other Skechers shoes similar to this one that lasted him for over 3 years. I finally convinced him to get a new pair and now he can't wear them any longer. I would give it 0 stars if I could since this is the worst quality I've ever seen on an expensive brand name shoe. Honestly, all he does is wear them to work and when we go out. He didn't do anything that would cause the fabric to rip and pull apart at the seams. Now we are past the return period so all I can do is write this review to warn others out there. What a disappointment!"
The hat fell apart in 3 months. Not a good buy
"the shoe to order is for a two year old girl that fits size 5, and sent a shoe to adult. the model of this shoe is clearly for little girls

This packet is sent to a p.o miami box which in turn sent me to Venezuela. that month is difficult. expensive shoes returned to them I received the wrong size

I ask her to help, to fix this issue. thanks"
Just weird material and irregular fit . For the size it was long . Smaller size would had may it to snug . Althought my kiddo is slim . It was just not okay fitting / style  for us . Had to return .
"this brand does not like long toes.  tried a variety of their shoes and had tge same problem with all of them: the toeboxes are always too short.  cute shoe, though"
Got a hole in them after 4 months of 3 12 hour shifts a week
"THIS LEGGING ISNT ONE SIZE THIS LEGGING IS CHILDREN CLOTHING I AM SMALL AND SLIM AND I CANT DRESS VERY SMALLER AND POOR QUALITY
AND SELLER LIES"
"I wear 34 waist. Have for years. These are supposed to fit to 35. Not even. They are max 33. Too tight. I put them up to several of my 34 pants, and they are smaller. Much smaller. I like the construction, and they look good on my brother."
Top is cut way small and bottom is way big. Not a fan.
Too cheap and big
"Loved the style, but the fit just wasn't right. I tried ordering previously from another merchant, and it was the same thing. So this shoe and I just didn't match up."
It provides no support at all
I could not used even i bought it as my size
"I found this to be much smaller than expected, to the point of not being able to even get it on."
"I don't have particularly wide feet, but these shoes were quite narrow.  The pointy toe made them feel even tighter."
"Already unraveling on the edges. As someone else noted, the ends unravel almost immediately and the knit is very lightweight. Not happy with the purchase."
Great and excited BUT BROKE in half in less than 24 hours. Not strong enough. Thin strip of leather broke in half. Super bummed. Otherwise it would have been amazing.
The quality is ok for the price but the size is too big. The one size fits all does not apply on this item.
"Although this flip-flop fit as expected, I returned it because the graphic on one shoe differed so drastically from the other that it looked as if I were wearing mismatched shoes."
"I have a few pairs of the Slender Secret and all of the latest ones that I've ordered seem to fit slightly different.  These sit lower on the waist than other Slender Secret jeans, almost at the hip, and they seem a bit tighter throughout the hips and rear.  I returned them."
So I purchased this dress with the assumption that following the sizing chart and adding one more size about would be playing it safe. I figured I could always fix any pieces that would be too big. However when I received it not only did it not fit me but it was at least 2 sizes smaller. I was very disappointed.
Very poor Quality
I would have returned these but life got busy and I missed the return window.
"Quality is very poor. Thread all over the seems, cuts of the fabric are un even. Fabric is very then. A not buy!"
arms very short and material incredibly cheap. Seams were loose and about to break.
The shoes are true to their sizing and comfort. My problems are not with the exterior durability but the interior. The outside of the shoe has take the wear very well and the vibram outer soles are are outstanding in any condition. Unfortunately that durability and comfort does not follow on the internals of the shoe. I the inner sole and tongue have held up but the area around the the bottom and top of the heels in both shoes have just fallen to bits. The tab on the back of the right shoe tore off with a slight tug. All of this from just pedestrian traffic on a dirt/rock road and sidewalks. Sadly this is not an isolated case as one of my colleagues Merrell's have done the same thing over a similar time line. If someone knows of a better shoe with the Merrell line I might buy again but for now this is my last pair.
Buy two sizes up from your usual size.  This one's made for skinny people.
This is definitely an overly small product. I would go 2 sizes up. I am typically a medium and I ordered large and it's still tight. Quality was decent. It doesn't quite look as cute in person as in the pic.
I have looked at this several times and finally decided to purchase. I wish it had been as pretty as the picture makes it appear to be. It looks cheap and the color is much darker than it looks in the photo.
Would have been fine if they weren't so tight on the sides.
"If the title said Haggar suit jacket, I'd probably give it a 2 or 3 star. But the fact that it says slim fit, I'll have to give it a 1 star. This jacket is not anywhere close to slim fit. I'm not a small guy, and this is pretty much a standard suit coat. You will definitely have to tailor this coat to get close to slim fit. If you are planning to purchase this thinking you won't have to tailor it, think again!"
"Too small if you are a B cup -- too bad, it almost was OK. (comfortable!) But I found I was bulging out on the sides. FYI,  I am 112 lbs, 5'4"" and a 36B. I am going back to Gap Body or even maybe Victoria's Secret..."
This shoe is designed with a zipper that does not go down all the way. It has a half zip on the side so you cannot get your foot into it as the opening is too narrow and the material is too stiff and is not flexible.  Literally my wife could not get her foot in so had to return it.
"Ok, if you like these kind of shoes, they are cute.  They fit decently and are reasonably comfortable.  But they have a strong odor that smells to me like gasoline.  When I opened up the box, the gasoline smell seriously slapped up my nose.  I thought that after a couple of days the smell would go away.  It is perhaps less strong, unless I have somewhat become habituated to the smell, but the shoes still really stink.  I got in the car wearing them and they made the inside of my car smell like gasoline.  They are up in the bathroom right now and the bathroom smells like gasoline.  Seriously.

When I did a Google search there are some listings about plastic products from China (like these shoes) being really smelly, especially since around 2005. The thought is that something about their manufacturing processes changed  around then.  One commenter wondered if the outgassing from these products is toxic.  There doesn't seem to be a definitive answer for that.  Another poster suggested putting baking soda in the shoes or wrapping them up in newspaper.

The bottom line is this: only get these shoes if you are willing to have and wear shoes that have a persistent gasoline smell from an unknown chemical or chemicals.

I would hope this shoe manufacturer could do better than to produce such stinky shoes!"
it is ok but difficult to wear the shoes
Zipper broke after first use
"I really disliked these glasses and was glad when I lost them:

Reason 1: One of the hinges was significantly tighter than the other, barely moving while the other flopped wildly about. I tried to compensate by tightening the screw, but that didn't seem to help.

Reason 2: The frame was irregularly bent. I could look down on it from the top and see that it wasn't symmetric. As a result, it sat funny on my face. Again, I tried to compensate for this by bending it, but it didn't really work out.

Reason 3: These were too wide for my face. This isn't entirely their fault since I have a smaller skull, but it didn't make me like them any better.

Good things: It is styled well. It is really polarized. Do these things make it worth throwing away nearly $10? No. Buy something else."
Fit is weird on this.
This arrived broken in the front. This must happen a lot because the box that it comes in says you should glue it if it is broken..I couldn't because it broke on a metal piece. I sent it back and got a full refund.  I would like to add that this is a huge and very heavy piece of costume jewelry that is very inexpensive and looks like it. Definitely not for a small lady--too big and clunky. I am a bigger lady so I could have worn it but it would have been very tight and uncomfortable and I may have returned it anyway.  It is handmade and is not smooth so things poke you in the neck.
"I wanted to wear this dress for a dinner date with my husband.  I found the material to be too casual for what I was looking for.  It looks and feels like a soft T-shirt cotton blend. The picture makes it look much more elegant than what it actually is.  The dress arrived a wrinkled mess (I mean REALLY wrinkled).  Immediately I knew I was going to return it because there was no way I was going to deal with having to painstakingly iron every inch of this dress every time I wanted to wear it.  I tried it on anyway just in case it fit so nicely that I'd change my mind about it but unfortunately it does not fit like shown in the picture.  Let's start with the neckline, it is not the low plunge as shown, rather it is more like a scoop neck T-shirt (just below the collarbone).  Also, the waist does not land as shown.  The elastic (the pictures shows a belt - not included) falls under the breasts, not at the waist.  You can try to re-create the look shown by pulling the top of the dress down but it will ride back up.  Lastly, the length.  I am 5'8"" and when I wear maxi dresses/skirts, I like them to fall right where the model in the picture is showing the length.  This dress fell just above my ankles.  On the plus side, the material is soft and comfy."
DRESS IS TOO TIGHT
"These shoes are adorable, but after only 5 days the sparkles are rubbing off.  It makes it look like she's been wearing them for months, not days.  I specifically paid more for these shoes because I was tired of cheap shoes falling apart quickly."
I don't like them. They fit very uncomfortable and don't stay on my face. I can have them on to take a pic but that's it!!!
Do not recommend poor product when I recieved my purchase only one shoe works so upset my daughter wanted them for a few months and so disappointed she can't enjoy them ..... 
uncomfortable and itchy.
"This boot wasn't what I expected.  The fit was fine but the quality is a little poor . I got these to wear in the rain,mud and snow because I'm a lady trucker. My feet were absolutely freezing!  They. Are useless in cold weather. If u just wanna keep the water off ur feet but temperature isn't an issue than this may be ok.....but if u wasn't ur feet to actally be protected from the weather keep looking."
I purchased these for a destination wedding in Turk and Caicos and they couldn't be more perfect.
How do I return these jeans? They are too small
Cute socks. But they are too small even though I ordered my size. My toes feel like they are going to tear right through them. I wish they were a little bit larger.
Counterfeit. Don't buy.
"I hate these shoes!! First the color was not as pictured. This was okay because they would still match what I wanted to wear them with, but they were still off. Also the quality of the shoe was poor. The wedge was already pulling away from the rest of the boot, right out of the box! They are not comfortable, which is a shame coming from Dr. Scholl's. They didn't feel sturdy at all and I hated how they were a platform shoe. I got a 9, but my heel was coming in and out of the shoe. However, if I had bought a smaller size it felt like it would have been too small at my toes.
I've been looking for a wedge bootie that would be as comfortable and stylish as the Teva Cabrillo Sandal<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Teva-Women-s-Cabrillo-Sandal-Tan-8-5-M-US/dp/B00KXDI7K4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Teva Women's Cabrillo Sandal, Tan, 8.5 M US</a>, but so far I've been unsuccessful.

Don't waste your money. These are going back."
It fits bigger than supposed to
Bought these socks thinking they were all blk howver only 3 pairs were...the rest got colored stripes 
Dramatically faded during first use (I noticed this upon taking them off and I hadnt even washed them yet). Its definitely a one use only item.
"Arrived quickly and good fit and breathable material the logo is a bit more than questionable compared to other shirts take a look also the tag in the shirt with the  polo name is crooked you can see in the picture even the letters in the tag are sewn crooked, authentic polo quality is straight clean letters  and no crooked seams, I don't know if this is real"
He couldn't even put them on they were that tight.
"I had high hopes for these jeans.  I even used my ""fitlikeaglove"" measuring shorts to ensure I got the exact right size, in fact they recommended this product on the app after I did my sizing.  At any rate, I assume the waist would fit great, if I could get these pulled up over my calves.  These are so incredibly tight from the knee down, there was no pulling them on.  I have tons of skinny jeans and have never had a problem that indicated I have oversize calves in the past.  So I don't know what is up with these pants and who exactly they are creating them for.  Perhaps my 10 year old son with super skinny legs?  They would definitely go over his calves.  Sigh.  For the record, my calves are 15.5 inches at the widest point."
"Terrible. They hurt. This is my second pair of these exact sandals... And they were nothing like the first. The toe strap is seen oddly in such a way that they cut in between and you absolutely cannot walk in them, much less stand."
Problem with the tongue on this exact pair. A rather thick seam on the shoe tongue makes a mark on my foot that hurts after walking in them. I don't have this problem usually. Must be this pair. Otherwise I love NB and collect the different colors and styles to wear.
"These were not even close to my normal sizing. It wasn't a width issue, it was flat out way too short. I buy way too many shoes from all over and I definitely think their sizing is off (or they sent me the wrong size)."
"I've always worn this model because it does the job for a reasonable price. But as a big-busted woman, I always have a difficult time finding the right fit. Usually require a few tries to get the size right."
Does not fit but with Amazon it cannot be returned.
"No bling from the ""rhinestones"".  Returned item."
"Didn't work for me so well wouldn't stay up like the TCH Brand I had had previous to trying this one out, I ended up sending this one back but it could work better for another person just did not for me."
"I am very nervous when ordering clothing online, and for this purpose i ordered one in my normal size of 10 (i am 5'1 150 lb, 38 DD)  and one size larger (as not all cloths are made the same). The color is beautiful and the dress is somewhat styled as pictured, the 10 fit perfectly with the exception of the straps, they were oddly placed and very long. The padded cups in the dress are also oddly shaped and placed inconveniently."
"Not at all what I expected. I expected joggers, these are essentially Capri shorts--made from thin, t-shirt material. I look ridiculous! It looks like I am wearing knickers--I am gonna wear them with my newsboy cap and start selling evening editions of The Post. Attached are photos of the product side-by-side with another pair of joggers ordered at the same time. You will note the HUGE variation in the sizes, despite this garment being classified as XXL and the other, sized as large."
"Hate it. Super hard, even wading through all the helpful sizing notes in the reviews, to choose the right size. That aside, I had hoped to make this a work skirt. No. Mark my words this fabric is SO THIN that I do not even feel comfortable keeping this for casual wear. Bra lines, panty lines....every little curve. Everyone will know where your belly button is.

Think Spanx might fix that? Nope, all the Spanx lines will show."
The is a hole on one of the T shirts. Did anyone check before shipping out?
"I really wanted a red/orange shoe for no reason at all, and I loved the side cutout which added a bit of interest. I ordered 1/2 a size larger, taking the advice of previous reviews, but even still they were tight around my big and little toe joints, just now they were super long as well. Toe cleavage is too much, it looks silly. Horribly uncomfortable I couldn't walk more than an hour in these. I wasted my money hoping that maybe for me they'd work. It was expensive with shipping. If only they fit properly they would be a lovely shoe. But don't waste your money trying to bother with these, they seemed to have been designed without any regard for comfort, just appearances."
"The item fit as expected but we hate the fabric. It is heavy and feels like felt. I guess it can work in a cold climate but it will pick up lint. My daughter calls it a ""snuggie"". Feels like a blanket."
Turned green.
"This outfit was cute but way, way, way to big. I order for my 3 year old grand daughter. Item look like it was for a 5 year."
Nice shoe but much too short in the length.  Manufacturers are cutting back on their sizes.  My foot still measures 6.5 but I have had to size up for hiking shoes and boots lately in order to get the right fit.
"They looked cheap and the sizing was off, so I returned them."
"Thin material, small to size.  I would not recommend or buy again."
This isn't flattering on my body type. I have wide shoulders and no waist so it just made me look more boxy.
They show through clothes unless you wear something thick.
Imposible use this
Returned this. It was awful. The color was more like a dishwater grey than a white. The fabric smelled like plastic.
"Have to send these back. Like wolverines, acceptable price, comfortable, last ok for wearing them for 11 hrs a day as a commercial electrician up and down ladders on my feet all day. However, it felt like I was walking around with someone else's larger shoes on with my laces untied.  After a couple of hours I knew it was going to be a long day and I'd end up getting blisters. I've had the same wolverine shoe size for over 15 years, so if you were to try these definitely get a half size smaller or try it on in the store. Have to send these back. The plus is they were easy to take on and off to let my feet breathe on my one hour commute home or on my breaks."
DO NOT BUY! I was so excited to get these because they came back in style but you cant even open the latches and wear them. Total waste of money.
This is a very thin plastic coat.
Way too long for a kid
"This garment, pajama bottom in particular, was made for a giant! The bamboo fabric is rather warm and should be with winter wearables.
I believe PJs should be a very relaxed, comfortable fit, a flowing drape, in no way constrictive and also feel good on the skin, silky is always nice all of which helps one to get ready to sleep. The size chart should be removed, useless, inaccurate, misleading."
"Overall solid good product
product. Mine had huge scratch down the bacj"
"I'm kind of confused about this ring...the 2nd day I wore it, I noticed several visible scratches, and please believe me, if I purchased it, I take care of it so this has not been due to abuse etc. NOW, IT LOOKS LIKE ITS 5 YEARS OLD AND VERY BEAT UP. But the amazing thing is the inside is still flawless with not a scratch in sight. This was a waste of denero!!!!"
"Weird fit! I own several Clarks boots and all have been very comfortable right out of the box. These are weirdly tight around the ankle area and hugely wide at the top end of the boot (highest part of  calf). So wide at top even with jeans tucked in I can fit my entire hand down the first part of the boot. Then towards middle of calf they are normal. I wear size 8.5 or 9 and am an average size 8 woman. For these to be comfortable someone would have to have a unusually thin ankle area, normal size mid-calf, then extra wide upper calves. Maybe these were seconds and that why they were only $67. Who knows but definitely returning."
"Too many large glitter pieces, just looks clumpy and cant smooth even with many top coats. Who wants lumpy nails?"
size 2 and below only...not one size fits all!
Lovely idea but not warm enough for NJ winters
"The watch is great looking. Not too big or small. CHEAP crystal! My boyfriend can read it without his glasses. I gave it to him for Christmas... Today is 1/4 , and the crystal is already scratched! Oh and he didn't wear it for the first 5 days evacuee he needed the band sized. His sleeve is always covering it and he takes it off to work. This must be some cheap really glass that Seiko used in this. I am very disappointed. One last thing... The information about the watch says ""Water resistant to 99 feet (30 M): withstands rain and splashes of water, but not showering or submersion."" How do yo genet to 99 feet, but only get splashed? Really?"
Very cheap fabric. The black solid fabric is not satin or a durable fabric. The lace is okay. Looks cheap. Sewing is good and so is the fit but Do not buy.
"The bag I received seemed to be high quality, however it was the WRONG bag. I ordered a large sized tote and received a small bag that barely seemed big enough to hold my wallet. It certainly looked nothing like the photo. Obviously I returned it but I'm afraid to order again not knowing what I'll get.
UPDATE:
Still seems like a quality bag but it's not what I ordered, a large tote. It's barely big enough to hold a wallet and certainly looks nothing like the photo. I'm done with this bag, too bad."
"The eye patch is an awkward shape, so it wasn't comfortable and didn't stay put very well.  Wouldn't buy it again.  The earring looked okay, but my daughter didn't like how it felt on her ear."
"I really like the color, but I have only worn them a handful of times and the fabric is already getting pills which is disappointing."
Very disappointed in the fit. Too big compared to another nursing top from the same company. The cost to return it is so expensive that it isn't worth returning. Sad customer.
they are the worst shoes I have ever had on my feet.
Insoles separated from sole before I could even get home after 1 day at the beach...very uncomfortable having scrunched up insoles in your shoes as you walk.  I ended up pulling them out all together which left a stick sole which sand quickly stuck to.  Also runs very large and wide.  So large on me I felt like I had on fins!
Horrible!!! Ripped already. It was the correct size but poor quality of product. Very disappointed.
Material is weird. This is definetley not what I expected. Size is way to small. Got xl feels like medium. Don't waste your time or money.
"Dont buy it. Apparently i have an extra long torso because it does not cover my whole midsection as pictured. I bought it in the size i ""needed"" and it was small but fits okay now. It was just not wide enough at all. It doesnt stay in place that well either. It rolls and bunches. It is not enough compression, imo."
"Honestly, I couldn't even wear these for more than a few minutes before sending them back. The ankle strap is absurdly short, even for someone with what could be considered ""average"" sized ankles. The ridiculous ankle strap made everything hurt and incredibly uncomfortable. When I asked the company, I would told there was no way to fix that issue.

The colors were nice though, which just made it all the more disappointing."
it's too wide
These were so small that I thought I had ordered child's size.  I will keep them and give them  to someone who can wear them.  I will not order from Layla again.
"My first pair of fleece lined leggings, so I was a bit excited. They are very comfortable and fit well except they are a little long but I can deal with that. After wearing them once, they have pilled/balled up. I washed them and of course it was worse. They are so comfortable I thought that I would just deal with it however I put them on the other day and once I walked outside in the natural light, I saw how awful they looked. I would not recommend these."
Buckle keeps making noise. Belt acquires shape it is hung in. Not a great quility product.
the clock didn't even work the wrist size was huge
Very disappointed in them...there where very nice when they came out of the box but a few days later they turned nasty when I had them on. Hade to throw away.
Bow is very small.
These cut my leg at the top and have hurt my legs for weeks. They should have some sort of binding around the top. I love the print tho...
"Not a fan of these... if they don't fit your foot perfectly, they will really hurt. My right foot seems to be slightly smaller for this shoe or else the straps are a tiny bit looser, and it makes them unbearable to wear. I get really bad cuts between my toes from rubbing. So disappointed. The shoes seem like great quality and look very nice though."
I first order a 7 1/2(my normal size) and they were a little snuggler so I gave them to my sister with slightly smaller feet and she loves them. Later I ordered a size 8 and they still don't seem to fit me very well as I can feel it rubbing on my pinky toe and I do not have wide feet by any means.
"First I never got to wear them as the stone wasn't adhered to the post.  But the color was not turquoise, and yes I know it varies in color - but these were green. They were much larger than expected, and super heavy in my hand, imagine what they would feel like in your ears. The scroll work on the post was cheesy and didn't even match, half of it looked like it had been worn off or not even engraved in the metal to begin with. I wish I had something nice to say about them, because I really wanted them and wanted to wear them as the picture makes them look super cute. But they went back because they were not intact upon arrival."
"Sole of the shoe is falling apart after only a month of indoor gym use. So disappointed,as this is the fifth consecutive pair of Asics that my husband has owned over the past 8 or so years. Hoping that Amazon will allow me to exchange them."
"UPDATE:
It broke after a month.  We paid for a new battery, and it still does not work.  My son has become dependent on it, and is heart broken.  The directions say you actually have to PAY to get a refund from the warranty!  Don't waste your money!

Original review:
We've had this three weeks, and it has helped my son remember to use the restroom.  But...the face cracked the second day, and the band is very big.  My son is a skinny 5, but the band is probably more for a 7-8 year old."
"Ordered large & wouldn't go over the shoulders, looked like a baby doll shirt"
"I purchased this belt and the camo belt for my nephew for a birthday gift. READ THIS!! These belts have a label on them and I quote "" MAN MADE MATERIALS"" these belts are NOT leather. they DO NOT look like LEATHER they do not FEEL like leather THEY ARE CHEAP! Had these not been a gift I would have returned them in a heartbeat! Too much to spend for cheap trendy vinyl belt...VERY DISSAPOINTED IN THIS PURCHASE!"
"Poor product quality, after only a couple wears the waistband appears to be giving out ."
"This petticoat puffed out like a toddler pageant dress. It was way too full and the skirt itself ran big. Loose strings everywhere and the material was cheap. No amount of washing this thing would get the stink out. I opened the package and was got hit by an awful, sour smell. I washed it, twice, and it smelled just as bad. I couldn't wear it for the smell alone. I think I'll try a different brand..."
Couldn't last a wash with the threading at the seam coming off ...
"I order number 9m  and that's what it said in the shoes, this one can be 10 wide the glue is no good i feel that i have to hold the inside with my foot when i excercise in my aqua class. I have to get another one =("
Too Small.  Very cheap.
This XXL is in Chinese sizing.  It came directly from China.  It's actually fits like a size 14 in US sizing.  It's very light weight. Not a warm wool winter coat.  I'm very disappointed and this is going back asap!
Arrived broken!! It was torn and the beads fell out already in the package... JUNK
I really didn't like these I thought they were too big and thick and heavy they look good but it just too heavy
Very stiff. Cannot use it.
"This belt looks fairly nice, but the sliding adjustable part is difficult to get it to the correct size so that it fits. The adjustable part is also bulky and not easy to keep in place once set for the correct size. If it hadn't been so cheap I'd send it back. Not worth the hassle and cost of shipping back."
"I wear ties every day for work, but my collection has been lacking a plain black tie for a while. I was initially excited about this tie because of the great price, but ended up sadly disappointed when I opened my package from Amazon. The material is cheap and the center stitching not only barely holds the cloth together, but is sewn in such a way that it pulls at different parts of the tie. When I tried to tie it, I ended up with lumps and twists in what should have been the flat front face of the tie. I know it's only a few bucks (that's what I told myself, too), but seriously, save your money!!! This tie will be going straight in the garbage, and I regret purchasing it."
"This robe looks just like a mans Terry Cloth robe. It is not form fitting or flattering AT ALL. Does the job but not in an even remotely attractive way. It's not floor length either, and I'm short."
Great color but to small
had to return because left shoe slipped when walking
"I like it but its way too small.  All my other sports bras are a large, so I got a large...had to send it back.  I replaced it with an Xlarge since I really liked the stretchy-ness of the material and its low-cut front...we will see how that goes. I may upgrade the stars some if the x-large fits, although the large should have been big enough."
"Pretty heels, run true to size. However one of the heels cracked and could not be repaired. I will not buy these again."
"ordered size 32  as that is my usual trouser size, but the length was way to short.. I was expecting  that the buckle would fit at least the first hole."
"It is a nice piece, with the exception of not being able to wear it. The""necklace"" that it is on is just a little too long to be a bracelet, let alone a necklace."
Did not like the way this waist shaper made my whole body look. The bones of the shaper were weak and I had no support.
"This shirt took a month to arrive.  It was cute and fit great.  I washed and dryed it on a delicate cycle, the flower came off and now there are places from the hot glue on the shirt.  I didn't bother returning to CHINA to get my money back.  Now I must either pay someone to fix it like it should have been to begin with or toss it.  Waste of time and money."
"Plush, soft, warm...but the stitching started coming apart the 2nd time it was warn.  Such soft and warm material, just poor quality.  Too bad, my wife really liked it and I would definitely have given it 5 stars!"
"Cute style for sure...slightly snug even though I ordered my correct size.  I can not wear it because it leaves fuzzies all over the shirt I am wearing under it, and I had to wash the shirt a couple of times before all the fuzz came off of it."
I was excited when I receive my package. But became quickly disappointed when it started to have runs. I'm returning my pair.
So very disappointed. Very pretty. Looks just like photo but it is  Way too small. Took in to consideration when the description when it says 57% expected fit. Ordered larger than needed. Manufactured in China. But still too small. Now I will have to go thru the hassles of returning. No fun. Did I say how disapppointed I am?
Hat is too full. Should be closer to the head. Just a cheap remake of a real op hat.
Super cute but unfortunately they broke within the first two hours of my daughter wearing them. We have purchased these before and they have lasted her at least a year.
Do not fit comfortably and do not look so nice on.
"I'm a fine framed, size 6 and the XL was like a petite XXS or a children's size!  I even own some tops from some major designers that are sized XS that fit beautifully...and I'm 5'10""!  BUT THIS WAS ABSURD! Produced in Asian and clearly sized for traditionally very petite Asian women, these items should have a size chart equating them to US/UK/European woman's standard sizing.  GORGEOUS SWEATER (thus the two stars)...but not much stretch at hems even if it did fit."
"These are loud!  I couldn't take a few steps in these without them emitting a giant ""sqeak!"" that echoed throughout my neighborhood.  Back they went.

These are definitely not for you if you are:
1. A ninja
2. A Secret Service agent
3. A horse whisperer...or a dog whisperer...or really an anything whisperer
4. A librarian

These may be for you if you are:
1. A clown (only for funny clown though, not a scary clown...scary clowns need to sneak up on people, it's part of the scary thing...like you turn around and OH NO THERE'S THE SCARY CLOWN HOW DID HE GET THERE!?!?!? The sandals would totally wreck that.)
2. Out of whoopie cushions

In summation: SQUEAK!!"
"Super cute online however, when they arrived, the box was full of sand. YES, sand... as if someone wore them at a beach wedding.  Further they fit my feet extremely tight.  I never knew Nine West to be cut so narrow.  I returned the shoes for a size 8 without the sand (smile) and they didn't feel comfortable and the leather didn't look right.  The shoe looked a bit cheap.  Very disappointed."
"Poor quality, two sizes to big."
Way too small for the size indicateed.
It is too tight. I wanted something loose fitting.
"The material feels great, but the only waist band stitching is horrible! The material separated from the waistband elastic on the first day I wore them, had to send it to the laundry to get restitched, if the company can improve the waistband stitch, I would give it 5 stars."
The Hoop Earrings looks bigger in the picture.  You need to pay attention to the size listed.  The zoomed picture is misleading. The earrings are hard to put in the ear.
"I live in FL and they don't breathe, my feet sweat. A bit disappointed about this. Omni-tech hmmmmmmmm not so much."
I'm about to returned cuz it was way to small my sister is medium side and I got it for her but when she try it on only cover her from part
"GOOD BELT, WELL MADE BETTER FOR A LARGER MAN. I AM 5 FEET 6. TOO WIDE FOR ME"
Runs small and boxy
The stone was not attached to the necklace when I received the item.
"I bought a large pair of the lighter shade of sweats and returned them. It was my mistake for not reading carefully enough the description, but I wanted 100% cotton, and apparently only the black and navy fill that bill. I have ordered a pair in navy and will report if they are truly 100% cotton when I receive them.

Regarding size, I am 5 feet 8 inches tall and weigh 156. That's pretty trim. The large size were slightly long in the legs (which I expected on my shortish legs) but still a big tight in the waist; also, the waistband is not fabric-covered on the inside, making it uncomfortable against the skin. These do contain a drawstring inside. The material is thin, so these are good for interior lounging and outdoor activities only in warmer climes. I may have to wear mine outside with long undies.

All in all, for the price, these aren't too bad. I'll update when I receive the new pair.

**EDIT** Returned the second pair. Label says 100% cotton and they feel soft, but are a little staticky after washing (usually indicates polyester and not 100% cotton). Regardless, even the large size is too small. The waist measures 31 inches after washing. How is that construed as ""large""? To repeat: I am 5 feet 8 inches tall, weight 156not overweight, not pudgy in the middle. Normally I wear a medium, but even the large size is too small around my waist. The length after washing was just right (30  31 inch inseam) so, again, how is that ""large""?

I'm going to order the extra large and will be back to update my review after trying those.

**EDIT** I received the extra large size (I'm wearing them right now). In no way are they huge. I'd call them large. The waist measures 35 inches, relaxed (they are very stretchy at the waist). The large size, after washing, would be okay for workouts at the gym; they fit snugly on my medium body. For lounging around the house, however, they are just too restricting around the midsection. The elastic in the waistband is strong.

While the extra-large pair are baggy (before washing), they are just right at the waist.

ORDER AT LEAST ONE SIZE BIGGER THAN YOU ARE FOR A NORMAL FIT, TWO SIZES LARGER FOR A RELAXED FIT."
"Absolutely not what I thought I was ordering! Some of the underwear designs included, the Disney princesses and Spongebob Squarepants, to name a few. There is nothing ""sexy"" about that."
kinda stretched out looking. Was not very pleased.  Made me look fat.  Very long.  Must say it was comfy though.
"These flip flops were attractive and seemed well made. However, they were at lease a full size too small. I was very disappointed. I didn't have time to send them back so I had to give them to my granddaughter."
"Comfortable, but really heavy to wear."
"Not sure what all the hype is about, not impressed"
"Too hard, they don't give"
"These are my go to socks, but this past order 3 of the socks had thin parts on the toe that turned into holes after one wearing (and not even a full day).

I am not sure if it was just a bad batch or what happened, but I am a bit hesitant to get them again now.  To have 3 socks of different shading (one white, a blue white and a gray) all with a single sock that has a toe hole in the same exact spot has me wondering if it was a change in the creation.

The socks that I got last spring are still fine with zero problems.  Not sure what to think now."
Heavy and not as nice as picture shows. Color of gems/jewels gets lost in all the goldfish colored metal.
"Nothing special. I ordered a size 7-9 for my 8 1/2 foot. They are tight and my foot hangs off the back. Footbed might be thicker than average, but they don't seem worth much more than dollar store flip flops."
"I like the look of this bra, but had to return it because the band size was too small.  I wanted to do an exchange, to get the correct band size, but there was not a way to select a band size.  The table exists, but no way to select from it."
"The topaz is very pale, almost white.  It was not what I was expecting.  I thought the stone would be darker blue.  Would not recommend this ring"
"As usual, it runs small.  Very small.  Made to be worn by skinny flat cheated models"
I order a size 14 I got a size 16 it's a nice pants but it's much too big a size 11/12 would have been just fine.
"these are a joke, definitely not the correct size. and there is almost no stretch at all. did not fit on my 4year old's feet. returning"
Absolute garbage!!!  The metal tongs will break off on the first attempt to remove a set of spring bars.
"The two stars are based on the faulty product information. I purchased several of these bags to fit a specific space in a car roof carrier.  As soon as I saw them, I knew they were NOT 18 inches.  Measured from end to end they were only 15 inches. That is a substantial discrepancy. I can't comment on the quality of the bags because I'm returning them."
"The socks I ordered were for my 4 and 5 year old daughters,

the socks I received are my size  LG 4-10.

They're not great. Thick enough, but have a 'loose feel' at the ankle and heel."
DONT BUY BROKE IN ONE WEEK
"I thought these would be a great replacement for earrings I wore so often that they finally could no longer be repaired. Firstly, the part that goes through the lobs is large and uncomfortable to me. Secondly, neither clasp held and the earrings were constantly in danger of being lost. If I hadn't already worn them, I would return them. Next time, I'll pay a bit more."
"i bought this watch and right out of the box it didn't work. could not set the analog. you have to set the digital time and the analog sets itself, but it wasn't doing that. i contacted the seller and he told me that's what has to be done, i knew that, but it wasn't setting the time, it would just go to some off time setting. so i sent it back and he said there was a restocking fee(crooks), and later he emailed me stating that they set the time with no problem and that it's just a complicated watch. oh really?, well, i think you're just plain lying."
It was very cute but the screw stripped after 3 days.
If you have a wide width foot order large size up
"Bought these jeans for my boyfriend for Christmas, so he didn't even really start wearing them until January. They fit & looked great on him. Unfortunately, here it is in April, and the jeans have torn at the back right pocket & starting to tear at the back left pocket as well. Very disappointed as they were not cheap!"
"I bought this, and it fell apart. I was opening a door and all my keys fell out! It's not meant to handle pressure, but you apply more pressure just by turning it to open a door."
"When I purchased these sandals. , I read a review that they would be good for planter fasciitis . This was not the case for me. My feet are hurting me my planter has desired beyond pain dice I started wearing them. I would not recommend for heel spur with planter fasciitis."
"if you have a kid who is the least bit hard on shoes, stay clear of these! in 6 weeks the front of these are destroyed!!! all the rubber at the toes are gone and now holes appearing clear thru!
expected better from saucony. the last couple pairs have done the same, although not nearly as fast. have been buying these for year but will need to find a new brand that carries wide sizing."
"This bathing suit is NOT true to size.  I was so excited to receive this today and I took it out of
The package and thought ""Wow, this looks small, maybe it stretches.""  NOPE!  It's supposed to be an XL, size 16-18.  Not even close.  It does, however, for my 12 year old daughter quite nicely.  She wears a size 4-6 normally.  She's 5'5 and 124lbs.  It was maybe a tiny bit big on her but not noticeably.  She doesn't want it though, so I'll have to return it.  Too bad really, because it looks cute on her."
telling me its a size 7 its a size 9 wtf???? its too longggg and idk how i want to send it back what a waste of my money
"Gerber brand onsies: too small. Thin cotton fabric. Terrible stitching. Never going to buy these again.

 My shipment was delivered with no issues. My Amazon Prime Membership made quick delivery even easier.

There is a reason Gerber onsies are rarely in a hand-me-down box. Or if it is, it belongs in the rag drawer."
Ordered a 3x to be safe it would fit and it was a more like a small
The shoes is too hard!!!
"So I refunded my first one because I got a large, it was huge. SO based on the size chart, I got a medium. STILL HUGE. Lacing it all the way it was somewhat form fitting on top because I'm busty but the bottom was HUGE. Looks nothing like the picture like that. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Maybe if you wear a 3x normally and buy the small it'll fit like the pic. HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED AND I DONT HAVE TIME FOR A RETURN FOR THE EVENT ITS FOR."
"I am very satisfied with this watch. It is performing as advertised and quite well. The only negative I have is the instructions. They seem to be written for a different model and direct you to perform functions that do not work with this watch. The problem area is with the compass and it's alignment. The watch compass seems to be already aligned. The instructions also directed me to the Timex website for additional information and procedures. Their web site is less then useless for this purpose. It's only use is viewing all the models of watches that Timex offers or getting repairs. I have found that Timex watches work and perform the functions for which you expect from a watch. I have yet to see what functions a $1000 plus watch does that the good Timex will not. Also, by the time the battery wears down, you can upgrade to a newer model for not much more then the cost of replacing the battery.

2018 Update.
The watch works well. However the band has broken; appears to have rotted through. I would not recommend."
"When we first took it out of the box and my daughter put it on, I noticed some of the leg bows were slipping out, so I had to glue gun them to stay in place.  Despite that, some of them still came apart after the first wash despite setting everything on delicate cycle!  The large bow on the shirt is also a bit floppy and I had to glue gun that to stay in place too.  It's a super cute outfit (hence the only reason for 2nd star) and my daughter gets compliments on it when she wears it, but it was a hassle to keep it from falling apart."
I couldn't wait to get these because they were a gift. I am so disappointed in these Frye Harness boots because they look like two different boots.  The leather is pebbley on one and smooth on the other.  They fit ok but are a little long.  I paid over 200$ with taxes and expected better control quality.  It seems like someone would have checked them.
REALLY SMALL!
"I bought these on May 27th, so I started wearing them early June when they arrived. I have been wearing them for about 28 hours a week ever since. Mainly short, non-soft carpet and concrete sidewalks (most of the time in dry, cool weather). At first, these shoes were quite comfy. The bumpy bottom has kind of a massaging quality about it, especially when walking. I don't run very often at all, but I do walk fast all the time. It's kind of a habit. The memory foam is quite cushy, especially in spots on the feet where there is less weight bearing down on it. It's still like that, and it what I like most about it. However, it started hurting my feet in late September, and it's grown worse since then. I don't wear any other shoes until my shoes wear out. Now I need to get new shoes already. In just a matter of 1 or 2 hours, my feet ache. I'm not buying these again, because I need shoes that last longer than this. I've had $20 Champion brand shoes from Payless Shoesource last 6 months, and I paid $52.99 for these shoes that lasted only 4 months. I wanted to get away from the Champion-quality by paying more and choosing a brand I once loved for its long-lasting shoes. But maybe I'll give Sketchers one more shot by getting a different style. You can't judge a company by just one product. You gotta test your... footing. ...Yeah, that was a bad pun. Sorry.
Two more things to add:
One: Once those ridges wear down like an eraser on a pencil, there's a high potential of slipping on wet surfaces like the white-painted stripes on crosswalks and wet, covered parking lots. I've almost lost my footing several times, and that's saying a lot because I have good balance and am careful with my footing.
Two: Inside the shoes, they wore out similar to how Champion shoes do, which is the reason for my foot pain. The sole sinks in, which is worsened by the outside bottom bumps wearing out in places, and certain spots get rubbed out and create holes, revealing a hard shell-like interior hiding just underneath the memory foam. After trying out three different brands so far, I've found that anything with memory foam will have that hard shell. Since memory foam doesn't seem to last long at all due to getting flattened by 135 lbs of body weight over time, I'm coming to believe it's the same way for every brand. And that's unfortunate, because I like memory foam. But until it's fixed so that it doesn't disintegrate so quickly like cotton candy and shoes are filled with layers of varying types of foam, I'm thinking I'll soon go down the non-memory-foam shoe route and wear some kind of gel insoles."
"I loved the IDEA of a snitch antenna ball.  This is not an Antenna ball ... no pre-drilled hole, made of hard plastic, not molded material for antenna.  Wings flew off on 1st trip around the block :("
"The handbag material smells awful.  Returning this asap.  A shame, really, as the size is good."
I ordered normal size my husband wears but they ran at least a size smaller before washing in cold water. Now they are totally unwearable as at least another size smaller. I do NOT recommend these pants.
"I wear a large in all of my shirts and jackets and this one I could not get down over my chest, also the sleeves were very tight.  I am returning this product."
This top is too big sorry a person who's small my mother can fit in it and she's a Xlarge
Cheap shoe you get what you pay for
This is very thin so its somewhat see through and very clingy
thin...doesn't wear well
Less than 1 month and already a HOLE in the bottom of the shoe
"On the positive side, these slippers are toasty warm on your feet which was just what I wanted. Here's the problem. The inside sole of the slipper is not flat, or rather it's puffy in the middle to make it softer to walk on. This mounding in the middle causes my foot to either turn in or turn out. I returned the first pair I bought because the turning out was so pronounced. This pair I kept but I have to say I don't feel very stable walking in it and will not do stairs in my house wearing them. This problem is a shame because the slippers are quite cozy and cute."
Cannot go by sneaker size. These run smaller. Order larger size- 6 mens sneaker equals 7 modi flip flop croc..
No pantyline? Ha! More like worst granny pantyline EVER. These things cut into my hips and give me the worst pantyline - and the whole point of buying shapewear is to SMOOTH things out. Really unhappy with this. I'll stick to the (overpriced but at least they work) Spanx.
get a size larger than what you wear
These shoes are very sexy and I was SO EXCITED to wear them! I put gel pads in the toe around that was fine... BUT within an hour of wearing them the backs of BOTH my ankles started BLEEDING where the back of the heel meets the shoe!!! I LOVE the look but these are literally the most painful shoes I have ever owned. 2 stars (vs 1) bc sexy.
The top part fit well it the mid section was loosr
It's pretty but it's not lined like the other pictures. The material felt cheap. I ordered an XL and a L but it didn't like how either fit.
Baby refused to wear it. So its a complete waste for us.
"Fierce shoes...unfortunately, the back where the wings are is too wide. Way too wide. Which caused my foot to move around way too much and made them super uncomfortable as soon as I stood up. I never even got out the house in these. Mind you, I have a slim foot, so maybe they fit better on thicker feet. I have had them for months now, have not wore them yet. I am going to take them to a shoe repair place and see if they can somehow fix them, but I doubt it. Such a shame."
"They are tiny and thin, which is probably to be expected, but one has the hole punched almost at the edge and is likely to tear through pretty quickly.  Going to have to return."
Too small bi am returning it
Clasp won't open so I can't even try this on. Sent back!!!!!
"amazon should check out the merchandise they sell. fabric is shimmery and slippery, not exactly pleasing for our time, does look like it was passed on from the '70's and is not cuddly soft.  I knew I had a reason for ignoring the catalogs this vendor sends by mail.  sort of leaves you with a black eye."
Fit is great. Had them 6 months and they are falling apart. These are poorly made.
Excessively wide and too short on the torso. Terrible fabric.
The shoe also started to peel as well....
fit weird. way larger than the last ones we purchased. even after being washed AND dried
"Update: 30 days later & there are lots of threads hanging & the elastic is starting to fall off the closure

Our 3-yr-old has only worn them for 3 days, but he loves them so far!"
zipper broke three days after use!  poor quality! boycott Chinese garbage!
"The center compartment, where the bills may be stored, opens on two sides allowing the contents to fall out."
"I like crocks so much these were suppose to replace the other 2 black pair I have that I've wore completely out, but these don't fit right and they hurt my feet."
Was damaged upon arrival returned for refund.
Comfortable but they make your feet sweat rubber material not good for standing. Don't waste your money on those shoes
"2(x)ist v-neck T-shirts used to be great, but the same product is now made in a different factory to different standards. I have a few of the same model of shirt that I bought a couple of years ago (~2014), which were made in Thailand. I just bought a few more (2016), and now they're made in Bangladesh. Same 2(x)ist catalog number on the label and same packaging, but the material and the cut is totally different. The new shirts in Medium are 1.25 inches shorter from the neck to the sleeve than the old ones in Medium, and 1.5 inches shorter from the neck to the waist (even though the old shirts have been washed many times and have shrunken). The new shirts are made of a much thinner, shinier cotton than the old ones. The new ones look and feel ""silkier,"" kind of like polyester, even though they're still 100% cotton -- I guess it's a different weave or a different thread count or something like that. While the old shirts were great middle-weight quality, these new ones are really cheap-feeling and are less generous in length (even though they now cost more than they did 2 years ago)."
"I cut the elastic on the inner sleeve, as it was too tight.

The bottom half of this jacket was toooo tight!  It ripped at the zipper to accommodate my rear.  Even though I am not male-bodied, I'm far from curvy.

Then the greatest indignity of them all: an hour in to working outside, it had soaked through.  This jacket is an embarrassment to workwear.  And I spent the rest of my day soggy AF, resentfully watching the jacket take on more water.  

But this jacket is probably okay if you want to stay dry between your car and the grocery store in light rain."
Size run very small I give it to someone else....:(
"The boot definitely runs small.  I got a 1/2 size bigger.  Anyway, they are not as nice looking as they seem on the picture.  Plus mine were scratched on one side.  I returned them"
"This thing started dropping 1 inch black hairs everywhere the minute I opened the bag.

This thing sheds more than my dog. It's going back!!

I wouldn't trust this thing near my Fedora."
"disappointed, to short I am 5'6"
I return it because the arm length was a little short. The fabric material is okay for the price
they fit big and did not hold up well after washing.
"I liked this ring when I got it but it turned black the 1st time I went swimming in my pool. I contacted them & they responded ""when jewelry hits any kind of material like chlorine or other material in salt sea or pool, it will tarnish, no worry just return for full refund"". Oh well I bought the Sterling Silver Hawaiian Plumeria Flower Adjustable Toe Band Ring instead & love it."
"These definitely run small. I am hesitant to order a size larger, though, without trying them on in a store first to see how they fit. If you are typically a half size kinda person, you may wanna find these in person and try them before just ordering online. They are super coushy, but I'm returning them because I can't stand my heel being at the edge of the shoe. Kind of a bummer!"
"I was so in love with the blazer in the picture. It arrived quickly, but.... It's definitely more of a bright, neon, highlighter yellow color. ""Costume-y"" is the word I'd choose. Actually, when I went to UPS to return it, the lady asked if it was for a costume... -____- also, very small. For the price I thought I'd give it a shot. I wear a 12-14, if I'm lucky, a 10. I ordered XX-L and it was not happening. Also, unfortunately, it cost more to ship this back than the blazer itself. I'll have to see what I can do with it (sell/donate/use for material). I must add that the material isn't terrible, though..."
They tore in the crotch the very first time I wore them.
"Shirts are NOT heavy duty....
No cuff on the sleeves....just a hem... very cheaply made.
Fabric is not very soft at all...
Yes, they will shrink , order larger than you wear."
"Ordered in two colors, both same issue! EXTREMELY SMALL! Are these made to fit Fourth Graders or Women?"
About 3 sizes to small
"The shirt says 2XL; however, it is about the same size or a little smaller than my son's men's size L shirts.  I love John Deere, but this shirt is very small.  I would not be surprised if this is a counterfeit, but it fits my wife and she likes it; so, we will keep it."
The glove fits fine but there is not enough gel to even bother wearing them!  These replaced a good pair I lost - wish I would lose these!
It was beautiful.  It lasted through 2 wearings.
"Too small, order a size up!"
"Got this swimsuit and it looked really nice, but after the first time trying on, it fell apart. The stitching began coming undone, and I'm waiting on my refund to take place."
Nope
"Didn't fit well, too small. Didn't feel comfortable enough to even bother ordering a larger size so I just returned it. First UGG product I ever had problem with."
"This dress is a cheat replica from Artka clothing. You can find this brand also here in amazon. The company is of Chinese designers. I have personally odered from them 4 dresses and they are beautifully done. Just make sure to check their sizing carefully. The real deal is better than this rip off. However, Artka designs are a bit pricier, but you are getting your money's worth. I hope this helps."
I returned these shoes. The toe area was too narrow but the rest of the shoe was a good fit. The quality was not as expected for the high price paid.
These are nice pants but they are not true to size at all.
Not great quality and zipper doesn't always stay closed.
"This became very uncomfortable after only 15 minutes or so. It didn't take me long to remove the mustache and when I did, I had a very light rash that was beginning to develop."
"Ariat used to be my favorite shoe, reliably well made and comfortable.  Quality has suffered from production in China - material degradation, fit no longer consistent, too heavy a shoe now.  Just not good.  So disappointing!  I gave my shoes away after two wears!  What a waste of money!"
"I was excited to get these shoes, but they are incredibly uncomfortable. I won't wear them, but I'm sure it's too late to return them. I'll give them to someone who may like them. They're really clunky, heavy shoes."
"After seeing other reviews I ordered a large when I normally wear a medium.  It was still too small everywhere.  Additionally, the fabric was very cheap, sheer and nubby- not the smooth knit fabric I expected."
The left shoulder and sleeve is not sewed correctly and is not  symmetrical to the right side. The left shoulder extends out to a point and looks terrible!!
"Very disappointed with these. I purchased them for work (law enforcement) and with just one shift of wearing them, my feet have never been so uncomfortable. It has nothing to do with breaking them in, but just the overall fit of the shoe. Maybe if you have feet of a hobbit youll like them. My feet were so pained from them, I had to take off my next shift. Thanks, seller!"
discolor the fabric washed in his first two very poor quality sizes shrank
Super cheap feeling. Retuned.
Was smaller than expected in the bust and shoulders.
Good material - very soft.  Very High waist.  I ordered medium and was sent a large.  I did not reorder since I found a more inexpensive 100% bamboo briefs.
This corset was not what was advertised. They claimed that it had steel boning when in fact the only steel bones were two down the front- the rest were plastic which warps very quickly. The hardware fell apart when I tried to fasten it. I would not recommend this product.
Shirt is stretchy and and sewn well.  The shirt would be perfect if it wasn't so small.  I ordered two sizes larger and the shirt feels like it's two sizes too small.
No variety...all white
"Item is not how it looks in the photo. In the photo it looks as if it is a trenchcoat style coat with a tux style collar. It is not. It is a tailcoat, cut in the regular Italian tailcoat style with pointed tails and shorter than depicted. The package also says that it includes 3 items, coat, pants and bow tie, but the bow tie was not in the package. Not what I wanted at all."
"The shoe was nice but too wide, had to return."
These socks still went down into my shoes
"I used this on the toe area of some running shoes that had come unglued. I used a clamp to hold the joint tight for a day of drying, but it quickly started to separate. This was a was of money on my shoes.  It might hold in a non-flexing area, but I would not use it where you shoe flexes."
I never have worn these shoes because they run alittle small. They make you look kind of foolish when you have them on and walk around with them.
This mask was so CHEAPLY Made. I have seen other Horse Masks and I have never seen one as flimsy as this. Maybe thats why it was a Daily Deal.lol. Ohh and You Can Not See out of it because its so flimsy its always moving.
They are a bit smaller than any of my bra backs..had to crimp the end of the bra to line up w/the hooks on the extender.
"The eyelets on the back of the corset are completely unevenly spaced and aren't even in a straight line, which makes a proper lacing and fit impossible. Will be returning."
Tarnished within the first wear. Wish I had worn them before my return date was over.
This pair is tighter than my other Calvin Klein Corduroys. Perhaps it was just this pair.
"i hate this, it's so cheaply made, such bad quality, mask looks like it's gonna fall apart, machette too small"
"I loved them when they arrived and tried them on  .. WOW so sexy .... so much so I brought them in another color that day  .. i should have waited.  On my first wear of them the top layer of fabric started flaking off!  Just from sitting in the car on the leather seats to get to the restaurant! SO embarrassing!  Thank goodness the restaurant was dark - By the end of the night (which was simply a dinner date) you could see sections of the 'leather look' missing completely on the bottom. Embarrassed and very disappointed! (I'm 5'6"" 118lbs)"
"Cheap material as compared to purchasing them from other stores. Easily snags, tears."
All bra hooks flew off after first wash
I do not like it. It did not fit right
"It seems as though this cardigan is made for a rather stubby individual. The length is a bit too short on the sleeves and torso, yet the the sleeves are very baggy and not fitted at all. The color and material are fine and as advertised, but I will still be returning due to the odd fit."
I was expecting it to feel softer. Wore it once and it felt rough and uncomfortable. Plus it feels short on my torse and navel. I'm already a size small but this was tighter than I expected.
Ugly! Horrible! It came folded and won't fold out into a good shape! You get what you pay for!
Warm gloves for big hands but the liner separated from the glove so now when I take them off I have to rearrange the inner liner in the fingers. They also don't work with touch screens
These run so small I can't even get them on. I wear a size 12 and the one size doesn't go that high apparently! Too bad I like them with the zipper they were cute.
"This is real flimsy not a whole lot you can do with it, maybe keep tools in or something?"
"I love Sanuk shoes, but the straps are way too thin and close to the sole to be comfortable. They dig in and make it painful on the top of your foot. I do have a high arch, so that may be part of the problem, but with the platform, a bigger and higher strap would make it WAY more comfortable.  I've worn once and haven't tried again...too painful to even see if they'll stretch. :-("
"the size fit well. i returned it because it looked cheap, and it was too baggy from the ankle. it looked weird when i put it on."
Beautiful but heavy and the straps are too short for putting on your shoulder
Super cheap and almost transparentI sent it back.
Not true to size. So small. I was so disappointed. I usually wear a medium and am a size 8/10. they would not even go all the way on. The pants were so tight. I bought a 2nd pair hoping they would fit but had the same situation.  I was really disappointed.
My daughter can't really walk in these. They are cheap so we're using them for dress-up.
"I loved these when i put them on, but after 2 wears, there's a big hole on the back of my leg. I'm so bummed since they're so expensive. I haven't done anything out of the ordinary and haven't been snagged on anything :("
Very nice looking but very small.  I put it in my daughter's room to see if she wants it.  She usually wears between a medium and large depending on the cut. A 2XL should be way to big for her but it is very small
"I give it 2 stars, because it arrived with a dead battery. I don't know if it works yet, I have to replace the battery on a brand new watch. Service here is not so good."
Strap broke first use
Small and oddly proportioned.
"THIS PRODUCT DOESNT DESERVE EVEN ONE STAR (but I had to select it n order to submit my review!) I'm so disgusted that THESE BOOTS R SO FAKE! It's TOTALLY obvious to the naked eye, u just can't tell from their pic. Real Timbs r much heavier, have 4 rows of stitching (instead of 2, nice try) & r of better quality (leather/suede/nubuck) & also weatherproof. I'm not sure what fabric these r made of but it's cheap and the ones I received all appear to b wiped off which is weird because I ordered 3 pair from 3 different groups: toddler, little kids & big kids. Maybe if this were my first time owning a pair i could've been fooled but then again they're so cheaply made I strongly doubt it! I foolishly purchased these even after seeing another reviewer have a complaint of their boots separating after just 2-3 wears; I just thought maybe that individual pair was defective. I should've known better since Ive ALWAYS paid way more for ALL of my other Timbs. I just saw the price & thought they were too good of a deal to pass up especially since Timberlands prices have skyrocketed ridiculously this past year. I spent slightly less than $160 on 3 pair of these so I initially saved about $80-$100 total but what's the point when I'm gonna end up spending more to replace them when they fall apart?! I'm disappointed because I anxiously awaited my package for nearly a week and crap is what arrived. If u have never owned Timberland boots before then I suggest u go to an authorized store that sells them so u can at least feel & see what type of boot U should b receiving when ordering online. If u have Timbs then it won't take u but a second to spot these knockoffs. I received the 3 pair that I purchased for my loved ones today and 3 pair r going rite back TODAY!!!!!!! I wasted my time but I WILL NOT waste my money. Dont b like me by ignoring the reviews and buying these anyway. Buyer beware unless u just don't care!!!!!!!"
"Cheap,but fits...."
large tear on the right side of the knee! Missed the sewing process there! Waiting on refund
"I have several pairs of UA winter socks. They are some of the best boot socks I have every worn. Having this experience, I decided to try these socks for summer. They suck. They are completely falling apart."
KEEP YOUR MONEY.CHEAP AND RUNS TOO SMALL
"This knitted sweater was extreamly too thin and too small.  I was so disappointed.
Will never make that mistake again.
I purchased it for myself.  The front is too short too.
Just not pleased with this purchase at all."
Way too small.  I purchased the X-Large but they run so small that it left me with a muffin top.  I typically wear a size 10-12
Product fits like Medium and not xl
"While comfortable, these Jockey panties are not durable. They appear to be made to fall apart. Adhesive from pads tear them, and the normal delicate wash cycle tears them easily. One pair had a rip after only two washes. We have other older french cut jockey panties that are going strong after hundreds of washes, and these get eaten in as few as two. If they want to make them more like ""fast fashion"" and less durable, the price needs to drop by about 75%, otherwise they have lost a 25-year loyal customer."
"the way this watch is portrayed is totally different from how it actually is, it is not as golden as displayed , its not a good product at all"
"I actuall love the necklace, but after only 2 wears, the leather strap broke! Very disappointed."
I returned this product due to the low quality of its craftmanship. If is clearly a chinese cheap replica of a Shemagh
"They are listed at size 11 but I later discovered that they are 41's, not 42 as is the U.S. size chart. My friend, who wears a 10, tried them on and they were even too small for her - these are probably about an 9 or 9 1/2."
Serves its purpose but made cheaply and ripped
looks very cheap. Has a shiny look to it that i didn't care for. returned it immediately
The elbows were in front
"I love the pants I think they're great and they fit well. However, they don't last. I wear them at work and I guess I'd beat them up a little bit but  but the fabric  Wears out where I sit and rub up against things. I end up with holes. And that is disappointing the fabric is too thin."
gem was chipped and missing the small crystal covering the hole was missing
Very cheap looking product and came broken .
This shoe did not meet my needs.
"I want to say first I'm disappointed they didn't post my review on their website, it was confirmed but it never appeared even a week later, so they seem to be censoring negative reviews. Anyways, the construction and warmth are spot on, my problem was the seam across the toes was abrasive and irritating I could feel it constantly when walking, standing or lounging at home with out shoes it was alright. I own their light cushion socks that come with what they call ""true seamless"" technology, which is great, and it's sad to see them not implement it into these, a 25$ pair of socks, why, I have no clue. I sent them back to them for a refund, based on their unconditional comfort guarantee, still waiting for them to contact me back.
Update: They did refund me in the way of store credit, so good on them."
It used to be Aerosoles were a slam dunk for me. I ordered the wide width and still would only be able to wear these with hose or nylons. They were really snug. Plus I have to pay to return them.
"Not at all supportive, like I was hoping. I'm not sure what the point is of wearing these? They keep your upper things from rubbing together, but that's about it."
The top is too wide. I can't even walk for 5 min without my socks being pushed down because my foot is not fixed in these boots.
"These looked really different from how I was expecting... I got the Taupe, they were far more red and the leather was a bit too shiny for my taste. Plus, they ran on the tight and narrow side. Was hoping to love them! I returned instead - the seller was very accommodating about sending back."
Almost reaches my knee no where near thigh high.
"A big Dr Who fan, was shopping for a shirt to run a race. Item sizing instructions were accurate (ordered up a size). The item arrived in the expected time. The material is a soft cotton t-shirt, the blue color is brighter than expected. Was rather disappoInted with the logo, it was too large for the shirt front I returned the item because of this and the color. I am hopeful a slightly redesigned logo and darker blue color shirt will be available soon."
Does not look anything like the pic its a waste
Fit much larger than expected.  Material is scratchy.  Returned.
"It is a little bit to large and I do not like the fabric, poor quality."
Crap. Took them off the clean them an the star fell off. Too bad they were cute.
"I sized up a couple of sizes, and it was still too small in the chest area.  The material is SO SEE-THROUGH even with the ""liner.""  The material feels super cheap, and I doubt I would have kept it even if it did fit me properly.  Pass on this dress, ladies.  I really wanted this to work because of the other reviewers loving it, but unfortunately this was a dud for me."
They are way too tight
"liked the style. thought it was a great purchase, until the pin on the reversible belt came undone.
glued it. it lasted another 3 mos.
too bad. nice looking belt, but won't hold up to anything you need to hold up.
i wear a size 32 pants and got a 34 belt. Seemed like a good fit.
sorry it didn't work out"
Horrible. Don't buy.  Very hard to program. Can not recommend more strongly against this. I thought it was a nice looking watch which it is but programming is a nightmare.
Worthless. Didn't make it to London. Found it ripped when collecting at baggage claim. Sad. Sad sad
"I think for things like this they should improve the way they size it. Also, the material is sort of cheap feeling and is not breathable. I wore it once and threw it away. Sorry - just not a good product."
"Stone was missing when I opened it! not as good quality as I thought.  Stons were great color, even across the bracelet, and clean.  The silver bracelet was weak, and the clasp was hard to get open.  Anyway, I am sending it back.  To much money to let it slide."
Don't even look like the picture with the model in it... now the pictures with just the scarf are closer.  It has a more purple and green look to it.  I will be re gifting this to someone who would prefer the color pallet.  Disappointed.
"It is so disappointing.  I purchased these boots and was so excited because I had seen them in several stores and LOVED THEM.  They arrived today.  I got them out of the box and there was ink or some sort of dark blackish stains on the fringe of both boots and what appears to be maybe a glue stain on the fringe on just one.  The bottom layer of the fringe is a lighter color.  I have seen these boots in three stores and decided to get them from Amazon because I had a credit and they were cheaper.  They are lighter in color than the ones in the stores, but I could have dealt with that.  The stains are just not acceptable though. I'm afraid to exchange because I don't want to return a second time.  Tempting to try again at this price but......  I just don't understand why they came like this.  Maybe they are seconds or something."
I can not recommend it
"Never wore toeless hose before so I was looking forward to wearing these. Short lived excitement because as soon as I got them on they ran. All I did was walk to the bathroom and I felt it go.  I wasted $20 on a pair hose which I wouldn't normally do, and had to be at a wedding.  No time to buy another pair so I grabbed my foundation and poured it on both legs to even out the tone of my naked legs. Worked great in a pinch. I may try another brand but Donna Karen's brand of hose was a total disappointment.  Never again."
"Update 11/11/2016
Now on pair.  Still awesome tint for viewing, but I agree with the previous post, these newer ones break easily on the handles and right between the lenses.  I had two cracks within weeks and now they broke.  Hope they fix these.

Few years ago post...
Awesome glasses.  These have the large bifocal area out of all the ones I have purchased.  These never leave my car."
True to size but super uncomfortable
I was dissappointed. Read the reviews. Ordered 7C for my toddler who wears size 7 in regular shoes. It was like a doll's shoe. It covered only 2/3 of her foot! At least I ordered with Prime and can send them back... So confused on what to order???.. :(
"Returned the dress. The dress is beautiful, but it runs small."
this is so uncomfortable and not long enough for me (from chest to hips) and it doesn't even work.
"I have had Sketchers shape-ups a few times and have come to love them for the quality, comfort, dryness, and softness inside all day wearing them and was looking for another pair after 4 years of my last shape-ups from Sketchers, which is still performing perfectly well. I needed a different color but looks like Sketchers do not make much of varieties anymore of Shape-ups.

My advice is, if you are a Sketchers user/fan, pls do not buy these replica shoes. These are nothing like real shape-ups. The comfort level and sole support provided in Sketchers is of premium quality and this is just a pair of shoes that made to look similar to that.  These cheap manufacturers must be penalized for using the same name as high-quality brands yet providing low-quality products. These shoes feel hard/rough inside like your feet is in wooden shoes.
Pretty colors though and that's about it. I read all the reviews before ordering these, and now I realized all those who are giving 5-stars are people who never put their feet in real, authentic pair of Sketchers' shape-ups. The difference is night and day. You need pretty sneakers which look like Shape-ups, these may be for you."
I usually never write reviews but everyone deserves to know: DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!! I absolutely hate it fits good but zipper was broken I bought to use as swimsuit not useful as swimwear and I've had to Re-sew the seams five times now
"These are very nice BUT; if you're a fat guy (2XL or 3XL) with a big butt, the inseam is WAAAY too long. It's a common problem and if it's no big deal go for it. Otherwise you'll have to somehow fold them up or sew them. Just way too long. The pull things on the bottom are useless to hold the legs up."
very flimsy and expect it will break easily....  too soft and bendable to last long
"They are very small so order at least a size up if you are planning on getting these. I did that, but even though they fit, they are not of good quality. They stretched out tremendously the longer they were worn."
the shoes were not comfortable at all.  the heal come off pretty easy.
These are very narrow from the top. Couldn't fit my sons chubby feet through it. had to return.
"This hat is weird looking! The visor is super long, longer than any other hat I have seen. Plus the front part doesn't fit tight to your head, it is big and square like a tuckers hat. Not cute. Returned."
"Arrived broken.  Very cheap quality.  If I had seen it in a store, I wouldn't have purchased it."
"Fit is ok but the legs lose their grip in only a couple hours,  and start riding up. After that the legs become loose and bunch."
"it looks good but don't buy this !!

because the Necklace was cutting off in 2 days only and no one try to cut it . It just cut it self this is cool"
Terrible customer service. Chain broke before I even clasped it.
"Judge by looking at the pictures, at exactly only one month of use and not on heavy work."
"This is a great watch except for one serious flaw.  It is difficult to see  the hands. The hands are nearly white on a white background. Why couldn't they be black?  They appear to be the slightly green  glow in the dark material, but that makes no sense, since this watch has Indiglo face plate. Black hands would be easier to see when you light the indiglo face plate and would be easier to see in daylight as well."
"They are ANKLE socks, NOT as pictured. Will be returning."
No way it could even fit 1 leg
Only had these for a couple of months and the canvas on the side is starting to rip and the rubber around the sides is coming loose from bottom sole. The quality is just not there like in the old days when they was made in the USA. I would not recommend these unless you want to waste your money! Very cheaply made! These should be sold at the dollar store for $5 or $10. Not happy with these at all!
I have worn New Balance in the past. These were not comfortable. Too sweaty and he sides of my feet hurt. I wore on my carpet for a few minutes and had to return.
"I am on the fence about returning these. They are very cute and I love the vintage patterns. However, there is no elasticity to them. The little give that they do have is from the fabric being cut on the bias. I was also surprised by how tight they are. I have a smaller head so usually things are big but never tight. Yes, it's necessary to be snug so that everything stays in place but not headache tight"
"I wore these shoes maybe 10 times and the string/laces already broke. I've gotten these shoes a number of times in the past and they've been ok, but I think this pair was defective. Really disappointed."
Sizing is way off. I normally wear XL but I order XXXXL. Still too small. I opened the lacing in the back to give me more room. But it loses the overall fit. Very disappointed.
the watch has a huge logo on the face that is not pictured it is also very large
"The boots where cute, but they didn't look brown at all! I thought I was sent the wrong color, but the brown color is more of a weird grayish brown."
I had to order 2 sizes and the larger one was too big and the smaller size was too small. They were too tight through the toes and the arch felt like it was in the wrong place. Also the quality of the materials used was disappointing. I thought it would be a soft flexible leather but the back was rough and very stiff. I would have had blisters the first day I wore them. I am in love with my olukai flip flops but these did not stand up to the standard those created.
I have always ordered Large on cloths from China. But this one is too small.
Got for my wife.  It is hot but size is incredibly small and my wife is small.  This size would probably fit a 10 year old girl it is so small!  Would not buy again unless size was bigger.
The inside of the cloth with soft nap will run out
Kind or wired shape not very flattering
"Love this shirt, but,  IT'S NOT COTTON!!  Sending it back, feels weird."
TO SMALL 5'4 180
"I've attempted to re-set this watch for my daughter. Ugh! I can usually find my way around any digital watch that has multiple modes (watch, chrono/stop watch, alarm, timer) and go into adjustment mode without any difficulty. But after spending 10 minutes attempting to re-set the time, I gave up and am searching online for directions...no luck so far, not even on Armitron's website (thumbs down for customer support--you should have ALL directions of ALL your products online ALL the time). Hey Armitron, it's a simple matter of converting your directions to .pdf format and uploading. Could it really be that hard? Thanks for making life for your customers just a bit more needlessly tedious. BOO!
While these .pdf directions are not for the exact model, you can 'translate' the directions and successfully though tediously re-set your watch including shutting off the freakin' alarm. It is a bit more complicated than, for example, working with a Timex Ironman watch, but it---eventually---can be done. See [...]"
"I took this to a clothes swap event with tags still on them so I was able to get better suited items in exchange. These run small and the arms are tight. If you are a medium, I would say order large. But I wouldn't recommend these because they're the stretchy, thin, polyester kind of top and not breathable at all. Too form fitting (like elastic) and not comfy feeling at all."
Shorter and smaller than I like Otherwise well made
"Was terribly disappointed when trying on the watch, and finding it too short of a band. If your of average frame, beware I think it was made for a child...wish I could get my money back!"
This was a gift
Love the style of the shoes but they were just incredibly BIG!
"Horrible product. I washed them before wearing and not only did they shrink and become misshapen, but one t shirt has holes already. Seems like a knockoff of the actual quality product."
"I took this watch snorkeling, so it wasn't even CLOSE to 100m water resistance, and as soon as it went into the water, I could tell that the watch had water inside. Never worked again. And this was at the one year mark, so  no warranty to cover the watch...  Will look for a waterPROOF watch next time"
I guess I should have paid attention to the dimensions.  It's really small.  Will have to buy something else to compensate for the things that don't fit into it.
"I fell in love with this dress by looking at the picture, unfortunately it is not what I expected, the fabric feels too cheap for the price paid, it does not fir nicely in the back is a little bit too big and make the front fall a little making me feel uncomfortable, I usually wear size 10 or 12 depending on the brand. I read a review that said that it came a little to big for the size 12 so I decided to go for a size 10 which wasn't so bad but is does not fit nice, and as well it was missing the belt shown on the picture. I will be returning this dress. Thanks to amazon for hassle free refunds and returns."
very uncomfortable for play basket ball
"This pair fit a bit too small.
I just wore around the house for a couple days and they were OK.
My first day out of the house.... I felt a little sore on the top of my foot just behind the big toe & it was more than just sore it hurt and was an open sore not huge, but enough..... I had worn them & I am hard on shoes I walk fast and pound the pavement ....
So I almost shipped them back, but I decided give them more time.... They aren't even just OK, I will replace soon."
"My size is 12/14 pants. I usually wear large.  I choose XL girdle. I have big butt and hips and those little pieces are always to small. Except Spanx, which I haven't found any that's tight enough for me.(they are expensive) This girdle was so small, I got it up, the legs were so tight they were squeezing my groins, the waist in the back set just at my lower back. I'm reading these reviews, its apparent that they are aware that the sizing is off. I won't try this one because I know the zipper will break."
runs large. cannot be worn
"While the bikini top fitted good, the bottom piece was a bit too large and just weird."
too large too too large too too too large
"I ordered an 11 B(M).  The boot comes in an 11 2A(N) also.  The B(M) was much too narrow.  I looked at the outside of the box and it only says size 11.  No indication of width. If this is a medium, I cannot imagine what a (N) would be like.  I spent over an hour reading the reviews and at least 30 of the 253 reviews felt the shoe ran too small.  I thought perhaps they were talking about length. I decided to take a chance because it was the exact color that I liked and Amazon has a terrific return policy. So now I am returning.  I am looking through all the snow/duck boots that are offered hoping to find one in a similar color.  She shoes were made in China and one thing that I have found out is that the Chinese version of size is very different from how the U.S. sizes clothing and shoes."
Too small. im donating them. The size 8 is definitely more like a 7 1/2.
"i bought the espresso bean boot, it turned out to be camel colour painted in dark brown. they missed some areas which shows the original colour of the shoes. i also found some traces of the paint on the wrapping paper.

very disappointed. I decided to keep as it will cost me a lot to return it back."
"My 9 month old is the size of a 12-18 month. This outfit ""fit"" him length wise but the way the outfit was pruportioned was so off the part that was supposed to be the pants hit way under his butt. Had to return."
"Very bad quality. When you wear it, you won't be able to see on the sides as its front part is very low. Also, the color is almost white unlike the picture"
Purchased these sandals in February 2017.  Love the comfort of the sandals.  Summer is just beginning here and I have not worn the sandals much.  Very unhappy that the blackstrap ripped on the heal.  I have not walked much in these sandals. Very disappointed in a $100.00 plus sandal that has broken with very little wear.  I will ask for a replacement pair or refund.
Mine arrived defective. I will be returning. It looks very pretty though. The hinge is tough to close and the latch will not latch!
run very large. no lining. see through.
"This design is cute on hand and a disaster on feet. Because, natural color/black dot leather pieces around wedge fail to align each other.
My 9W foot is okay for 9.5M shoe. Upper leather(might be synthetic) is too hard and cutting my foot, very very uncomfortable.
Return it."
it does not stay on. and it made my chest look as if i had a bigger breast than the other
I don't like the fit! the shoulders don't hang to the side like the picture
"I tried on numerous Clark's the day before ordering these and found the size that fits in all the pairs I tried on. All the ballet flats in the store were dressier than I desired. Found these and thought they would be perfect. Sadly, the back of the heel rises higher on my foot than those in the store and rubbed the back of my heel terribly within minutes. No more shoes to be purchased on line for me! Too risky. They also ran a tiny bit shorter than those in the store. They may be perfect for some one else."
"This review and scoring is more about the effects of cotton next to the skin than the Acorn Slipper Sock.

I love these and had some as a kid. That pair went somewhere without me, probably hanging out with lonely socks and pen caps.

I recently decided to buy another pair and chose the COTTON ones. Unfortunately for the same reason you don't wear cotton socks, underwear, and t-shirts while hiking. The cotton absorbs the moisture from your skin and environment  and creates a nice chilling effect(evaporation) around your tootsies. Not a good effect for slippers, imho.

Do not buy the cotton unless you will be wearing socks as well as the slippers. OR Buy the wool versions if you're going barefoot."
Ran smaller that sizing.
Gave to sister. Two sizes too small
cheaply made runs 2-3 sizes to small. color faded after one wash.
They cut into the top of my foot. Not comfortable. I sent them back..
Top looks beautiful but quality is bad.infact it was ripped a little bit.
Does not appear to be 47.9 mm wide. Confirm with seller before buying if this point matters . I was disappointed.
Way to big had to return
They were way too wide at the bottom - extra wide bell bottoms.
Leggings came ripped.
Very small . I am 5'6 115 lbs. I could barely pull this on !
They were too heavy for me as I have bad knees.
"They were so slippery on any floor other than carpet I almost fell!
Never buy them again!"
The soles turned hard and fell apart
Poorly nade
Total ripoff size is not right. I already have like 6 columbia shirts and they fit perfectly in 2xl. Ordered this one and size is not even close. Don't know if it's important but all my good columbia shirts say made in india and that one says made in vietnam
"Works ok but when the cable is put through the loops on a suitcase zipper & locked, it allows the zippers to be pulled 1-1.5 inches apart. So if you don't want a gap, choose a different type of lock."
Slim on the body as advertised and I wanted. Longer than expected but not a deal breaker as its easy to tuck in. My biggest issue is how wide the sleeves are. From shoulder to wrist it is very large for a slim fit shirt.  Looks and feels very out of place compared to rest of shirt.
Not even close to being a M/L.  The bottom cuts off my circulation and the top is tiny and poorly put together.
This shoe was one the worst quality shoes I have purchased. I ordered them about one week after wearing them the sole began to separate. I contacted Amazon in regards to replacing them. They promptly sent a second pair which fell apart about 2 weeks in. I will not buy another pair of skechers again.
"Adorable top, but 2 sizes too small. Luckily, it fits my daughter and she loves it."
"Very cute, but way too narrow! My daughter has regular feet, but could not get these even halfway on. Easy to return though!"
I returned these shoes. They were very! uncomfortable and cheap looking.
"Very disappointed, this is not nearly as cute as it looks in the pic, you would have to order it 3 sizes larger than you wear for it to look anything even remotely close to this picture of this girl.. It is basically a sweater - not a poncho!!! Mine came with a repair needed on the pocket, and I'm just not thrilled"
this is a waste of money
The size I ordered was x large. It looked like it would fit a child not an adult.it wasn't very pretty either.
Quality is good but does not fit to size
Cups on the top are HUGE and and the elastic around the legs looked like they were wire cutting through soft cheese.
"Usually Love Mud Pie - Very stiff material and ropy top doesn't stretch, so once my girl could fit into it I could not get it over her head."
"For the price, It was very nice but just way yoo heavy for me. It was made out of real leather."
Poor product and waste of money. The material doesn't allow much stretch or even scratch the surface when it comes to fitting comfortably. Big waste of money
Does not have support at all.  May be better if you are a smaller busted person.
"Too small for me, but not worth the hassle to return."
"These feel so heavy and clunky. I ended up returning them. They're also really loud on the floor and I have a baby, so it wasn't the right fit for me."
It was not I expected
"I am always trying to find open back shoes (due to Murphy's neuromas) that feet comfortable.  I have had good success with
Worishofer's #251.  Have four pair in different colors.  However, the black ones stated above are not comfortable.  It is the
same shoe, as far as I can tell,  but my toes hurt.  I think the problem is the leather.  My four pair have soft leather surrounding
the toes and the leather on the new black ones is quite stiff.  I am returning the pair I bought but hope to get another pair in
black with softer leather.  I think it is a well designed sandal.  I wear them all year long."
It turned color before I even got to wear it
"Well, we had much fun with my boyfriend because of these jeans. I should start with that i ordered it because of the positive reviews, however, i wasn't impressed by the picture that much. Also i ordered 2 pairs of CK jeans for my boyfriend. I wasn't home when the parcel came, so when i finally got back home, he was very happy and he told me: thank you for choosing these THREE pairs of jeans for me, they're perfect! That's how we found out we wear the same size. Of course i tried them on but they didn't look any good on me (the sizing is correct though), also look very cheap and baggy, not even close to skinny! However, they look really good on my bf, and actually the shape is similar to those men's jeans that we ordered."
The material is not that good. Cheap material. But design is cute.
really sheer and the fabric is flimsy
"I love Vibrams, have worn out 2 pairs. But not they seem to be making them for smaller and smaller feet! I have wide feet, but I usually have no issues because it's fabric and can stretch, but these are for some very narrow feet!"
i need to return it
"This was not what I expected and I've had quality issues with this top. Fabric is unusual, very fine weave polyester.  It's almost like that of a pair of women's tights and it behaves like it.  It's thin, slick (like silk), and runs/snags easily.  I've worn these only a few times and there are already multiple snags and runs in the fabric. I don't like the feeling of the silky fabric on the skin but this is subjective (I'm not partial to silk either).  They are light and seem fairly warm for the weight.  Mostly because of the easy-damage, I wouldn't buy these again at any price and they're not cheap."
"Rediculously cheap fabric, fit is bizarre. Maybe it'll make a decent pillow cover."
Loved this the first time I wore it. It shrunk considerably after the first wash. I did not use the dryer and it still shrunk. Quite dissapointed because I feel like it's now too short :(
It's a gorgeous show but was way too big for me
"Looks and fits well, but fell apart the second day. Threads pulled out and the front top started coming apart the second day I wore them, I wore them a third and forth time, just trying to get SOME wear out of them, and now have a 1"" tear in the top stitching...Chinese junk???"
"My last 2 pair of running shoes have been Asics GT-2170's, and they've been great, especially the cushioning. When I found out that Asics was no longer making them and was no longer advancing the line, I tried their GT-2000 series and was very disappointed. The cushioning is just not there, and they feel tighter -- even in the 4E wide size that I wear. I could definitely feel the difference just trying them on and walking them around the store.
  My old 2170's haven't worn out quite yet, but I'm no longer looking to Asics to replace them. Not with this offering! I'm going to try Brooks Adrenaline 13 and hope they'll make a worthwhile replacement."
Snagged right away.
This hat was hideous. It looked like an old lady church hat that sat on the shelf of one of those tacky beauty supply stores for a minimum of 12 years before being mailed to me. I am not sure how a hat can be equally brown and light blue at the same time but it was. Worst part is this thing was purchased for a costume party so it is not as if I intended to take myself very seriously in it. Not for the classy look.
I usually wear a medium and bought a large. It runs too small and I don't like the sleeves.
Sleeves are way to long for women!  Looks like a mans shirt.
I wear a 9 and these in a 9 were wayyy too small. They also had sticky stuff all over them and scuff marks right out of the box. The smell wasn't too bad. I had to return them though because they didn't fit at all.
The stones were pretty but smaller than stated.  Post is too long.  The earrings droop in my ear.  Returned for refund.  I ignored earlier reviews hoping problem with the long posts had been addressed.  I was wrong.
Ordered 2 sizes up and it still wouldn't even fit over my hips
"They run small. The seams are thick, and constantly rubbing up against your skin. Not very warm, barely any reinforcement on the bottom.

Additionally, since I've ordered these (A month ago) I've received 2 catalogs in the mail from this company. Totally unsolicited, unwelcome...and SENT TO MY WORK ADDRESS. Unacceptable! When I called the girl said ""Sorry, I don't control who sends those!"" What the heck does that mean?"
"I don't know how they made such a watch for kids, the quality and apparent shape is good, but the metallic parts are really dangerous, they peak out, my son has the habit to itch his nose while he is working or playing with the back of his hand, it injured his face and nose. Really unsafe"
Very disappointed!!!
Want to return but too much of a hassle for the price.  Went through process to return them since no return label was included and gave up.
Poorly made.  Lasted 2 days and broke.
I have owned and worn out 4 pairs of Kinvara 5's I get about 600Km (380 miles) out of a pair - love my Kinvara 5's had the 4s before that and a pair of the 3's - then i started using an orthotic in the 5's - no drama - these 6's however are horrible they are too small and very tight across the laces basically saucony took a great shoe a ruined it with this update - i just can not figure out what the testers were thinking - horrible horrible disappointing update - I'm buying all the 5s i can get my hands on
"its too tight , material is good though, shame i would have ordered a 36 waist.. :/
better check your size and theirs before buying .. you may need a bigger size"
terrible. Don't buy this. the only person who should be wearing this is Vin Diesel if he decides to do another triple x movie.
"Return this once I received it. Very thin material and a short scarf. It's just long enough to wrap twice, but ends up feeling tight around the neck."
"There wasn't an option for too large and too small at the same time. It's hard to explain. Fabric is thick, unflattering and uncomfortable. Not worth the money and effort to return and will remain in my closet as a constant reminder that when shopping online you get what you pay for."
"Wanted them to fit because I love the design.  No luck!  They were too long and too narrow,,  I don't think a size smaller would help."
Nice fabric but cheaply made - I could see all the seams.  The top across the breasts is too small and does not match the measurements on the item description.  The shoulders and arm holes were entirely too bi.  I am returning this item.
Strap was just a piece of felt and broke the first day.
These are great shoes once warn in and really comfortable to walk in. After a few months the shoe began cracking and just shows how cheap the material is. It is a shame since they are very comfortable shoes.
"09/30/15 Update - I bought these boots in 05/15. Please do not waste your money on these boots. Although they're very cute. The heel is very cheaply made. Feels like the heels of these boots are made out of recycled rubber tires, like what you would find in a children's playground. Total waste of money. I want a refund!!!

Pleased with the shoes with the exception that there are rough parts on the inside seam of the boots where the boot straps are attached that rub against my skin. I have to wear long socks so that the thread ending doesn't irritate my skin."
"Bought this skirt in a medium like I have all other maxi skirts.  I'm 5'9"" and typically wear about a size 4. This was well above my ankles and far more form fitting than I anticipated. I had to return it."
"This hat only gets a second star because I like the material. And frankly the Humanized Prevent Wind Rope is an awesome feature that I've never had the pleasure of owning before. I feel fancy.
Other than that, I'm not impressed one bit.
First off, it is NOT a unisex fit. It's a men's fit. It's too big for my head by far.
It came folded, which kinked up the wire and creased the brim, not even symmetrically. It took me half an hour of screwing around with the wire to get it anywhere near presentable. And the crown is still totally lopsided. It's creased so one side sticks up way higher than the other. Seriously who packs a wire stiffened cowboy hat folded up ?! You can't plan on folding it for travel. IT'S A WESTERN HAT. IT HAS TO BE KEPT IN SHAPE AT ALL TIMES! !!! Charge for shipping if you have to, but get this fact straight.
No wonder this company has to bribe people with free junk to get good reviews. One of the pics attached to another review giving good stars is laughable... Please don't go out in public til you fix your brim, the scalloped -edge cowboy hat has NEVER been a good look. What a mess.
I can't send it back, I have a cowgirl dinner to attend this weekend. Ugh.
Note to seller: it's cheaper in the long run to pay for proper packaging of a hat than it is to buy a bunch of reviews. Good luck."
Very disappointed in the width of this unisex sandal. I am a women with wide feet so often I buy men's shoes to get the width I need. I made the assumption that with these being unisex they would be a little wider than the normal women's shoe. No go. My foot is wide but not hugely so. But the strap is so tight and uncomfortable I am not able to slip my foot all the way forward so that the piece between the toes is in the correct place. The strap is also made out of a very stiff and harsh webbed material that does not help with the comfort. I DO like the shape and arch of the shoe. I really set my hope on these sandals. The only other men size options are amazingly ugly.
"While the socks are pretty they are extremely uncomfortable to wear unless you have legs like broomsticks.  They are extremely snug in their fit and so tight they are painful to wear for any length of time.  I have tried other HUE products and they are equally uncomfortable so it's not unique to these knee high socks.  The welt is so tight it cut into the back of my knee.  I bought both the black and the brown and can't wear either.  I called customer service and tried to tell the rep what the problem was but they were not interested in discussing it at all.  Consequently, will never buy another HUE product again."
"I was extremely disappointed with my bag. I called Amazon to learn how to return it. Unfortunately, it was purchased on someone else's card, and when the money is refunded, I could not guarantee the person would return the money to me. When the bag came, both sides were folded inward. I packed clothing articles inside in an effort to help it regain its shape; however, the creases from the cardboard backing was protruding through the skin of the bag.  (It is my deduction that they have use cardboard as the bag's supporting walls). Another issue has to do with the handles of the bag. The straps were incorrectly positioned, and the metals that hold the straps are crocked. Finally, the zipper is problematic, in that, it poses a lot of challenges both when I am attempting to open and close the bad. When performing either of these two functions, I have to manipulate the zipper and exercise much caution. I am concerned that even with this much care, both the handles and the zipper will soon be broken, as are the complaints with many of the negative reviews I have read. I purchased this bag primarily because of the voluminous amount of positive reviews. Recently, I have watched a Dateline program where they featured a number of individuals who explained that they are paid to go online and write copious amount of reviews for products and services they have never used. This is unfortunate as people like myself often read reviews and use them as aid when deciding whether or not to purchase an item. With so many positive reviews, I am led to conclude one of two things: either people are being paid to post positive reviews about this bag, or I was unlucky enough to be shipped the worst bag in the warehouse. I will never purchase anything from this company again. It is not worth the money, and were it possible for me to have seen it physically before purchase, I would not have looked at it twice. My advice, do not be carried away by the sea of positive review, give serious consideration to the negative ones as well. There might be more accuracy reflected in the negative one."
Material is cheap and not the same as pucture
Wanted these but to many bad reviews
This shoe is very inexpensively made shoe..so I returned it
These earrings tarnished so easily and turned gross colors and I couldn't stand to wear them anymore I threw them out
"Sandals look great but the material feels very cheap.  It's not very comfortable at all for the price.  Biggest worries are material quality, workmanship and durability."
Small in the cup area and not snug enough in the waist to be considered shape wear.  It wouldn't control muffin top.
The Product is cheap looking and runs very small. The Tuxedo do not look like the picture. AND IS MUCH LIGHTER than what's been shown. In my opinion i would recommend you save your money.
"O.k  ,but its a little big and it looks alot better in the picture then in person the fabric is not that great, looks cheap.the price should be lower i wouldn't recommend this item"
The material was cheap. The flops wouldn't stay down. The picture shown is not what I got. Someone who's an amateur tried to copy and make that dress except it didn't come out right.  I'm done buying clothes off amazon site.
"The green one has an underwire, even the large size did not fit my 34DD chest. The body part fit excellently, but I do not recommend this for larger chested women/women with long torsos. Ouch, I tried to make it work but it was seriously uncomfortable. 2 stars though for the color and material, I do think its great quality for the price, just not for big chests. I returned mine and won't even bother with the size upany larger in the body and itll look too baggy :("
"Super cute, good quality, but run super small."
Shirt popped a seam first day
"I found the pieces very beautiful,  was v excited to recieve them. How ever I was not familiar with Tibetan silver,  after I researched it I was very disappointed.  Tha levels of lead are so high that they day it is dangerous to health to wear it.  Information should of been given .information as to the differance of sterling silver and tabetan silver.  Very deceiving. I would like to hear what you have to say about the heath risks,  due to lead content .  I'm just checking for safety sake."
"First I paid extra to my jeans a little quicker and it STILL took a lifetime, so that xtra 15 dollars was a complete waste. Second they were to big but I guess that was my fault { I wear a size 11 and ordered 32, could have gotten 30 or 31}. Third, there are patches behind the distressing {holes} one wash and two wears later the patch on the WHOLE right leg has came off, I know there only iron on but still."
Returned. Product would have been fine except it was obvious they had been worn (deep foot imprints in slippers) and a clump of the wool lining was missing from the slipper.
"If these did not fit so large, they would be worth it.  Order a size smaller."
There are several small holes in the front of the pants. Very disappointed and a total waste of money!
"These are by far the worst quality shoes I've ever bought, which is a shame because they are cute, but as the saying goes, ""Don't judge a book by its cover.""

Two of the jewels fell off and were lost and then the strap broke the first week I wore them. The shoes were basically unwearable, so I contacted customer service and tried to obtain new jewels. They were taking forever to get back to me, so I just returned them. Awful. I used to love this brand, but it's gone really downhill."
"The magnetic closure seems like a good idea--right up until you realize that it doesn't actually hold them closed. These booties are supercute and seemed warm, but the number of times a thoughtful stranger handed one back to me because it fell off while I was carrying my little around made it impossible to put them on him anywhere but at home. In the end, they weren't worth it."
My husband bought this watch. The watch looks great and wears well. The problem he had was that it would lose about an hour of time each day. That ultimately defeats the purpose of wearing a watch if it can't keep time.
blah ugly not like the pictures
"I was so excited to receive these earrings only to be greatly disappointed. When I opened the bag, the plastic tortoise pieces were not even in the earring setting. After looking at the setting, the prongs looked fine. They weren't bent. So I don't know if they were just shipped that way. Very frustrating and disappointing."
"These are NOT Go Runs; they are something called Goca Run . They are a little on the narrow side, unlike most Go series shoes.
I'm going to give them a try since I bought them for the office. I would be returning them immediately if these were bought to be running or training shoes."
Wrong product. Won't return because it's close to what I needed anyway.
Cheap looking. Like something out of a Crackerjack box.
"Where do I start? Well they do not stay up, I'm constantly having to pull them up. Also they are extremely hot and make my feet sweat really bad. Not impressed in the least....
Definitely not what I was looking for..."
There is barely any padding to keep ears warm. They fit awkward and cold air easily got in with these. Needs to be thicker to actually keep ears warm. Does not do a good job.
NO Bottoms!!
Nice tie but came with ineradicable creases.
"I would have loved this shoe if it had actually been the size the box (and the bottom of the shoe) said it was.  I have an admittantly large foot for a woman (size 12) so I'm always excited to see something cute in my size.  When they arrived and I tried to get my foot in the shoe, it was a NO GO. The box says 12, the bottom of the shoe says 12.  I measured the shoe - the ruler says 10.  I sold them to a co-worker with a smaller foot.  She's thrilled."
Arrived a day later then expected and was missing a stone
"the shirts are too large and cheap, nothing like what you buy in the store.  I would not recommend buying undershirts online."
The sizing for this outfit is way off. I purchased 9-12 months fits more like 6-9 moths. Plus I washed it once on cold per the instructions and the colors ran. I would love to return this outfit don't buy it!
got these in my size and they were way to small
"Stiff, not soft. Hit in all the wrong places, even only walking around the bedroom for a moment. I am a Clarks Artisan die-hard but these went RIGHT back. No thank you."
"I have worn Teva sandals for years and years, was disappointed I couldn't find the same style as my old type when they finally fell apart, These are odd shoes - the straps are a good 1/2"" too short on one of the shoes - and the velcro pulls from the wrong side, these pull from right to left (on the left shoe, opposite on the other) whereas my other Tevas (I have 4 pair) all pull opposite. Had I thought about it at the time, I would have returned them, worst Tevas I've ever had."
The material is just what I wanted. The fit is not.
"I bought this for a photo shoot purpose only.  For right after my bikini competition. I could not wear it because even with it up like a thong, it didn't cover my areolas. Im 5'7, 130lbs and got a Large. Was super bummed and ended up throwing away."
"color bled on first washing despite following instructions
fabric feels cheap, poor quality even for the price point"
"I purchased the wallet mid Feb., it arrived with a few loose threads and after a week or two it got a little worse.  Not wanting to be stuck with a wallet that might unravel, I called and emailed Civilian and included pictures, its been a month with no response.  In the mean time, the belt clip has loosened to the point that when I sit down, the wallet slips off my belt.  I might have a dud and that happens, but this is not a company that stands behind their products."
5 Stars for the Price. 1 Star for quality. Very cheaply made but what did you expect in a watch that is cheaper than the battery inside.
its not a good quality and it fits smaller than what I expected cant fit.
Needed this for a Cinderella theatre production but these shoes are poor quality and were not even the same length or height overall.  They are labelled as the same size but really these are really bad.  Returned on day 2 and got my money back.
Too small really for all the water activities. The sizing on this product needs work.
"Thought it would be more of a knit sweater, but it's ok!"
"Very, Very small. So disappointed, thought I was done with my Christmas shopping now I have to shop for something else for my 19 yr old granddaughter. Quite acceptable for a 4 yr old. Very nice piece just a special gift for a small child."
The sides were totally different in the way they were sewn together.  I didn't notice until it was too late and ended up just throwing it in the trash.  It's sad because it would have been really cute if not defective.
no packing slip and no earing backings
"too small think it was sized incorrectly ordered a size 7 which is usually very loose fitting on finger, but this was like it was cutting off my circulation. not worth going through the trouble of sending it back will try to give to someone."
"Eh, If I wear a sports bra with this then it might fit... the item arrived much smaller than the size chart indicated. And the fabric looks cheap. But I guess you get what you pay for."
Too small and boring! Should at least be a little bit bigger!
REALLY UGLY in person
"NOT TRACK  PANTS MATERIAL , ITS MORE OF A  LITE COTTEN  WEAVE"
"I RETURNED THIS WATCH FOR 2 REASONS.  FIRST, IT WAS DIFFICULT TO READ 9NOT YOUR FAULT - JUST MY AGING EYES).  SECOND, THE BAND WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO OPEN."
I received it earlier then I thought it would come. The band fits prefect the cup size I think is alittle off I am a 38j in other bra and in this I have to get a cup smaller so I will return and get a smaller cup
Fits very narrow in the hips. I normally wear size large and have no problem but these are a little tight in upper thighs and hips. Not able to enjoy them. Wouldve been a good deal if they fit.
"Making the exact same shoes for a 5 year old and a toddler does not make sense to me because their feet have different proportions. I purchased this for my 15 month old son to wear during vacation. While I liked the material, the softness, the length and the width of the shoe, there is one thing that makes it unwearable. The Velcro bands are so short that they barely closed on my toddler's chubby feet. The bands overlapped and closed by about 1/4th of an inch and always opened up as he started running. I did not have time to buy something else so we just had to use it, but it was a pain. Most of the time I let my son go bare feet because of these shoes. It might work for older kids because as they get older, their feet get skinnier."
"Unfortunately, this was way too small and had zero stretch to it. It isn't a soft t-shirt, it is rigid. I don't even think a bigger size would help. Would probably be best for a teen or preteen who doesn't quite have the curves under the WW logo!"
"Beautiful on the foot ....but, upper strap ankle strap too large.  Doesn't secure the ankle.  Ankle leaves shoe with each step.  Slip and slide "
This shoe was at least a size too small.  Ordered size 11 and it fit like a 9.5.
do not waste your money
"I have a large head and long thick hair. Most hats are too small and uncomfortable. This one was indeed larger, but a joke as far as being able to keep it on. For me, it was not better than throwing a towel on top of my head and expecting it to stay. The stitching came undone after less than a day and the edge stretched out so much I had to use a safety pin to make it tight enough. Very disappointed."
Poorly Designed. Thumb is open and has no flap. Not particularly useful for warming your hands as a result. Worst pair of glittens I've ever owned
I tried wearing these shoes to a wedding and I ended up in so much pain that I took them off and went barefoot. The shoes cut right into my bunions.
"Too small, to expensive with postage."
"Fit is good and overall look is good.  Everything is in place for a really nice shoe.  But this is not the quality of shoe I would expect from Clarks. I've owned a couple of pairs of Clarks before and I found them to be really great, comfortable shoes.

Not this time.

I've had these for a couple of months now and they are OK.  I bought these needing a burgundy shoe for a wedding, and for that they fit the bill.  BUT glue stuff had to be cleaned off of the shoes in a couple of places inside and out.  The lining is awful.  The fake stitching around the outsole is ridiculous.  These are just so cheap looking to come from Clarks.  If I hadn't needed this color I would of sent them back.  It will probably be quite some time before I even consider buying Clarks after this one."
This is a HALOWEEN COSTUME...do not buy.  It does not look like this nor is it even close to the kind of material it displays in the photo.
"This top did not fit me very well. I purchased a small, which fit great in the shoulders and chest. However, the area around my stomach/waist fit uncomfortable for a work top. It was ""poochy"" in the front and made me look like I had a beer gut. Also, I like to be able to move around in my scrub tops at work. I think one thing that I would have liked is if it had the side slits at the bottom like some of the tops do. All of my current tops have that and I think I am just used to it. I am 5'2"" 140 lbs and ordered the small. Had I ordered a medium it might have fit better in the stomach, but would have been too big in the shoulders/chest."
"small, thin"
I'm a size 22.  Plus size is not even close.  It fit my size 10 daughter very snugly.
"a little too big, not very soft"
Thought I ordered brown.  I got black
I had to cancel my order
"i don't like these shoes, they fit ok, squeeze my right toes a bit and i think the right one is actually is a defect because it don't look the same as the other(plus it squeezes my toes) it has foam coming out of the tongue, and they were shipped out after being tight-ind super tight
overall not a very good seller and bad shoes"
"These shoes fit perfect and true. They ""look good"", but, upon further examination and analysis,the workmanship lacks quality finish and should not have past inspection. Back stiching on one shoe is quite crooked, and on both shoes it looks like they cut the top-edging/side-back leather too short and is NOT finished, but, open inside-outside leather gluing evident. The blue color is nicely muted. From distance look great, but, don't expect them to hold up well. This makes Stacy Adams shoes very suspect to me and doubtful I'd buy the brand again."
I had to bend the metal for it to even come close to fitting the ribbon made it impossible for the mask to stay on my face. It fell constantly and the male mask didn't fit and shed a lot of glitter.
Split horizontally across the back bottom from hip to seam upon first wear.
"I ordered the 7-1/2 M which was perfect in length however, the front strap goes across the toes too tightly and does not cover the instep at all;  for me, there was not enough front support.  Great shoe otherwise."
Item came frayed on left leg hole...junk don't waist your money
"I originally got this for my locker at the gym but....I actually never even received this product, I kind of forgot about it because of college finals but I mean that's still money basically stolen from me. Thanks master lock I'll just stick to the competitor :-)"
Inferior material.
after a year its like looking thru readers....the view becomes distorted
Walked around the house for about 20 minutes and my feet were hurting.  Not true to size.  Glad I did try them and they are a cute shoe.
Very displeased with this item. Purchased a size 48-50. Belt looks like a 24-25.
To say this is too small is an understatement! If you are a size 36 there is no way this will fit you...buyer beware.
"I bought this shoe was very disappointed when I got it ,the shoe I ordered was ten,but I couldn't fit it,it didn't look like the picture. When I opened the box it gave me a headache,these shoes smelled like pure rubber. My granddaughter wears a size eight women and it fit her perfectly. I will not reorder these shoes again, such a dissapointment for me!"
I don't like how this fits at all. The string tighten but leave the back saggy.
"I have bras similar to this style so I was not off-put by the over the head then do the clasps configuration. It's annoying, but it's not the worst thing in the world. I ordered a 38DD, which is my normal size, and it fits but its tight under my shoulder blades and it pushes out my back fat. So I don't know, maybe it doesn't fit. Either way, the Juno gets points for having adjustable straps (even if they are velcro) and for having two of the most comfortable and soft straps I've ever put on my shoulders. If the rest of the bra was as good we would be in business. Unfortunately, I didn't like how squished I was together (I don't have that problem in the other bras of this style), and the bottom of the bra rubbed weird on me. Normally I would just try another size but I don't feel like this bra fit is the one for me. It's a high end compression bra for sure, but not for this girl."
"The material is too thin. I loved the style, but you could completely see everything. I had to return the dress."
Not really that sticky
"This is a cute, soft and cuddly owl but it only stays on for 5 minutes.  No way to change it.  I don't like how it is only on for a few minutes. Disappointed in this item."
my regular size is 11.5 M shoes were too small. I returned them and got 12 M. shoes were still tight and uncomfortable. Perhaps I have unusual feet. I ordered Caterpillar work shoes in 11.5 M and am wearing them now
"This took weeks to get to me and would've been nice if the description specified it was child-size. I bought it for a Halloween costume, and even if it had come on time would not have worked. Cheaply made and too small for adult."
This product was NOT as advertised. It is definitely NOT the original Turtle Fur. In fact it did not even have a label at all which leads me to believe it is a knock off and a very poor one at that. It is very thin and the material is more of a thin slick polyester of some sort and has no fleecy loft to it at all. I have a real Turtle Fur hat to compare it to and believe me this item is not the original Turtle Fur. I probably should have known better since it was very inexpensive but I was thinking well maybe I'm just getting a good deal here but instead I was getting deceived and ripped off. About the only thing I can say for it as far as how it was advertised is that it is in fact a hat and it is black. Otherwise it's a real disappointment. Pay a few extra bucks and get the real deal from a reputable dealer. Don't buy this one.
This cardigan was too basic and the finish in the button was truly ugly. Did not return due to lack of time.
No back strap!
Horrible fitting. Top has no bust support at all and the bottoms are way to small.
Not what I expected but nice all the same.  It is definitely not for a 3x person. Does not fit the bust well and is rather short. Easy to wear.
My wife did not like the shoes.. The toe box was tooo short and caused her pain to try and get the shoe on.. She DOES have other Bob's shoes that work fine for her.... I think it is just the design of this particular shoe.
No shaping !
This has a decent fresh scent and a light suds but it is loaded with chemical ingredients and it dries out the skin.
"This is a nice skirt as far as design, but the material is very thin not what I was expecting for the price. I would recommend this skirt only if the price was lower. I would not purchase it again. I would like to add I ordered this again the same skirt and how dissapointing  it is NOT THE SAME. I want this is a jean material not the STRETCH MATERIALS, I would have order it stretch if that what I wanted. Not happy at all"
"There is nothing ""OVERSIZED"" or ""BAGGY"" about this sweater."
The suede in this shoes are poor quality
"Awful.  These were cheap and not red,  they were pink.  Then,  I had to pay $6 return shipping. Ridiculous."
makes my finger sweat and itch
Terrible it was like a shapless bag with shorts its wrinkly at the label and just a terrible shape i returned right away
sent them back!!
Ran too small and definitely didn't come close that fitting my slightly wider than normal calves.
Will return the shoes
didnt like it its very small than expetd in large size
These shoes were inexpensive with clear reason. The insoles are poorly constructed and caused blisters on the arches of my feet where there is a significant gap between the insole and the walls of the shoes.
Too small for large.
"I ordered the same size that I always wear in Merrells and they felt like they were narrow, not a regular size.  I returned them."
super cute but super uncomfortable
"Cheap, made in China."
It was a huge fit so I had to return it.  Very disappointing as I really liked the look of the product.
"These are a little unflattering and fit funny, but the same ones in the same size that I received with this pair are fine. Weird."
They ended up being the full boyshort instead of the checky style pictured.  It was not what I was looking for.
I don't believe these are actually Levis. Inseams are all twisted and talk about crotch crunch. ouch. I will never wear these or buy another pair of pants from Levi unless I can try them on first. horrible fit.
"This thing is terrible.  the material is rough and stiff. While there is extra material in the back, because of the stiffness it sticks straight out. I imagine this is what Marge Simpson would look like if she put on a hipster beanie.  Either the fake head they used is toddler size or they stretched the hat out first because around the rim, this fits pretty much like a regular beanie."
Flimsy and not very pretty to look at.
"It's cute, but it was wayyy to small! I'm a medium.. I suggest going a size or two bigger. The material was rough and tight."
I wish I could return it.  I will have to order a smaller one.  I guess that's how they get ya. LOL
This is an aesthetically pleasing product but the second hand and timer buttons do nothing. The 2 secondary devices are not for use. Does the website say this?
"The size description and the actual product do no match.  Normally I get a L or XL perfectly.  However, in this case, its too small for me."
So disappointed in this shoe. First of all the calf hair dye is running. The fabric where the spikes are is NOT SUEDE but fabric. Lastly it was UncomfortabLE to wear.
"Cute concept, but these tights were wayyyyy too big!  I'll keep them to see if she can fit them when she's 2."
"Super long. Large fell a few inches above my knees. I'm 5'10"". These shirts should be labeled as ""Tall Tees""."
I loved the style and tis was adorable but the quality was not good. I had frayed thread all over when I got it and had to clip them and then when I wore it out the zipper broke.
"I ordered my normal size and I couldn't get my foot into them.  I wear a 6.5.  They run quite small.  There also a little nick in each of the shows. Otherwise, they are a beautiful shoe."
Runs Extremely small. I ordered a 2xl and it fit like a small or even smaller. Sad it didn't work out for me because I was excited. So disappointed
The chain that keeps the ring attached to the bracelet broke within 10 minutes of putting it on. It's a very pretty bracelet but not worth it because it broke.
Too tight and low at the backside. Almost crack showing!! . Gave it a 2 star due to material. Extremely tight on my thighs! Maybe I gained weight! Will try XL next time.
"I read the reviews like always. But I ordered this dress in 3 different colors I wore this black on to a convention and the belt fell off and I didn't feel it or know it. The belt has plastic gold colored links and fabric like the dress on the ends that you connect to tie it together. Well the links are very cheap and they come apart causing you to lose your belt. 66.00 dollars is a lot to lose the belt. They should have made the belt all fabric would have been better and more practical, for the money. I like Danny & Nicole Dresses but 2 dresses I wore I will keep the 3 dress I will return not paying 66.00 dollars and lose my belt."
"Think I'll be returning this. The line from the liner shows through too much for my taste and in a weird spot. There's a prominent line about midway between my neck and top of my breasts that makes my chest look cut up in weird spots.

Update: They wanted to specially approve my return and I never got a response so now I'm stuck with this ugly thing. Guess I'll have to buy a giant necklace to cover up the seam. Thanks, bad seller."
"Ordered this for a pregnant friend that is going to deliver pre-term and didn't have any premie baby clothing. Imagine how embarrassed I was when she opened it and saw this onesie. Wasn't anyone paying attention for quality control? We don't have time to return it since this was unexpected. ""So oved"" really?!"
"These glasses looked awesome, but they were so flimsy.  Lasted 5 months and the screws fell out.  Would not buy again ."
Slips off with ever step.  I about lost them from store to parking lot. Very embarrassing.
"Cute for one day, then falls apart.  Not even worth $10.  Buying something more expensive is worth it"
"I'm bummed! I really was looking forward to seeing this top. Especially after reading all the reviews. Because I'm a 34f, but I have a very small waist and narrow hips, so was expecting a more form fitting top. I don't know if it was the blue marble color that I ordered, but it was very thin and see through and not form fitting at all! In fact it made me look like 2 ton Tessie lol. Because it just flowed straight down from my chest making me look preggo! In the reviews people said that it was a better quality and not thin? So maybe the difference is in the different colors? At any rate it wasn't and didn't look like anything described in the reviews. Not the blue marble anyway. I was looking for the form fitting shown on the model, but after receiving this yesterday and going back to look at the pic I noticed that the model is very small chested and therefore it is and would be more fitting. Also due to the fact that I had to order a large because of my chest when I normally wear a medium.  But thank you seller for getting this shipped to me sooner than the stated arrival date. Just wish it was what I had expected, according to all the reviews. :-("
These are pretty non outstanding as far as fluffy boot covers go. I ended up going for another pair of white sparkles I found on a different website. These were kind of limp dumb looking
For a Nine West !??!!??  I really question if this shoe is a NineWest....Very cheap looking...totally disappointed . Way way way disappointed.
too small for my over my eyeglasses sun glasses. I gave it to a friend for cell phone.
I've never had problems with size 12 shoes.  These were super small for 12s.  Just which they would have specified that they run a little smaller.
So awkward. Waistband was too tight. Looked awkward on me. Ended up returning. Color was even mildly garish. I felt like I was wearing an ill-fitting suit to bed. I didn't like buttoning up everything. Why couldn't it just slip over? Oh well. It was returned
"Deffinetly Cat has another planet size, even though it says US8,5, is like US 10"
Fits very clumsy
Slide off feet
vary open in back. unlike the pic on site.
"Small ear muffs would work better for child. Scarf is short, OK for working outside. Earmuffs are soft and nice."
Colors all wrong has to sell it..
"I ordered the large size but should've gotten the medium. Even while pregnant, this top fit loosely with all the gathers along the sides. Unfortunately I waited to long to make the return. The material is quite thick and heavy and makes me hot but does not breath well once I start to sweat, leaving me feeling cold. The cowl does not hang down as low as in the picture so it cannot be pulled down for breastfeeding as it might appear. Pills easily with regular wear and gentle cycle washing. Will not look nice for very long. Not impressed."
"These are crack creepers. I was unaware I was buying this variety of ""booty short"" item was returned."
"I was very excited about these shoes to use them at work. Usually Naturalize has very comfy shoes for women who work long hours. The leather and design is very pretty, but the area below the buckles gave me two huge and very painful scrapes. They are not comfortable at all. Couldn't wear them for more than 15 minutes,  so unfortunately had to return."
"This bag was way smaller than the dimensions listed on the website. My 13.3"" Macbook Air barely fit and I don't think I could hold much more other than a folder or too. The style of the bag was nice and it would have been great if it was bigger. Had to return it."
"I'm happy i did not pay more for these, there did not work.  I read the instructions tried to put them on a BIG failure.  The plus is they came on time that I loved."
"Incredibly poor quality for the price, Soles warped (construction defect?) and poor arch support.

Wide, duck-bill profile (not obvious from the pictures) unappealing."
Dunno what I was thinking. Dreadful. Drab.
"Unbelievably too sheer.  It is an unwearable garment. I would give negative 3 stars if I could. I waited too late after my purchase to pull this out to ""attempt"" to wear it. I saw that it was very very sheer when I opened it, but I thought perhaps I could make it work with a thin white tank dress underneath. It resulted in an awful looking combination.  I may have used it as a night gown, but I won't because the material doesn't breathe and will only make me hot all night.  I'm left scratching my head an wondering why any company would make something like this???"
"It's a nice enough cut, but the material is see through, so it needs a shirt worn underneath.  We needed it for a school production, and there wasn't enough time to exchange it before the performance."
...same as the other reviewer in that the chain broke away from the clasp while just trying to put it on!  Very poor quality.  A total waste of money in my case.
They didn't fit right and I had to send them back.
"These are tiny socks that look like a size small men or even small women.  I have an IMG jpg photo comparing them to the same brand in large that I purchased from KMart over the last 5 years, but it will not let me add photos even though there is a button for that.  KMart has closed in our area.  These must be made by Leprechauns - They sure did con me.  I would give them a minus 5 stars if that was possible.  Will I climb the 15 steps to the city Post Office to send them back?  Not!  They will now become puppy pulls/or rolled up balls."
"Beautiful, unfortunately way to heavy"
This one piece suit is cute but super small for a med I'm a size 0 n med is all they had so I took a chance but still it will fit my 4 year old niece!!
"not much of a luggage! its really small I thought it would be a substantial duffle bag for travel, mostly its the size of a large purse. Geesh."
I don't care for these flip flops they do not come close to comparing to my sanuks. If it is real yoga matt it is very poor quality. Stiffer and thinner than my sanuks. While wearing my feet feel like they are sticky and are sticking with loud trapped air while I walk with them on.  The size is a 9 on the small side but my foot doesn't hang over. They are ok for wearing a short amount of time. Cute and a pretty pink. The price was ok for the quality. You get what you pay for.
look like a  rag turned into a shirt :(
"i fell the first day..., they are too loose"
"The spacing between the two black plates are quite wide, not sure if my ears are naturally thin but there was space.  i would recommend buying the 6mm, these were a bit wide for imitation plugs"
Runs very small. Panty is not very flattering. It also shrunk slightly when washed. Wouldnt purchase again.
Too tight in the legs and too long. I will be giving them to a friend of mine.
"The heel strap was loose and I had to return them.  I really loved everything else about these, so it bummed me out.  They are beautiful shoes."
"I've barely had this 2 weeks, and the belt came off. I can cut it off and put it back together, but seriously, 2 weeks? And 1 of those weeks I was on vacation, not even using it. This is the 3rd belt I have bought from Mission, and each one has lasted shorter and shorter. I thought this was the ""last belt you ever have to buy"". I like the product, but I will not be buying another one after this one runs its course."
"Fit is perfect. Absolutely adore the colors BUT*** the backside has zero ruching and is so thin that when you put it on, the fabric turns a shade lighter and it's basically see thru. No thanks."
Crown doesn't screw al the way down. Looks good though and its cheap.
"dropped one on the floor, both balls split and broke. Ive had 3 break while in. But the price is cheap, and you do get what you pay for!"
it's too large for me~!
"Too small had to return it. Plus tne mesh was so thin, you could see through it."
"The tag said large, but,it was definitely a small size"
I am always size 30 in other Levis styles.. This one is so thight and small.. That I should order a size 34 if I have an idea of how small it is.. Cant return it because I am in Colombia.. If any help I am 5.7 and 165.
Look great but a large is a size 4 max
Fits like a potato sack
"shiny, flimsy, tacky. I a, not sure how I decided that these were the boots for me.  wouldn't bu it agai ."
Coat dirty and thin
"This wrap is so chintzy in length and width it's not worth it. The pockets are useless because the ends of the shawl only reach the elbow area. I'm a size 12, five feet six. Very cheaply made. I made it into a dog pillow."
"I was not expecting much but a few things to look out for:

-the black undergarment is VERY sheer and is awkwardly sewed to the dress. In the picture it shows the undergarment having a little dip in the neck-lining to go with the lace portion, but it is sewed on straight across all the way to the arm pits; it makes it look and feel cheap
- I am 5'4"" and found the dress way too short. I'm not ultra conservative, but if I drop something I should not have to worry about flashing everyone else the goods!
-I ordered one size up and it did not feel too tight."
"The rubber band is tight
 It seems not long use"
"These are super sexy! The quality is inline with my expectations (not super cheap but not exactly sturdy). The size is WAY off, though. I could not get them past my knees (usually wear size 8 or XL panty). Will try to return them. Only order these of you are small (maybe size 5 panty) and even then, size up!"
"I am a curvy girl with a large butt and hips and these did not fit me at all! They reminded me of ""junior"" style sizing. The denim is beautiful and the wash is perfection so I am sure they would look great on someone with a different body shape!"
The designs on the fabric make it look like teardown. The sizing chart is not accurate. I measured to get a size 16....but it looks loose and too long on me. I will return it ASAP.
"The fabric is polyester, not cotton, as described on the site. Cheap polyester. Very disappointed. It is going back.."
Way darker in color than expected 
I didn't know Titanium tarnished I wore the ring for three days and it tarnished and the color faded.  I bought another Titanium ring three years ago and have been wearing it everyday and it still looks brand new.  Good thing it wasn't to expensive
"Cheaply made - you will definitely not be working out in these. Extremely thin and flimsy leggings, and the lettering is coming off after one trip through the washer."
"Quality is good, colors are good, but for some reason 4M is not the same as in regular shoes since this size did not fit my 10 year old girl, either my 7 year old..."
Disappointed. We have several light sabers. My boys are big Star Wars fans. I should have read the description. This doesn't light up or make any sounds at all. There is a small barely noticeable part that lights up near the handle. It's a retractable saber and is also made very cheaply. My 4 year old is happy with it. But it's not very impressive as far as no lights. No sounds.
So so. More orange than expected. Let my daughter have it for dress up.
"Usually Keen runs small for me and I need to order size 9 instead of my usual 8 1/2, but this shoe is way too big. In addition, the strap is NOT adjustable. Cute print, but very disappointing fit. I have many pairs of Keens -- this shoe will not join them. Returned."
"Worst shirt I've purchased & was thrown away before wearing. It's a children's size shirt with a cheap, blurry printed of pic of GNR logo on it. The logo looked bad before washing, but it crumbled & peeled off in the wash."
Heel felt very wobbly. Returned them.
It's already broken after a few months of use
"Decent cap, don't like the strap placement though; its too high."
Ripped on 1st trip
LOVE LOVE LOVE these jeans only problem they wear out super fast. Like holes after a few wears. Very cheaply made but fit awesome.
"I feel like I'm wearing armor, there is too much padding and it has a strange odd odor that remains after being washed twice."
"I sent it back, the seam on one side of the hat was messed up.  I didn't order another one because it looked cheaply made."
"Line apparently not from this sweater stick around. Clearly it is a second hand. Smells like chemical. Fleece inside. Not as described. Thick, poor cotton shell. Terrible buy. Remorse"
Horrible. The small would maybe fit a 5 year old waist. Worst customer service ever
"I paid less than twenty dollars for this dress; The dress was too small so I had my daughter take it to the post
office to return it to Crazy Girls. I was charged 16.75(sixteen dollars & seventy-five cents )for return postage!
I will never order from them again! ( I called the post office to see if I could get a refund & have the package
returned to me since it was still in the post office; they said I could have the package back with no refund! So
much for that! You live & learn! I will pick up the package & sell the dress at a garage sale this summer.(as far
as the dress, you get what you pay for! The material is soft & thin &  everything clings to it .(Just want to add that
I love Amazon.com! I am doing this review just to let others know about unexpected costs on out side websites!)"
I bought these boots to be an every day sort of foot wear - something that I don't have to think about. But unfortunately they were not for me. I found that the foot bed was narrow. I have bought so many pairs of Sorels over the years and have never had a narrow foot bed until these boots. I thought I could just break them in but the narrow foot bed was never going to get wider. It was disappointing. I did like them but not for me. So if you need a wider foot bed steer clear of these boots. Sent them back.
not comfortable....cute though
"Not at flattering, not a soft fabric a little large. I have a butt, but not a large one. These were slightly big in my waist but left way too much room in the pelvic/hip area an baggy on my butt. It made me look like I had a front butt. Awful fit, poor material. They are being returned!"
In the ad pic looks big ! I received a shirt for a child! I'm petite 5'2 with 130 pounds this shit is small and I order the large one ! The matterial super cheap what can I expect ! For the price ! 
Rough material and colors faded after 6 washes. I don't recommend.
"Dress fits well,  but the picture of the dress looks way better than the actual dress...the colours and style are different..."
This is an adorable swimsuit that my daughter thought was beautiful. The only problem is that the size 4 swimsuit is actually smaller than her 3T swimsuits. The actual size of the size 4 suit was a large 2T. It's a shame because the suit is very cute.
"Fabric is soft, nice & thick.  But it's way too tight.  I ordered size 12-14 but it is tighter than my size 6-10 socks."
Ordered largest size offered and was still a lot too small when received
The leggings arrived ripped in both knees. A big rip above a cats ear on the left knee and tears in between the whiskers on both knees.
Going to take awhile  to break in. The back heel is super stiff and rubbed my ankles raw.
"I bought these at DSW, and though I noticed there wasn't a whole lot of arch support, I thought the cushioning felt pretty decent. But then after spending an entire day on my feet in them, I can't say I'm impressed. The shoe gaps quite a lot at the sides, and by the end of the day, I really felt it on the balls of my feet. I'd say for someone without any foot problems, they'll probably be fine. But as someone who has issues with plantar fasciitis, I can't see myself wearing these all day long on a regular basis or when I'm traveling/walking long distances. Shame because they are really, really cute."
"nice jewelry, too pricy"
Bad quality. The lights and the sound don't last a week
"I am appalled and shocked that this product is even being sold!!! The smell of gazoline is incredibly strong. I let it soak overnight, and re-washed it two more times. Still smells very strongly!!! This is a gift for my breastfeeding daughter but I don't know if I am going to send it to her. How can you even think one minute that a feeding baby would have this under its nose??? I will try to wash it again a few times and if the smell doesn't go away, I'll send it back to the seller. Too bad!"
This is $24 fabric and quality -waaaay OVERPRICED!
Way cheap design. Returned.
"Nice shoe, but soles too sticky for line dancing.  I like more slippery soles for sliding and turning"
"On arrival they measured only 28 inches in length. They are flat, but very narrow, and don't stretch very much. They are useless on the average size athletic shoe."
"The color is nice and they fit, but there is little to no traction, making them unsafe for running. They are even slick on concrete."
"I am always a true size 11, but these had my toe at the very edge. I bought the size 12 and those had the support messed up. I would not recommend this style. I got another pair or new balance sneakers I like much more."
"I returned these heels... very very narrow.  Color was pretty, but the fit didn't seem symmetrical."
Toe is too pointy.  There isn't much differentiation between right and left shoes. Painful.  My feet are not wide. Returned!
"Wore these one day to work and by the end of the day, they were stretched and misshapen. Totally blown out. And the dot well to begin with....just kind of, fell apart"
The big blue stone's color is nice but the metal and rhinestones look cheap
"I usually wear a size 10 and lately when ordering boots from Amazon I've noticed that I have to order half a size bigger because the boots don't stretch so I took the risk and ordered a size 10 1/2 which fit perfect , the only reason why I'm giving such a horrible rating is because when I opened the package the leather on the boots was already broken and they had fingernail scratches on them I did contact Customer service . I'm upset that they look broken into already why would they send them this way ! Other than that style and boot looks beyond cute ."
Too small and too short!
Hurt my feet when wet.
"I have worn this bra for many years, but the last 2 I bought fit poorly and are stiff and scratchy.  They have been washed several times , but there's no improvement."
I hate it - it's cheap and stinks really bad..
very stiff ...
Stem was bent
"Meh, it's okay for a costume. Thin and kind of cheap material, and velcros closed."
"This is my second bag from Dalix. First one was very cheap and ripped quickly but I decided to buy this one since the price is much higher (expected higher quality) and I needed a longer bag for a wedding.

The quality of this bag is ok ( better than the one they sell for 16 dollars on amazon) but it is not a proper travel bag. It is very flimsy and does not protect garments inside.  It is also very hard to carry it around since it doesnt have a shoulder strap and is long.

The main zipper is good but the ones used to zip its two pockets are of low quality and started breaking during the first trip.

I do not recommend this bag unless you really have to transport a long dress and have no other option."
They are cute.... but not worth the money .... more like 3 dollars I paid 12... wanted a better  quality  bootie
"I have owned other pairs of Merrell shoes in the past and these are not of the same quality I am used to.  I am a working photographer and wear these instead of dress shoes.  I can be on the move for 8-12 hours a day.  Even with orthotics in them, my feet hurt tremendously the next day.  The laces never quite feel right. If snug, they pinch my foot, if loose they come untied.

I have regulated these to extra curricular activities only.

I haven't give up on Merrell, but will no longer expect the same quality across their product line."
"These shoes ran small, and I returned them. I have problems with fitting my shoes because of my shape of my feet"
"I read in other peoples reviews of how small Southpole wear runs much smaller than advertized. But because it was on sale I thought what the heck, I'd give it a try.  When I received this and tried it on, it was WAY small. I ordered a 4XL and this Item is lucky to make a 1 or 2 XL.
My wife just inherited a new sweat shirt.

I would NOT recommend Southpole to anyone, but if you do try one order it 3 sizes larger than you normally would"
"Cute but too big & flimsy. Feels more like a $10 cheapie.
Definitely not like the other reef flip flops I own, that actually give outstanding arch support."
This is my worse purchase yet. This dress is super small and resembles the photo but the mark was missed slightly. Kinda like a knock of purse
Scuffed and ruined within a week of light wear :( they were so cute too!
"Weird fit!  Toes are right up at the front which is fine, but the back heal is too wide causing my foot to lift out of the back when walking. It's a crazy odd fit as I can't go smaller cuz toes will be cramped. Sending them back"
"I'm 5'4"", 130 lbs. I got the XS. I get these are supposed to be cozy, but this was way too big all over and not at all flattering. It was pretty warm though, so it does its job for that purpose."
"I liked the shirt, but I bought it for my 12yr old daughter. She never wore it."
"Terrible no idea how to tie this , sux"
"The shoe is fine, but I have bad ankles and something about them irritated my ankles. I'll have to send them back."
DON'T LIKE TO LARGE
"Shoes fit well and nice style, however these shoes DID NOT have cleat bottoms??!! Was disappointed because they were purchased for golf. The bottom was smooth like a sneaker. I ended up keeping them because my daughter liked them and we didn't want to go through the trouble of returning. Beware that you may not get the shoes a pictured."
"Too LONG!
All my pants are 36X32, but those are like 36X36,
Send back and ordered 36x30,
quality and design are good. almost european fashion...:)
Will update when comes."
"Returned, too large and not what I expected, would be nice for a larger person."
"The top fit just fine, but the fabric was more of a crepe and I expected a smooth rayon style.  it was scratchy"
"This bag was returned because it was larger than I wanted for one but mainly because the colors were a crazy mix.  I love red; coral; black and almond but the one I received had a lot of blue, including the closure flap.  It is such a gamble as to the color combinations you will get and the one I received would not compliment my wardrobe colors."
I bought two of these leggings two in red and one in black as a gift. They are pretty warm and thick unfortunately when I washed the red one bled in my other clothes and  they leave my nails red when I wear them!!!! My other complaint about these leggings is that is has high inseam front and back so it is not flattering with short tops! I don't recommend these leggings at all!
"The front part is too narrow, long n tight. I hv to remove the insole to fit my size. However it is pretty uncomfortable when I walk for about 10 mins. Though I hv ordered a size up my feet hurt every time I try to walk."
"It was very cheap looking, but of course it was very inexpensive.  I should have known better.  However, return was easy and efficient.  Don't waste your money on this."
"I ordered David Archy but; I think they sent me David Achy.

These run really small. The waist band is too tight and they are too 'confining' in other areas. There are better options out there for less money.

I was contacted by their customer ""service"" but; they offered no help other than to ask if I had read the Sizing Chart and to tell me to buy more of their underwear with a 'wide waistband'. Huh? Throw more good money after bad, under sized underpants?"
It's tarnishing already smh
Pretty to look at but VERY lightweight. Feels to like. But shipping was fast! :)
"returned, it was far too large, not the right color and oddly short"
Junky
"Nice, warm leggings but the large/extra large is more like a small except for the waist, meant for someone without curves. I wear a size 10-12.in pants and these are quite tight and not enough material in the seat."
NOT a slouchy hat at all!!!!!!! Super disappointed. :(  should have listened to the other reviews.
This outfit do not buy you can only wear it once the seems split and frayed in the front and the crouch and the side legs. the fit was a little loose but very nice until the thing started coming a part I tried to fix it but the material once fixed just frayed more and more. waste of money done get it.
"Garbage quality. Lower than Old Navy quality. Cheap, see-through fabric, bunched/puckered in the shoulders, large in the waist. Not worth the price point, even a little."
"Thought would have white lace but it has gold lace, not what I expected"
get what you paid for. this necklace barely made it out of the package before it broke.
"It is very comfortable, but it is very weak, after warning it many times it cut from the down."
"More of a flimsy scarf than a shawl. I returned, not true to color and not worth the price.  Just incredibly cheap, I think you could definitely find something better."
"I'm apple shaped, so as usual they are too tight on the waist and 2 sizes too big in the butt and thighs.  I hate it!  I find jeans to fit me so rarely, it's ridiculous!  Sucks."
"I've bought several pairs of Sanuk flip flops and loved most of them, but these are the one pair that's consistently uncomfortably. I thought at first I just needed to wear them in, but many wears later they still give me blisters."
The legs are snug (my legs are athletic) but the gut area (mine is pudgy) is large and the crotch sags.
"This is nice. I like the material. However, the sizing is off. I order size 32 like any other pants I have. This one is larger than expected. One size smaller would be perfect. Another thing I like us the deep pocket. Here is the biggest drawback. After first wash, some threads just coming off everywhere. I sewn back at some places.  Should I buy another one?  Maybe if I am guaranteed good quality handiwork. Another problem is; it is labeled as slim fit. Truth is, it is slim straight."
"I wear a size 10 & that's what I ordered. A ""10"" was printed on the inside of the shoe. When I tried them on, I couldn't get my foot to fit all the way. I compared them to my other shoes and they were a couple of inches smaller. So actually they were a size 8. Instead of returning them I gave them to my sister who wears a size 8. They fit her just fine."
"Great quality bag.  Price was fair as well.  It's pretty limp but is very functional.

12/2016.  Had to revise my review because only after a year of use the lining in the two large end compartments has completely ripped out.  The exterior of the bag is intact.  I use this as my gym back so it's not over-packed.  Great exterior, flimsy interior.  I need to replace after a year of moderate use, never heavy use."
These were great til the zipper broke while at work...first time I wore them
Bought these for an overseas gift.  Text printed on them say MADE IN CHINA.  I bought pinking shears to trim the edges off so that my colleagues would not be offended.
"too small. I usually wear 8, bought this in large and couldn't close it"
To large and a hassle to send back. Would not buy again.
"band rides up. fabric very thin..guess you get what  you pay for.
Not very comfortable at all.  Maybe better for smaller sized
juniors."
"I got the flat shoes at my door at 5pm and went to the mall for couple hours. When I came back home the sole was demaged like I wear for a couple months and walked on the rocks.
Its not confortable also.
Did not worth $40!!!"
I loved the watch but a week after it arrived the battery died having a hard time trying to replace the battery. That's the only downside the watch is beautiful
"I have been searching everywhere for a comfortable strapless that stays in place. This bra received generally very good reviews so I thought I would give it a try. Based on what other reviewers said, I bought my typical size and expected it to work. The bra did not stay in place and the cup size was too small. I found almost the exact same bra, same size, by Maidenform, at Target and then cup came up a half in higher on top. The Target bra covered what needed to be covered and stayed in place better. Because it wasn't sliding down, it was definitely more comfortable. The Target bra is also a convertible bra which makes it that much more versatile. I'll be returning my black strapless Lilyette bra and replacing it with one from Target."
It's very nice one but arrived broken. the left Ear was seperated
Smells really bad. Made out of cardboard and does not breath. Feet sweat instantly and my feet never sweat. Uncomfortable. Looks good but wish it was better made. Returning product.
Not one year old and the strap broke. Yeah! the soles are great but I wish I could return them as not lasting 1 ONE YEAR.
"The leg opening was 2"" smaller than the previous styles sold. The waist was also smaller. I had to return them."
My middle toe (the second one) is my longest toe and it's totally scrunched in the shoe.  I also got a bad blister on the ring finger toe of my left foot when I wore them on the first day of school.  I'm hoping if I keep wearing them the fabric will stretch and mold to my foot because they're super cute and would be comfy if they didn't crunch the heck out of my toes. :(
cheap material and small. I couldn't even wear it
left shoes is smaller than right shoes..
this will only fit an 8 year old
"good shipping, but way too small. would fit a kid not an adult"
Does not fit like the pic at all. Cheap fabric. Item looks and fits like a beginner sewer made it
not a good quality made shoe
"I like the watch itself.  Having said that, I have a small wrist and had to wear this on the tightest hole on the band.  When I tucked the remaining band into the loops, it didn't stay tucked in and kept flopping out/around.  Very annoying.  Some people that order this might not have this problem, but the metal band loops slide along the band--they aren't fixed--so the band sliding out & flopping could happen to others as well. Other than that the watch is nice, but it was too annoying to wear with the band always flopping out/around."
"Not very happy with product. The nylon is somewhat stiff. And the elastic in the waist wants to roll under. The fit is a little tight and I wear a size 6, don't think it would be comfortable on a larger size. In my opinion it's cheaply made. I will keep the petticoat as I need it for an event in a few days and I will only be wearing it once."
Awful! It feels like I'm walking on cardboard...or maybe just straight concrete. The sole is hard as a rock. The boots have NO traction I feel like I'm sliding on hard wood floor I'm almost to nervous to even attempt wearing them during winter. I don't normally bother giving reviews but in this case I'm so disappointed with these boots especially after seeing the ratings I thought for sure they'd at least be decent! They're garbage don't waste your money!
"Pretty, but cheap material gave my chest s huge rash that lasted for a few days. I wore it for about 8 hours at a wedding and the neck morning when I woke up my chest was covered in red, itchy bumps :("
"Dial fell apart just over 30 days and had to fight with Amazon to get a refund/return.  Apparently its NOT covered by the 2yr Amazon watch warranty and they will try and pawn you off on the manufacturer who is likely to not honor any warranty because the seller selling through Amazon probably is not an authorized reseller.  Of course the company that sold it through Amazon was useless and referred it to Amazon.

I do like the watch but they seem to have quality issues now.  I have seen other reports, here and elsewhere, of issues like improper assembly, hands falling off, broken dials etc.  Very much suspect this ""swiss made"" watch is just more Chinese made junk."
don't buy it
"I wore them once and they stretched out at the  finger part so badly.  I won't wear them again.
I have a different brand that has held up for a few years that I will keep. The also rolled up at the edges.
Not a good look."
"It wasn't robe or dress at all, more like a short t-shirt. My wife is 168cm, but this product was right above her hip. We got it in small size. And material is really flimsy and see through. Cheaply made product. And sizing is very off"
Wife never wore.
"The receiver of the gift was dissatisfied with the way the clasp works.  BUT because I was thoughtful and bought the watch too far in advance, the return posily terminated and I am stuck with an unuseable produce.

It takes two hands to close the clasp; one of which is supplied by a second person

II will continue to buy from Amazon, but I will not buy gifts here."
Runs smaller than expected. Had to return.
Extremely toooooo small. Have to order 2-3 sizes up
"Great container but of the 2 ordered, a closure tab was broken on one container. The container cannot close securely without both tabs. Now have the hassle of repackaging and returning the broken container.
Although I like the container, I will buy them locally to ensure I am not getting broken products and have the hassle of returns."
"Too small, I should have noticed country they were made.  China size is different.  However, when I tried to put one on, gently
it tore.  So, I threw them out.  You may like them but I didn't... totally."
I got a 24k gold plated butt plug instead
runs small!!
"I saw this ring and had to have it..but when it came, WoW did it look fake...it also felt fake. I know it was beautiful, but there was no way that people could believe that it was remotely real...Right setting, wrong materials...Sorry, I returned it..."
"So I should have listened to the reviews on this before purchasing it.  I am 5'8"" 148lbs, have a fit physique, and wear a 34 D on top.  I ordered a medium thinking that it would be perfect.  The bottoms are made for a 12 year old with no butt at all!  I put the top on it fit good but half my butt crack hung out and if I pulled the bottoms so it didn't my front hung out.....I would by no means recommend this to anybody unless they were to offer mix and match."
"Bad quality. I understand that China made, but didn't expect to be so low on quality. Do not buy."
"These earrings are very delicate and the tanzanite is beautiful.  I was disappointed by the size of the
 of the gems."
I wanted some slip on shoes to take a break from my heels at the end of the day. The first time I wore them was during a lunch break and I walked to the store. That was a big mistake and I think it would have better to be in heels. There is absolutely no support. The sole is basically a thin piece of plastic. They will probably work within an office environment and for short periods.
The waist rolls all day. Others I precious had in same brand have not done this.
"I liked the color but it's not worth $25 more like $15. Material is very thin,  more of a light jacket than a blazer.
It also runs small, if you're a medium buy a large, if you're large buy an extra large."
"I bought these for my husband and he complained that he couldn't see with them on. I don't know, I guess just don't drive with them on! They look cool."
After washing these socks  were too small! You cannot even stretch them out to normal size.
"Not impressed  Way too small and the material was staticky, water resistant and sheds, which is not really what you want in a bath robe."
received the watch installed new battery the watch would not keep time would jump ahead 5 minutes every hour contacted seller they demanded I remove rating first before they would negotiate new watch which I wanted or a refund not removing the posting this watch is no good in my opinion I know its only a 6 dollar watch but it was a work watch for me kind of a throw away anyway but I at least expected to get a good six months to a year out of it...
Tooooooo small. Toddler sized
Pulled my breast apart and down. Not the fit I was looking for. I love the hook in the back to make a racer back bra. Wish is had fit better. Otherwise very comfortable.
very disappointed was hoping for it to be better than it was. wasn't for me
These were way too small for me. I'm a size 10 narrow and they scrunched my toes and was painful. They should come in sizes.
the zipper was very cheap the zipper can not zip properly even for an adult let alone a child
Made in china
Poor quality of the product. One of the shoes just use twice suffered damage to the heels. It seems as if he had lost the consistency is not hard and tough as the other. How could he claim warranty?.
My husband could hardly pull them up much less get them buttoned. Do not seem to be true size 42. Length would be great. Material does not give at all.
If you a Large you should probably order XXL. In other words the shirt itself sucks way too small plus the material isn't that good at all.
Colour fades in a month
"My almost 6 year old wears a size 6 in most brands. However, this tank is fitting but strangely huge in the arm hole. I will try another brand. On top of that I wrote earlier that the packet was supposed to be red, blue, grey and black but what arrived was only grey and black."
"The chain is not sturdy enough, and when carrying the purse the chains and pearls fell off. I should have checked out the reviews before buying."
"I am a size medium, and this was too large.  I look like I'm wearing a gunny sack for a top.  I will only use this in the garden or around the house, wouldn't want anyone to actually SEE me in this top!  The arms are very large and my arms swim in it."
Unable to even try it on. This is either mislabeled or multiple sizes too small. Did not stretch.
"Stain on bra and no option to choose underwear size, instead got sent a size 3 times too big...

I tried washing the bra hoping the stain could be washed out, sadly not the outcome.

I would have really enjoyed this bra and underwear set if I got unstained bra and the right size panty. Couldn't use both of the items for the intended purpose. Had to go blow more money on a set similar. Very disappointed."
Ordered the size I normally wear and were to large couldn't keep them on
"These shoes are cute but they are awful for comfort.  They have absolutely no arch support and really no type of support at all.  I got them
Because of the good reviews.  I've been looking for something to use for aerobics and these were not the right choice! Im between a 6.5 and 7.  I got a 7 and they are too big"
These arrived completely messed up. On one the pearl is half coved in dried glue. The other the pearl is glued only halfway down the post so there is a gap between the pearl and the butterfly. Cheap crapbut paid <$1 so in the trash they went.
"Velcro straps wore out after several months and fail to stay attached but flop around. I wonder if these were cheap ""knockoffs"" and not real ECCOs."
"I've been on a shoe hunt for slippers for the past 3 months and I've become very frustrated. I've order from many brands, primarily through Amazon, and this is my honest detailed review.

Overall: These slippers does not seem like the Dearfoam brand. They are more on the cheaper side, a downgrade in material quality, and poor overall construction.

Foot/Arch Support
There is NO foot or arch support and you will feel like you're walking on a flat surface.

Inside Cushion/Softness
Thin cushion inside with faux sheepskin/blanket-like material. These do not even feel comfortable inside, I feel like it's missing more cushion (maybe wear some socks if you buy these) and thicker material for arch support.

Outside Material/ Design / Color
Not the most attractive slipper. These seem like a slipper NOT made by the older Dearfoam brand that had better styles and material. The color is as pictured.

Bottom Grip
The bottom have that cheaper plasticy rubber that although is rubber but STILL NOTdurable enough to stay put on your foot on slipper/wet floors. It seems like the bottom was made to appear like a ""cute"" rubber oppose to a fully functional (maybe less appealing) rubber. Definitely not an outdoor slipper.

Sizing/Width
The size seems true to size although it seemed a big wider at the toe area (true to the clog description).

Longterm Prediction
All I've ordered in the past, as my favorite slippers, were Dearfoam. I actually raved about how nice Dearfoam was in the past! However, these are not the same quality of those older slippers. In the past I could get at least 8 months+ (up to 1.5 year) on any of the slippers from Dearform. And just last year I ordered two pairs of slippers than lasted me 2 months before they started ripping and the bottoms separating from the slipper. With all my slippers I wear them EVERY single day and nothing has changed with Dearfoam expect the quality. I will not count on these slippers lasting more than 2-3 months.

Final Verdict
I RETURNED THEM. Based off of my previous experience with Dearfoam these are not the same 5-star quality they once was. I've tired and reviewed Dearfoams, Dr. Scholl's, Isotoner, Sketchers, Vionic and more on Amazon and still had no luck. I will keep trying and keep you posted... please follow my page for updates and more reviews. I hope this helped :)"
"Pros: Comfort! ,

Cons: Pricey for what you get, I wore my first pair out in only 1 month, then they had a holes in both heels,

They're very nice when new, but for the money they wear out super fast, they only have a soft foam pad that for this 160lb man gets flattened in a month and the soft sole wears out. I kinda think they are really worth about $14 to be fair."
"Spirit gum doesn't stick. My moustache almost fell off for every performance I had, and it wasn't even on for twenty minutes."
I received a skirt .. a cute Lacey skirt ...but nothing like what is pictured
Too much stretch out. They squeak when walking
These were for my husband. He said they were small!!
Leggings are too slippery. They don't stay on waist.
I gave this boot a 2 star rating because the inner lining is not sewn or stuck properly. It started peeling off after the 1st use and the boot started cracking after a few uses. Its a heavy boot but cheaply made.
The buckle at the back tends to hurt when pull too tight.
I loved how thin and beautiful it is but it is way bigger than I expected. I usually wear a medium but this medium is huge. Make sure to order a size smaller than usual on this product. I am 53 115 lbs and slender built.
Goodwill donation
"Very uncomfortable, like walking on cardboard."
These run very small & ride up.
These did not stay on at all. We are returning them.
"A or smaller that expected, but nice"
"I liked the style and they look so great! But the material with which they are made, feel kind of cheap and weak. Worst at all, one the boots had a detail, like a cut in one of its sides. I returnered them."
"The fabric of the flower looks very cheap.  I bought this for my one year old niece but  the flower is so big, it couldn't fit her head, so I gave it to my older niece instead."
"Material so cheap,"
"fits great, but the sequins are inchy and irritating, ive never actually worn the dress out because under my arms would be all scratched and red from the sequins before i even left the house."
"I ordered these for my daughter for her costume while we were on vacation. Fit pretty good, they were a little tight but ok. The problem, they ripped after about 30 minutes of wearing them!!! We weren't doing anything crazy either, just walking around Disney World during the Halloween Party. Luckily the rip was in the crotch area and no one was able to see but unfortunately they can not be fixed and are basically a disposable item. Please be wary if you expect to use them more than once."
"I would have loved to give this a great review. The fabric is of Dickies quality however after wearing this for less than 30 minutes one of the ornamental buttons fell off. I was not even cooking in this yet, I was just trying it on for comfort at the house. After the first was the inside button at the top came off. I can sew so putting the buttons back on was not a problem but this is much lower quality than I expected with a product that wears a Dickies tag. Overall it fit as expected and is very comfortable. I was just not expecting to have to retrieve a sewing kit 30 minutes after opening the box"
"These sandals are a perfect fit and I wear them all the time- even walking and standing for long periods of time. The price is also outstanding -I have seen these in shoe stores for at least $ 20 more. Make sure when doing a search for these sandals to search "" Merrell Women's Sandals Sale. If you do not put in the word sale, you will not find the lower price.  They are so comfortable that I am thinking of ordering another pair.
Well later after purchase, the love for these sandals is gone. Like some others before me, I found the buckle difficult to open AND worse yet, the strap near the buckle broke. I was out on a long walk when this happen and had to go to a bike store and get a plastic tie to secure so I could go home. A few weeks later the same thing happened to the other side. I am a petite person, so I would not expect a lot of stress to the sandal. The way the strap and buckle are sewn is really a huge weak point of design. I have since moved on to an Ecco sandal and am much happier and more comfortable. Though these sandals look nice, they will not last due to cheap materials and poor design."
"I loved the look and price of this, but sadly it broke as I had just put it on. The chain is very fragile."
"The glued outer parts came apart.
Footbed broke down rather quickly. I only used the shoes for lifting, so it was a little disappointing that they broke down.

They aren't bad, just not great."
The connection of the strap on this line of crocs is not very secure.  At first the strap would pop off and we would have to pop it back in.  After about a month it wouldn't stay on anymore.  The shoe looks and feels good but is worthless without the strap.
They were half a size too small from a regular size 2
NO WAY is this a size 18!  I am a true size 16 and I typically wear a L to XL in tops depending on the make.  This swim suit will fit you if you wear a size 12.
soft material but no built-in bra... personal preference issue
"These are teeny.  Like newborn teeny.  There should be room in the toes (per a pediatric podiatric specialist) if your kids socks are snug or the toes are squished together, they are too small.  Into the give away pile :("
"Only made it two months, the bottom wore out very quickly"
Didn't like the color ended up giving them to my sister
Have several pairs of style from Clarks. These gave me a blister unlike anything I have had! Not happy... waste if noney.
Didnt like this dress. too small didn't fit
"I was hopeful when I ordered the Verdi WP. The shoe ran true to size but was quite narrow. The Verdi WP didn't have the usual Keen roomy toe box & would only accommodate an average thickness sock. If you need good arch support, this shoe is lacking. It did seem to have good cushioning and no heel slipage. I really wanted these shoes to fit but had to send them back."
"I normally wear a size 14, however, it was too tight.  I went up a size to 16, and it fit except for the waistband.  I wish dockers would size the pants appropriately, all over."
"They show that the metal is silver, but it's not, it's gold.  I bought it for a gift and she accepted it, but she was very disappointed."
"I'm 5'1 and have fairly normal sized hands and it's way too big. The chains are annoying, and everything is super cheap. It is only $3 after all. The ring is so cheap it's worse than the rings you get out of a gum ball machine. Will probably replace the ring somehow. The jewel centerpiece was lose and peeled off way too easily so I had to super glue it back on again. The cheap bronze plastic part is too heavy for the lace so it bends funny when you wear it."
The shape is odd in that instead of a more boxy style its semi fitted and tight in the middle. I guess it assumes larger top and hip measurements. Not happy with it and cant wear it. I washed  it already or I would.............Expensive donation.
"I LOVED these at first! Perfect size, super comfortable and soft. After wearing only twice, the seams are coming apart on the butt. Very disappointed."
"I live on the ""Wet coast"" so having a rain jacket is a necessity especially if you don't like using an umbrella. (it is windy here, too) This jacket would have been a good choice except for all the stiff and tough velcro closing on the front and on the sleeves at the cuff. This is not pleasant to deal with and at the price of this jacket they could have provided snaps instead. Velcro is a cheap and ugly option for closing clothing. I sent it back."
really unflattering. Lots of material at the hips making it very bulky.
"Bought this shawl in Aqua. The color is of show-stopping beauty...but I had to return because it was defective.  There were small holes and portions where fabric was nearly transparent.

I liked the weight, the feel, the length, the everything. If not for the defects I'd have given this 5 stars easily. Want to reorder, but won't. Few months ago I bought this same Sakkas wrap in a beautiful vibrant red.  Didn't realize IT had holes until I was sitting in class, already wearing it. Sorry, Sakkas, I just can't take the chance I'll receive a third hole-ly wrap.  Pity. I don't know where, or if, I'll ever again find this type of wrap in this breathtaking shade of Aqua.

Sakkas, please get it together. When you send defective merchandise you make no money and I have no wrap. Nobody wins."
Boots look good and are quite comfortable.....BUT they squeak when I walk and I can't figure out why.  It's really annoying to the point that I don't want to wear them.  Very disappointing!
"don,t fit right. on waist.  it is cut to low for me.so."
Bag broke after one week of use. Straps no good.
"I gave these one star because they have great color. the inside sole is about 3/4"" too short. this is a very uncomfortable feeling when your toes are hanging over the foam insert. therefore, they will not be worn."
Have never had more trouble getting a bra on and off.  $40 wasted. Will be steering far clear of this brand.
If your plus size please DO not order. I wear a 16 and got the biggest size and its so small. Waste of money.
"Clarks quality control is slipping.  I used to love Clarks shoes.  Never had to read reviews, never had to break them in.  I purchased a lovely looking pair of sandals two summers ago and when I tried to have new heels put on, the cobbler told me there was nothing to adhere new heels onto as the soles were hollow rubber and they were not cheap either.  I just purchased two pair of Clarks mules in the last two weeks and had to send them both back.  Upon reading the reviews, seems lots of other women are having the same problems with these shoes.  I will only buy them from now on in a store where I can try them on.  These shoes were not only too narrow and short, but the right foot was the worst one.  They would be great for causing a bad fall."
Not level out of box
"Feels very flimsy and ""plastic-y"". The whole unit feels like I can break them without trying. The lenses are okay and for a cheap pair of driving glasses I guess they are okay. But for the cost I feel like I could have gotten a better pair of glasses at the mall or something."
"Got this as a Christmas gift, seeing as I'm a huge fan. The overall shield was sturdy and solid, but the paint job is seriously lacking. Either one color shows through the other or one is painted over top the other very sloppily or what look to be like paint drips. It's true that from a distance you can't tell, but I was hoping for quality that I would be proud to show off up close. My shield also did not get the arm straps in which to hold it; there is no way to use it, just to display it. I'm greatly disappointed and will look in to returning it."
"Made very cheaply. Feels like something purchased at the dollar store. I do not recommend. Also, runs wide."
worn for the first time it's cut
"I wear size 12 pants. I sized up to size 14 and these are way too small in the waist. If I sized up so that the waist fit, theyd look like diaper pants."
"The cup and band size were as expected, but there was too much material under the arms and on the upper chest to make this comfortable for me."
Didn't fit as I expected. I returned. Made for someone smaller breasted.
"This bag looked good and worked well for the first week and a half, but after that I had to get one of the straps reattached!!!  That was ridiculous!!!  I would not recommend this bag!!!!!"
Not a big fan of this set.  I also bought del Ross's cotton flannel pajama set at the same time and have washed them three times and this pair looks 10 years old.  The piping is frayed and the colors look faded. I have a different set from this company that is 4 years old that look great so it must just be this pair.
"Nice looking belt.  Color matches my shoes.  However, after six month of occasionally use, the belt is coming apart at the notch hole,"
Ther 38 waist fits so large I cant wear these at all. If they get wet they fall of entirely
Falling apart after wearing the shoes twice!
These sandals come very narrow and we had to return them
Not big enough around to find out if cup size is right. Lets face it.. Im not a tiny person and will need more than one bra extender.
Impossible to close with eyelet closure..  Recommend velcrow.
"I like everything about the bag; style, material, etc. Butt he zipper broke on its first trip."
"I was very excited when I discovered this company was offering a boot, as I love my sandals.  However, they dropped the ball.  The buckle is fixed and is only decoration, it is extremely hard to pull on and then too wide so my foot slides around as I walk.  There is some kind of black rubbery flakes that come off on my sock and the boot bed isn't soft like the sandal, so they are not as comfortable for walking.  I would not buy again!"
"They fit but the material inside is made of wool & polyester. My feet need cotton because this slipper retains moisture. Now my feet are starting to itch. I noticed that when I put my foot in this slipper, they felt damp. But I didn't think anything of it until my foot started to itch. I never had this problem before. Will return!"
"This was my second pair of Vasque hiking boots. I LOVED my first pair and they served me well. I tried these on in the store and thought they were fine but they make me completely miserable if I hike more than 3 hours at a time. I kept trying to make these work so went past the time that I could return them. That was a big mistake for the cost. I don't trust Vasque now and have had a hard time finding new hiking boots. If you have a narrow foot, these might be ideal but if not, don't waste your money."
SO HOT! It's so so so hot!
"Not ultra low cut, still shows under my shoes. I have size 10 feet, I own two pairs of genuine ultra low cut liners and they never show. Not happy with these."
"This top isn't worth the dollar spent on it. It is very small and the ruched sides start at the very top of the shirt, thus making the top the shape of a triangle rather than a rectangle. I seen that others had complained about it being too small so I ordered up several sizes......still way to small. If I ordered the shirt 4 sizes larger, I still doubt the shirt wouldve been able to fit, it's really the cut of the shirt that makes it too small. More like a crop top."
MAL MATERIAL
I bought these to replace an existing pair that I LOVE. Lesson learned. Buy from a real store. They arrived with threads and the fabric straps pulled apart. I returned them and bought a new pair at the Sanuk store.
Cute.. but the neck line is VERY wide!
Not good iit doesn't meet my expectation..
My Dr. recommended these. I may not have gotten the pair that gave me the full support. But I was just so disappointed. I spent a good bit of money I had to work hard for and I really did not feel the support on my feet or in the arch. I felt like I was walking on street pavement all day barefoot. Maybe A different pair would have been better??? I had heard other that like them:( Bummer
this item was fake not a real north face product returned it right away
Bootcut??? Not to sure about that. Guessing I would call it a wide leg.
"It has taken me 5 months to finally write this review. Normally I would respond rather soon but I thought I would let this hat grow on me. Well, it hasn't budged at all. It is SO SO SO big it looks really unflattering. I even washed it and dried it in the dryer and it still looks bad. I think it is my head reallyI have a big one but this hat looks so nice on the model I was hoping it would look that way on me. WellI guess this hat will sit around and collect lots of dustmaybe someone will notice it and ask to have it."
"I bought these with 2 different pair (Angelina thermal and Royal Cult fleece) because it was hard to tell what was good from the reviews (I hate it......I love it, what do you do with that?).  I thought they would be more like thermal tights because I have some microfiber shirts and they are really soft and thick.  These are just tights.  They are kind of scratchy and thin, maybe a teeny bit thicker than panty hose and not softer than good quality panty hose.  They are not going to be specifically warmer than panty hose.  Also the waist is like a wasp waist.  I am sort of normal sized, not super skinny but not obese.  The waist was so tight it was really uncomfortable and doesn't look good with a dress or skirt.  So if you are looking for thermal tights that you could wear all day and feel fuzzy and comfortable, these are not the tights to get.  I think they are control top tights (hence the torture chamber sized waist) but it didn't really say that in the description.  FYI I am getting a couple more pair of the Royal Cults because they are really warm on cold winter days/nights."
This was purchased as a Christmas gift. The person who received it told me it does not keep them warm. They went back to their regular thermals! So sorry to hear this because this item was not cheap!!!!!
somewhat small!!you should select a bigger size
The top strap was to short for my son and kept being undone.
"band turn color ( bad, threw it away"
Did not cling to my feet enough to prevent tripping
"Thank goodness people take the time to write their reviews on an item.
I am reading that the picture shown is not the same as what you actually receive. That there are two extra rings between skulls...one large, one small.
More rings means less skulls, and would make the chain more like a ladie's biker necklace, not a dude's wallet chain.
A seller who uses a bogus pic to try and sell an item is being deceitful, in my opinion.
I came here to buy the item pictured, but not the one being described by these reviewers."
The arms and body fit great the neck line and straps don't work. They sat wrong on the shoulders. It looked great other than that.
"So happy when I finally got it, it took forever, it never worked. Time was frozen. Unfortunately I never learn, if it's too cheap....there is a reason..."
"Great size, design etc.  Outside pocket will not stay snapped with anything in it.  Might as well not have the outside pocket."
Way too warm.
"These shoes are not great water shoes. First, sand easily gets into the shoes and is hard to get back out. You have to take them off to remove sand. I use them for SUP and this is problematic as I often have to walk out a bit to get on my board.

My biggest problem however is that the back of BOTH shoes is ripping, and I have only worn them this season. I expected them to last more than a season. I only wear them as water shoes, and have probably worn them less than 10 times--so this seems like poor quality to me."
"I bought this set as a replacement while I waited to have my ring re-set.  Its very pretty, but it feels so light and I fear it will fly off my hand.  Definitely paid more than this thing is worth. :("
Quality was poor
Very small. Not what I expected.
My wear a size 6 so I ordered a size 6 as recommend. It is way too big! I walk right out of them. If I reordered a size 5 I think they would be big too. I recommend ordering at least a size smaller than you typically wear. I would say the quality of the shoes are good for water aerobics but not for the beach.
Too thick and too small. Ordering clothes online is really hit or miss.
"Honestly, I can't believe these are selling. Let's put even more technology on our kids. Athletic shoes were invented so humans could exercise more comfortably and with support for their joints and bones - which means kids should be actually ACTIVE and running around, not sitting down with their neck bent over developing tech neck. Yes google Tech Neck and see videos on you tube. Kids are getting hunched over necks from looking down at technology all the time. This invention is just ridiculous. Let kids be kids and run around and play with other kids, not looking down and pushing buttons on their shoes. Just idiotic."
The heel broke after wearing them for only a few hours.
I purchased this bag back in July. I barely used it for a month when both zippers broke and would no longer close. I had to wait a long time to find a zipper repair place and get it fixed. I picked the bag up today and was told that it is unrepairable! The zipper closure was sewn in wrong and came off the track and cannot be fixed!! I am so disappointed as I was so happy to find this bag! Buyer beware!
"They looked like grandpa underwear, WAY too big.  Order a size smaller"
"Pants of size and actual size deviation is large, rough workmanship, fabric is very hard, thread a lot"
Feathers came off!!!! Horrible!!
Their size are not accurate for U.S. Make sure you buy bigger size.
"When I put these pants on, I had major muffin hip.  When I pulled them up to get rid of muffin hip, I got camel toe.  The rise is too short unless you are rail thin, and the waistband is only about 1/2"" wide, not nearly sufficient to lay flat without cutting into the hips.  For point of reference, I am 5'7"", 150 lbs, size Medium in most stuff, or a size 8.  Not a big girl.  These pants were definitely not flattering on my body.  Since they took a month to be shipped from China, there was no returning them.  They went into the Goodwill pile.  Total waste of my money. :("
This  is not the headbands that I ordered no return slip in package I bought them for my granddaughter
"It is so cute, but the material is made out of fabric similar to a scuba suit! It is heavy duty and stiff, it does not fit or drape or move soft and flowy. If your're into stiff then this is perfect for you!"
"Don't recommend...I ordered a WAY bigger sz than I normally would, and STILL had to give it to my daughter, who is a sz 8!!!! Terrible sizing"
"This was a terrible bra that broke the 1st time I wore it, the underwire poked through and I returned it . Very poor workmanship do not buy"
"Way too large. I absolutely swam in this thing. It is mismatched, it just has to be. This thing wasn't even close to a 34DDD more like a 40DD. Shame, I really needed a convertible bra, and this one is so well priced."
"Too long on top. Rolls over.  Material loose . Doesn't fit nicely. Had to return.  The floral pattern can be seen thru
clothes."
"I ended up returning these socks because they were really tiny, lower rise than I wanted. They were more like low ankle socks. My kids wanted cool socks that would come up above their ankles and show them off, and these would not quite fit the bill."
It was really cheaply made for the price. My daughter couldn't breathe in it and ended up not using it.
"very uncomfortable, had to return"
"Ordered a medium, im normally a size 6. Medium was not fitted enough, should have ordered a small. Split is very high."
"I don't even know where to start these shoes are so awful. I usually love white mountain and cliffs flats. I wear them all the time. These fit nothing like the ones I have. The back was so narrow it pinched, while the rest of the shoe felt too long, almost like a size 9 and not an 8.
The return policy also isn't the best. It costs $5. But it was worth it to get rid of these horrible shoes. I purchased a pair of silver Anne Klein flats instead."
A little large for my feet but with 3E that is to be expected.
"My body is to blame as much as the dress, I suppose. It made me look like a wildly colored sausage. The dress was sent back. No second thoughts."
I really couldn't wait to get rid of this. It had a strong chemical smell. I t also fit strangely. Wide and short. Just nothing I can say to encourage anyone to buy this.
"I ONLY RECEIVED 5 PAIRS PLUS ONE EXTRA SOCK. MISSING ONE SOCK, AND THE ONLY CHOICE IS FOR A REFUND SO I'D HAVE TO MISS WORK TO TAKE IT TO THE POST OFFICE TO SEND BACK?!? NOT HAPPY. I JUST WANT THE MISSING SOCK!"
Zipper broke before tie was even worn.  Will exchange it and hope for the best.
Sooooooo tiny the 2xl was a small. Cute design
Not really feeling it..
They are so big they sag at the crotch and twist in the legs I normally wear a large but these are more like an extra large and when they stretch I can barely wear them I tried washing them but they don't shrink so in the future I would buy them again but I would buy a medium or maybe even a small other than that I like them
"You get what you pay for. Cheap quality, thin fabric, pipes way too long. If you don't expect much, I guess it will be okay."
As other reviews stated the sole came off the bottom of the shoe with in 8 weeks. I will not buy this brand again.
I'm Swiss. This DOES NOT represent Swiss made anything!  I bought this wallet as a gift once and it is NOT SWISS QUALITY!!  They think they can use the Swiss insignia and make people think it's fashionable and well made. Stier Scheie!
Very flared out and fits much like a tent.
"Toebox is tight, I'm generally a 9B, ordered (9 1/2B)..."
Poor quality of materials.
"I tried the small, medium and large, no size worked for me. I'm 5'7"" 135, 34b with hips and a butt. The small fit my bust, was too big with the first couple of side strings/cutouts and then the last two were just a bit too tight on my hips. The medium fit well at the hips but was too big everywhere else and the large was too big all over. The butt part is Brazilian so it doesn't offer much coverage if you have a butt. It is cute, two stars, and is white and blue, unfortunately just didn't fit in the right spots for my body type."
i got it for a specific skirt because I really hate slips. It works good with the skirt i needed it for.
"It's not soft or absorbent like a towel. I was looking for something more minimal, but this is like wrapping yourself in a long dress shirt."
LOL if you have arms for legs and wrists for ankles these are awesome. Waited over a month and these are like toddler capris. They also don't look like the photo. I'm a slender size 4 and these wouldn't come over my calves.
"First the ""3x"" is an XXXL per the tag on the garment.  A 3X is NOT the same as an XXXL.  The arms of this and the back part are extremely small.  The interesting part is there is a LOT of material for the front --- as if the front was a 3x!"
"The medium works if your chest size is 35 inches or less. Anything greater and the bibs need to be worn 4"" low and this puts the crotch 4"" low and makes walking more than a little awkward.

I gave these to friends with a 13 year old boy and they fit him perfectly."
"I wear a 42 D and I was so hoping for something that combined comfort with support that was more than a sports bra. Forget it. You can get cheap cotton sports bras at a discount store that fit exactly like this bra. There is no definition, so you end up with uniboob. Plus, the material is too elastic, so the girls are drooping by the end of the day. What a waste of $20!"
this thing is like a swamp. doesn't breathe at all. arms are dripping.
"The material of this shirt made my love handles extremely obvious, even under shape wear.  Every lump and crease was emphasized so I felt very uncomfortable wearing this even though I bought it large enough to hang loosely.  The material is very soft and looks super cute on the model.  I think if your in shape you will love this."
I got a medium and this product runs SO SO SMALL I'd probably need a XXX Large for any kind of comfort.  Nough said.  Very disappointed.
Couldn't possibly cover breasts of any size. I have a C cup but I believe this couldn't even cover an A cup. Big time design flaw!
They work great if you can stand the pain when you take them off !  I wore them once and threw them away.
"I would have loved this suit, if it hadn't been so short.  I am only 5'1"" and my torso is not very long...clearly, but I could hardly get the straps over my shoulders and when I did they were digging in.  Ended up returning the product."
Soo cute on but the straps broke off after the first wear even though they weren't tight or anything
"I have been wearing NB shoes for 15 years and they are not what they used to be. They are more cheaply made and smaller now. I normally get a 12d in the cross trainers. They are snug but acceptable. When I saw this model in my true size(12.5d) I was happy and I
ordered some. They just came and I was very disappointed. They are not as well made and are actually much smaller and narrower than the 12d that I have been wearing. Sending them back.  Will be looking for a new brand.

."
Way too tight around the arm holes. Returned it.
"nope wasn't what  I had expected for the price... oh well, I will still use it eventually."
Lights did not work
"I am 5'2, 126lb., and I wear a US size of 9/10. I got a medium and I couldn't get them over my hips. I would recommend u get a size up or a couple of sizes up to be comfortable."
Shoe quality is great.  I wear an 11-1/2 and bought 12 D.  Shoes are far too tight.  I estimate that I'd need at least a 13 to fit.  Big mistake buying shoes online!
"I've always been able to slip on SAS shoes and go.  This time my ""normal"" size was WAY small.  Returned."
Because of the stretch fabric these lost their initial attractive fit by the end of the first day's wearing. Can't recommend.
dsfagd
"I bought these boots last year in December.  Wore them 2-3 times per week through March walking in and leaving work (not all day). And maybe once per weekend as I ran errands.  This winter the weather has been mild and I've only needed boots a couple of times. Today I noticed that both soles are separating from the leather uppers where the upper toe bend is.  It seems that they are glued not stitched.  For $100 I expected these boots to last a lot longer.  Now I have to spend additional $$ to take them to the shoemaker for repair. There are plenty of good boot makers out there. I'm not sure that I would buy from Cobb Hill again.

Update:  Contacted the company. They are sending a $25 gift certificate because ""shoes generally fail within 30 days"".  More than one person here has mentioned the same problem.  I won't buy Cobb Hill again.  I've had Clarks and other brands that have last me years; I am not hard on shoes."
Fits well not too buggy...but material very week ripped on the second day....
"I wish I had read the reviews before I bought these--they are very tight in the front.  I have worn a 9.5 Nike for years, and these are just not comfortable.  Looking at the construction, there is a rigid piece over the top of the toes that does not give--the mesh portion further behind is fine, but your toes get cramped."
Wayyyyyyyy to small
"Horrible. Ordered a Medium, fits in the butt, sags in the front, the slits on the side show skin, the adjusters barely want to cooperate, and the fabric is a cheap kind that I can't even explain. Don't even bother, you will be paying to ship it back."
Ran small and the collar was tight
"The item is way to big, especially the waist and its not a waist that can be adjusted like most kids clothes."
Socks don't stay up very good
Will not buy again 2 small an extra lg fits like a medium
I've worn these shoes a total of 5 times. Last night on my way out of the office from work I noticed my left show felt funny. I looked down and the sole was falling off.
"This one particular pair had to have a defect on the right shoe because as soon as I put them on, the arch on my right foot started hurting. Walking around the house was hurtful, so I did not dare to run in them. I returned them. I got a different pair from a store, after trying them on, and had no issues. I can say it is a very nice shoe, airy and with a solid sole. It is really not good for running on asphalt/concrete or solid level surfaces, but on rough trails is great. It is not great for hiking."
"These are not wool at all, it says so on their packaging. Also, each pair had at least 1 hole in it somewhere, along with many many frayed strings. Super disappointed!"
I'm not able to wear the shoes they are just slightly too small. the right shoes somehow is pinching my big toe and both shoes squeak when I walk. I am very disappointed and am taking the shoes to Goodwill maybe someone can wear them.
The chest part of this is unusually small and and unsupportive. it's not proportionate to the sizing. Returning.
Sent these back.  Too big and the picture looked better than in person
"When I got them I put them on and the size was ok and then I gave them their first wash following the directions on the tag. THEY SHRUNK!!! Not a few inches but 6"" in length. Poor quality."
"I expected a swim cover-up.  What I got was a nightie, not something I would wear on the beach!"
It's difficult to explain but its too short in length and the overall top is too wide
Broke the first time my son wore it
"These shoes have a nice appearance, but run very small. I usually take a size 12, but upped the size to 13 based on reviews. They appeared to fit okay while trying them on, and felt comfortable, so I thought they would work. However, after an 8 hour shift on my feet, I came home with bruising under several toenails which I will probably lose. I might be able to wear them for short periods in the future, but that remains to be seen."
"I wear a size 4 or 6, ordered medium....would have maybe fit a prepubescent 10 year old...NOT exaggerating."
Looked kinda cheap. Just expected a little more srry.
Way too small. I ordered a large. If I was 12 it would fit great. I gave it to a 12 year old.
"It looks like a decent product, it's just way to small. Does not fit the sizing expectations at all. The Large is made for an american size 6."
"I bought these shoes for my dad for Christmas - he likes the old school, original black high top converses.  The ones that arrived were black in color, but they are some type of tweed/pattern.  You can't tell from a distance, but they're absolutely not canvas.  I'm sad that I'm not giving my dad the shoes he had as a teenager, but they'll be nice shoes for him anyway.  I'm not returning and receiving these again when they took longer than everything else I ordered to get here."
"These are very cheaply made shoes. You get what you pay for. I have only been wearing them for a season, not even daily, and the insole is peeling up out of the left shoe. In addition, the shoe runs at least a half size small. I bought these in a 10 and they are snug as a glove. I could not go any smaller, as my toes press the ends. Any smaller and I would have to return. They fit more like a 9.5 or even a little smaller. Also, the bottoms are not a normal rubbery material like you see on most tennis shoes. They are hard, slippery, plasticy material and are heavy."
Beautiful ring. Very light weight and shiny. My husband has been wearing it for a couple months and it has scratched so much. Such a shame.
"I was bummed because these shorts would not button when my husband put them on my five year old son but I bought the size I always buy for my son and he has a small waist. My husband left them on him since there is a belt and did not tell me so they were never returned. They are very cute but, if you buy a pair, you may want to try a size up and check to be sure they fit as soon as possible."
Very cheap material and fits weird.
I did not like the material on this shoe.  The material is an odd satin that reminded me of wedding dress shoes that people wore in the 80's.  I also thought the toe was too narrow.  I would not recommend this shoe.
"I wasn't expecting amazing quality from these little pouches, as they were only about a dollar or so. I got one in each color, as I thought I could use them as a card holder, or just to keep change. When I received them in the mail, each one was wrapped in plastic. Upon opening them I was hit with a VERY intense fishy odor. So strong in fact that I actually gagged. The wallets were obviously cheap-feeling, but would have been decent enough if they didn't reek like fish."
Waaaaaay to small. I couldn't get into them.
The bathing suit fit as expected however the straps were put weirdly on the top side of on the side like the picture showed so I returned it.  The company was easy to work with.
"Very cheap look, I was concerned the finish would scratch and scuff easily.  Do not like the look when it looks like the toes are lifted up."
"I love the shoes and I as well received many compliments.  When I walk the shoe cracks or squeaks.  I guess its the shoe not tearing.  I have worn them more than 3 times and mine have not fallen apart.  They are however water stained.  I wore them in the rain and they did not get damaged, and dried without spots.  The 2nd time I was caught in the rain I wasn't so lucky.  I have dark brown water spots all over the shoes now.  Its not super noticeable so I still wear them, however it seems like every third time I wear them and water is near the water does not dry out leaving my shoes spotted like a Dalmatian."
"They look very nice and comfy. However, they are just small compared with other Sketchers I have owned, seem narrow in the toe."
Very light. I bought them to turn into prescription glasses but they are too flemsey. Can't support the lenses.
"Sizes are very inconsistent. Had trouble with the sizes in the past as well.  Inserting a picture of our son's old belt and new one right out of the mail today.  The old one is a size LG and the new one is a size XL.  As you can see in the picture, they are virtually the same size.  Maybe 1/16 of an inch difference.  We needed a larger belt and got the exact same size with a different tag on it."
began to tarnish after 90 days...
"I returned this shoe, so I cannot comment, except to say they were too large."
"These are not good,they slide down under your jeans, skirts tights, etc."
Jeans didn't fit the way I thought they would. Look more like flared pants than boyfriend style.
not adjustable bracelet but they actually look nice. i haven't use it and plan to return it but change my mind. I'll just give it to my sister who  has bigger wrists.
Way too small. Had to give it away.
"Not slouchy. Tight, thick fabric, small hat."
"If you are large chested don't order this one! Super tiny cups that were fairly rigid so I couldn't even get away with trying to squeeze in. Bottom fit well, wasn't worth the hassle to return."
"The material is HORRIBLE.  It is exactly like an umbrella - yes, you read correctly, an UMBRELLA!"
"comes way too small. looks better in the picture. gave it away as sending it back would cost more. hard to iron as well, very wrinkled after the first wash. forget it"
Junk. Poor quality.
"Not sure what they meant by ""Twin Set"", but mine came single without the under ""dress""/lining...SO, unless you already have a strapless bandeau, knee length dress to go with this lace overlay, OR, are ok with wearing a lace dress without a lining, which I am not, This doesn't do you a lot of good! One bothersome thing about this is, I remember reading others that received this the same way.  Doesn't say good things when this happens repetitively."
"These locks are NOT TSA APPROVED. Flight from SFO->MSP->DCA, lock was broken off (they couldn't use their TSA keys!) and I was left with a note saying my lock was broken off and bag was inspected. Will NOT purchase and highly advise NOT purchasing these. Will return the SINGLE lock I have left!"
"Sadly, I threw it away the same day it came to my door. CHEAP product, waste of money."
"After owning these for 2 months, I am already wearing out the tread to the point of a smooth surface. These shoes don't have great support for high arches, the material feels cheap. Though light, I wouldn't say that they have much cushioning. Would be ok if these were $50 shoes but no way are they worth the price."
really disappointed. I wear and 8 in every pair of Aerosoles I own. These were very tight
"Dark Grey looks brown - not dark grey, but these came all the way from China (which I didn't notice, otherwise I would  have never ordered them), so I'm just keeping them instead of dealing with shipping them back. However, very disappointed in the product. The leg warmers really are NOT very nice."
I like the look.  Didn't have my size to return.  I'll keep them and wear legwarmers or something.
do not like this brand...
Sole separated from the upper on both shoes; sole split.  Wore them about 5 times.
WAY TOO NARROW
"Bought these for several pieces of luggage to take on a trip to Alaska with several plane changes.  By the time we returned home, several of these tags were missing.  The bands that you use to attach them with are not secure.  I knew when we put them on that they were not going to stay, but didn't have time to figure out something else to use."
"Hollow heels! The fit, look, and overall quality of the boots are great but the heels are hollow! You can only walk on pavement and pray you don't step on a pebble! I mean it's really hollow! There is almost no support and it squishes in on the heel when you walk. I am a light person too slightly under average weight. They should at least tell you that the boot has a hollow heel! I wouldn't recommend these! They are really cute and fit well but for almost 80 bucks it is ABSOLUTELY not worth it!

I am really disheartened with this purchase! I most likely can't get much use out of these because you really can only wear them for fashion but walking in them probably isn't a good idea at all! Everything about the boot is great except the heel support. I don't know if I received a defective set or what but it's really sad because it's hard to find such a cute rain boot! But I can hardly walk in them because the heel just squishes in."
Sandals looked cheap and wouldn't stay on my feet (I have a narrow foot). Returned them.
Lightweight and comfortable.  I haven't had them long and won't be keeping them because of the zipper.  It's a quality YKK zipper but there is nothing to keep the zipper up.  Most boots like this have a velco strap across the zipper but these don't  These shoes unzip walking from my bedroom to my front door. These are useless because they won't stay tight.
"They were a little too large. This is my second attempt at purchasing these and I will have to have them altered as the waist line isn't true to size. They do look as pictured however. I would rate them higher but knowing I will have to spend at least $15 to have them altered on the waist and cuffed and hemmed at the bottom, I cannot. At least they were prime shipping and arrived quickly. The length was waaaay too long."
Actually 2 1/2 stars.....All right I understand you get you what pay for....but come on the mustache included isn't even close to the product image. Will have to trim off part of the beard and attach to mustache.
"I have very narrow feet, so it's difficult to find shoes that my feet don't swim in. These shoes, however, were so narrow that I could barely put my foot in it and they hurt the minute I stood up. Maybe I received a defective pair. ???? I returned them. Beautiful shoe though."
I am returning this jacket. It looks very cheap. I found a similar one at Target that is much better quality. The paint from the shell transferred against the green from where it was folded. The jacket is very thin. The color is a weird green. The upside to this one is that the Target jacket doesn't have the cool mesh eyeband area. I can't imagine this will hold up in the wash.
Disappointed in small size.  I should have paid attention to other reviews telling of the same.
The shoe was comfortable but too large for my narrow to medium sized feet.  I wanted the shoe to fit snug to my fit. (Too bad... very cute shoe!)
"I LOVE the look of the shoe and WISH it was comfortable. I couldn't wear them for more than 15 minutes of light walking because the blue strip that goes out to the toe of the shoe rubs the tops of my toes HORRIBLY!! If I'd have warn them for even an hour, I'm positive I would've had a blister and/or bleeding toe. I hated to send them back because they were really neat looking and really liked the colors. However, if they don't fit, they don't fit. I do think I had the correct size as I DID order a half-size larger after reading others' reviews. I might could have even gone a whole size larger. Whoever designed the shoe just didn't take into account how that blue insert deal could/would rub the top of peoples' toes."
Cute and a great piece but using the zipper was awkward. I ended up giving it away.
Unfortunately the bra does not fit. I usually do not have any problems ordering online but I have found that it is hard to order bras online for myself. I think it is mostly personal preference.
"I said these shoes were somewhat small ,but that was only part of the problem. They were too small in the toe box and they were so loose in the heel area that my feet would slip out with each step. I wanted to like them because they were lightweight and looked good, but I had to return them."
cheap material....
"THE BOOTS HAVE PROBLEMS:  I took my old boots to be repaired. They needed new soles. The repair shop wanted $55.00 plus tax to install new soles. Recently, I paid him $45.00 plus tax to repair the heels. I calculated that I could buy the NEW Giorgio Brutini 80575 for less then the repair price. So, LOGIC prevailed (I thought).  If the Giorgio Brutini's work out, I will give the old boots to charity. I really never thought of these as ""Beetle"" boots. They are just plain toe dress boots which are really hard to find. You can find a really nice looking western style boot if you like the stitching, but formal occasions require a plain toe dress boot and it looks like the Giorgio Brutini's 80575 would fit nearly every occasion.  These boots look great BUT only for a little while, the heel starts to wear and the white plastic that the heel is made of appears AND the toe will turn up and put a crease at the toe making the boot look strangely deformed.  THAT SMOOTH TOE LOOK IS GONE.  I took them to a boot shop to have the rubberized heel plate replaced and was told that the plate is glued on and it will eventually wear down to the white plastic again. I asked if he could replace the entire heel and I was told that could not be done at a reasonable price.  The toe problem was resolved with heat and reshaping.  So I am looking for glue on heel plates so I can keep some handy.  My decision to buy these boots would have been very different if I had know the composition of the heel and the poor quality workmanship of the boot. I don't know why people are giving these boots such high marks, I did not find the long term quality to be there, but then again the low price is in accordance with the low quality. BTW:  There really is no return policy on these boots from the vendor that I purchased them from.  I WOULD NOT BUY THESE BOOTS AGAIN AT ANY PRICE..."
"the top was all padding, i am not a large chested person and there was absolutely NO way to fit into the top..returned with no problems.."
"The shoe fit nice and felt great, however there is little to no grip on the ground and worse even is the SPD cleat stick down from the tread making these shoes uncomfortable to walk in.  Perhaps these shoes are best suited to racing.....?"
The arms are really tight around the cuff. Poorly sewed together especially the arms as they felt like they were twisted. You get what you pay for.
Flimpsy and low quality
"Awful, don't waste your time or money on this."
"it fits but your feet stay wet in these for sure, and that is even when you are walking in grass that has dew on it early in the morning, in a rain storm these certainly won't stand up to anything, they are more like sandals than sneakers, the price is too high for the quality"
"part didn't work, had to return.  When they say it is big, obnoxiously so."
It was really constricting and uncomfortable. It hugged my hips. I didn't even try and wear it to workout. I feel like lifting would be really uncomfortable in this
just weird. tight in the thigh. too loose in the waist. rides too low in the waist. when i sit the back pulls down to show more skin than I like.
These wee a good price but unbelievably uncomfortable.
Broke on day two! Not worth the money! No stars but they will not let you do that ! So the only star you get from me is a star rating not earned! So it doesn't matter!
it was way to to Small I even put it on a tiny friend & it didn't fit her:((
"The blue color is all wrong. It's too dark and doesn't look like the picture. Also, the crop top is way too short and tight. The letters crack when you wear it."
"Bag was smaller than I expected.  My iPad did not fit properly and the lining was not fitted to the purse, so it was too big and kept sliding down inside the purse.  Pockets that held other items would end up on bottom of purse with things sitting on top.  I was very disappointed.  Had to return it."
Wayyy too small. And poor quality. Looks like a shirt I might find strolling through a Chinatown convenience store.
"Based on its reviews I had high hopes for this bag when I bought it for a trip. It does have lots of pockets, but it's just waaaay too small. My things DO fit but the bag bulges out like a balloon--not a pretty sight--and I don't carry that many things! I wish some of the inside pockets had some type of closure: Those pockets always make putting my wallet in a challenge. If you don't care about aesthestics, buy this bag: It's not pretty but it's light, secure, has lots of pockets, and the handle is very adjustable. For me it's too small and too ugly. Too late to return, will give to a charity."
"The rings seems  that are bigger, and the quality are bad,  the balls are not tightened
I'm very disappointed with this buy. ,"
It is small and it doesn't fit the way I had read about it. I would suggest order a size up. Also washed it and its ok but you do need to iron it for it to look nice.
Runs sooooo small. I got a 7 1/2 which I normally wear and couldn't even get my foot in. So dissapointed :(
Very good looking shoe however I easily wore these shoes out very quickly. The sole is cheaply sewn in. I bought two styles from this maker and experienced the same issue.
"Super small.  I ordered a size 14-16.  Good lord, it wasn't even close, I mean a huge difference in size.  Way too small.  The large I received resembled a toddler large, not a boys large.  I am stuck with it because I missed the return window (my fault - we were on vacation) so I guess I threw away $26."
"sent back.  Too small, too tight.  Wish they come in wide."
Disappointed I ordered a size bigger for my daughter it did not fit
"The Pros: The bag is a good size for what I carry in it, nice color and like that you can zip it. Cons: It could use a front zipper pocket, it would not be worth paying the original price of $188, the sides are not very sturdy--it tends to collapse inward/outward all around even when the purse is full."
"I too wish I had read the low ratings before ordering these.  I did give two stars because they fit and feel good.  However, by simply brushing a little snow off my car door to gain entrance, it soaked right through and the gloves were completely wet on the inside."
"I am a 5,6 135lb and I ordered a large because the reviews said the product ran small and yet it came and was still WAY too small. I am a 36 C and the top would fit only maybe a 36 B or A. Also the bottom was too tight around my hips. I normally wear a medium on the Bottom and a large on the top yet the large in both didn't fit AT ALL. The material was a decent texture though."
I'm a small and ordered a size M  It is so big on me  I had to return it
I was very disappointed in the quality/build of this carry-on spinner. I used it for the first time this month on a trip and I found a large crack on the outer shell within the first few days of my trip. I did not check in the bag. I carried it on to all my flights. I purchased this carry-on trusting that it would be strong and last for many years. I will not be buying from Delsey again.
I suppose it would work nicely under a loose fitting sweater but it is very bulky under a fitted shirt. I do not like at all.
"I wore them once (<40 min. of walking) and got bloody, open wounds on the back of my ankles from them."
"sizing is an issue with this shoe, returned twice because at first was too small, than too large. Not sure how to recommend because everyone's feet are different. It is a good looking shoe, can't attest to the comfort since didn't get to wear them. They are really narrow as well."
I have had these shoes for 4 months only. They do not stand up to daily use. The soles are coming apart. I will be seeking other shoes that have some durability to them.
This tie is shades of lavender.  It's in my clothing donation pile.
"It would have been nice if the product actually matched the picture. Not worth returning, since it came in a big box with other stuff and there's no UPS drop off within 50 miles of me. Next time: Walmart."
"I ordered this dress for my daughter for Christmas.  It didn't arrive until 5 days before, though I had ordered it more than a month ahead.  While the dress seemed to be fine when I first took it out of the package, it fit oddly when she put it on--too big up top and too tight in the bodice.  And, it was too long (my daughter is 5' 6"").  Further, the zipper tab broke off immediately.  Disappointed."
Mold smell would not wash out. Very strong moldy smell as soon as I opened the package. Never experienced such a thing with any of my orders. Wool was extremely itchy feeling to the touch.
"My son purchased these with a birthday gift card. "" Oh Boy, Can't Wait, Cool Shoes"". When they came he was very pleased. Within a week, he was very disappointed. The interior of the shoe delaminated. Worthless. Amazon was very good about the return and refund. Go to Walmart where a kid can wear out a pair of shoes, instead of watching them fall apart, for half the price."
The picture definitely looks better than the actual item.  Disappointed overall..
"I love the picture of this dress...

I ordered plus size and when I tried it on, it was NOTHING like the picture. The dress went down to almost my ankles!! I thought I had ordered a too large of size, but it fit my top half great. Perfect in the bust, arms and waist. But the length was all wrong and weird.

Very disappointed.
I returned it."
Hated the material! I had to give them away :(
"Really cheap quality. Exposed threads and seams everywhere.  It looked like it would fall apart immediately. Can't imagine putting this on a squirmy, active baby. The ""blanket"" was really stiff and had a chemical smell. Returned."
"I'm not sure how Teva does their measurements but it's different than Speedos.  The size run small about 1/2 on the Teva's.  I wear an 8 and If I wear socks it's a tight fit and my toes touch the front quite a bit. The Speedos have room for socks by a good 1/2 inch.

Size issue aside, If you are planning to wear these walking or hiking for a long period, I recommend you wear socks. The inside stitching around the laces area will scratch the top of your feet.  It's one solid piece on top and no tongue so the stitches are not covered.  But with socks, it'll be tight length wise so you might want to consider ordering a size up.  In water (without socks obviously), since you are probably not gonna be doing a lot of walking in water, the stitches might not bother you much.  Also, keep in mind, the laces do not lock.  So it can come lose after a while and you will need to retighten.  You could cut the loop and just tie it like normal laces if you are too concerned about this.

As far as style, it looks like your standard tennis shoes and they feel like it when you put them on.  With socks, I can probably wear these all day.  Good feet support and is very light."
Runs small even though it was advertised as a wide. Don't buy if you really need a wide.
Hoops are very thick.  Returned both packs.
Ive purchased several pair of these and never had any issues until now. Love the pants but these i wore once and they are ripped and rivets are falling off. Attempted to contact seller and haven't received a response.
I am a size 18 and ordered a 2x. The dress fit my size 12 sister. I can't comment on the smaller sizes but the bigger sizes are way too small.
"Although the fabric seems sturdy enough, there was a large hole in one of the pockets. I am replacing the item."
This backpack began loosing parts right after we got it!! They come un-sewn and fall off (ears and zipper attachment). One netted side tore quickly. Would not recommend!
"I'm reposting my original review because the seller (China) decided to take down the storefront and put up a new one. Also, they keep moving this hat to different storefronts and posting fake reviews on it. Note how they do not show it on a real person. It smells like toxic chemicals and it really does ship on ""the slow boat from China"".  The price is too good to be true because this hat really is garbage.
Here is my original review that was taken down (see screen capture that I attached):
I wanted to love this but there were 2 problems with it. It smelled like chemicals as noted by another reviewer, and it does not completely cover the neck. I have washed it once and that helped a little bit but it still smells - not very conducive to putting it over my nose and mouth and breathing through it. If it were about an inch or 2 longer, that would improve the design. The rest of the design is good. I suppose it is worth the price. I would pay more for one that has a generous neck warmer and made from nice fabric that does not smell toxic.

UPDATE: After thinking about this and the fact that the hat is unwearable, I went in and checked some of the 5 star reviews on this hat. Apparently, some are phony. You just need to look at some of their other reviews to see that the reviewers repeated the same review for every product and that they were all on the same date. I also found this exact product selling under a different store and the ""real"" reviews talked about how horribly bad this hat is, how it smells like gasoline and how it was shipped directly from China. Do not buy this hat is you want something that is safe to wear and fits. Yes, it shrinks down a bit and could fit a child, but I would never subject anyone to wear this. I was going to donate it to Goodwill but now, in good conscience, I will toss it. I really dislike deceptive practices and shoddy, unethical manufacturing processes.
Comment"
"thin, not palazzo but bell bottom, one leg longer"
VERY SLACK
The material used for this product is very cheap and the hat looks pretty cheap as well. But the seller was very good about the return.
"The package was received in a bag that had been cut open along the bottom seam.  Website states this 62% Cotton, 35% Polyester, 1% Rubber, 1% Nylon, 1% Spandex.  Package stated 75% Polyester, 22% Cotton, 1% natural latex rubber, 1% spandex , 1% nylon.  Item returned."
"Usually I like a looser fit, but this was way too large."
Fits small and no stretch at all! Fits tighter across the bust area and fuller at the bottom. If you're flat busted it may work fine.
"This is about the fifth pair of Earth sandals I have purchased and I would have to say it is the worst.  This sandal does not even come CLOSE to the fit, and quality of my last four pair.  The straps are cheap and flimsy, the Velcro barely holds and the shoe does not feel comfortable at all.  I am very disappointed in it and if I had not worn it already I would definitely have returned it.  Earth has ruined its sandal line in my opinion.  Something very bad for a shoe that was so superior to other shoes I would never wear anything else for years but now I am forced to start shopping around again for another brand.  I would NOT recommend this shoe if you are a fan of Earth shoes."
These were too narrow for me. I had to send them back
They are 3 sizes smaller then labled
"These might work for kids boots, however, they don't even come close to fitting on my regular adult size boots. I cannot fathom what this company is thinking about. I also don't understand how the other reviews say these are good. Maybe they fit ladies boots, but, definitely not man's cowboy boots. They actually are pretty cool. And that makes it even more tragic because they are so cool but this company makes them so short. I am returning them. I do not advise buying them if you're an adult male with adult male boots because I don't see how they are possibly going to fit."
My 5 year old son finds them extremely painful to wear. The straps are not as comfortable as on other Teva models.
Too small and same brand cheaper at walmart
"Buy with caution: I got fakes, sold and fulfilled by Amazon.

I have an affinity for Frye boots and own a few pairs. I've tried on the Melissa Button boot before-- my sister owns them in the same size I wear, so I know exactly what to expect in terms of quality of craftsmanship, quality of leather, size, and fit. The boots I received were lacking in all types of quality, and were so small I could barely get my toes past the ankle, let alone my foot into the boot. They appeared to have been scaled down entirely, as they also were not as tall as they should have been. The workmanship on the sole was visibly sub-par. They arrived in a generic box (not a Frye branded box).

I know these are wonderful boots when they are real, which is why I bought them. I was surprised to find my Amazon purchase (again, sold by and fulfilled by Amazon, not a third party) was not a genuine item. I can only assume someone bought the real deal and returned these fakes for a credit. I don't know how else such an obvious fake could have gotten into Amazon's stock."
Do not buy this crap. It is made with the cheapest material they can possibly find. Never again will I ever buy the brand Dickies.
"These shoes fit great on day 1-20. Adorable shoe style...however, then they didn't fit right on my right foot in the arch. The feeling got worse, my foot hurt every day for 7 more days, even with Dr. Scholl's work inserts!! So I tossed them. I work 12 hr nights standing and walking, I need reliable shoes...."
I was very disappointed for I thought by the picture that this was the style I have had in the past and they were not and also a bit small.
These are poorly made version of Clark's
Too hot for me.
This is not the bag I received.
"To start off,  i have perchased several inexpensive lingerie items on Amozon.com that came from somewhere in China.  As usually started in reviews, they tend to be made for very petite women, but since my wife is petite that it's a problem. Also, the quality of the items is usually mediocre, which is to be expected based on the prices.  This item however takes the cake.  If it's by far the cheapest and most poorly sewn and misshapen clothing I have ever seen.  The sizing was very odd.  For example, the leggings where extremely short compared to the width.  All over the measurements were off or uneven."
"I am disappointed in the wacoal bras the past two years, they don't seem to be made the same and I've had bra clips just snap off, hooks fall apart- they used to be great but the workmanship isn't the same"
These socks used to be amazing.  They used to make an XL but I wore a L because the Large was even pretty big. Now they no longer make the XL and the L is much smaller than what it used to be.  What was once a great product at a great price they now suck.
The size definitely runs very small. Does not fit who they were intended for.
"Wow it's tiny, order up a couple sizes! I wish i had followed the reviews i read when i ordered it."
"hubby doesn't like that the buckle keeps coming open, but nice quality on belts."
"i do not write reviews, but i read them and i want to make sure that LillaP gets the message - charging $98 for an awful thin piece of cotton is wrong. i made tons of purchases from Amazon, but never sent nything back. i donate it if i do not like it. this one is going back."
Too narrow in the toe box. Ouch. Had to send them back.
"I love how modest this swimsuit is but it is not built with bigger chested women in mind, even if you buy the larger size. I spent the whole time wearing this adjusting myself so nothing popped out."
Heed my words and do not buy. Chesp and too small
Recd martial used and damaged
"While  they arrived I time, they were made for very large arms out of inexpensive material and I could not get them to stay up on my petite arms they constantly rolled down my arms. Very awkward. Since they were always bunching on me they provided no additional warmth and I had to basically throw the away as they were useless. Very disappointed in this purchase. I have a pain disorder and rely on gloves and arm Warmers for extra warmth and these did absolutely nothing since they couldn't even stay one arms. Forget about just looking cute, they didn't do that either. Wouldn't stay up!! Just a touch of elastic would have helped at the top or just a different type of fabric than the cheap fabric used."
"This is the scarf I ordered bit it's not the one I got. The one I received is two toned, no fringe at the end and very unattractive. Also very cheap material. Very very unsatisfied!!!!"
"Very thin material, not thick like tights normally are.  Its like wearing nylons, but a little thicker.  Very disappointing."
Do not buy this dress.. cheap material.. waiting for refund..
"It seems that this pack of socks is different than the ones sold individually.  They seem to be smaller, and have less anti-slip material on the bottom."
I wore these shoes which were tight on my size 7 and they also wore very quickly on the inside and within only a few months had a very bad scent to them. I tried many methods but it didn't work so ended up throwing out after 6ish months. Cute and trendy but not great for long term.
Had to return these are the seam/stitching on the gloves started coming apart after one use which wasn't anything intense.  I was so disappointed because they were very warm and definitely waterproof.  It could have just been a defective item but still disappointing.
"it looks nice, but it is not water resistance as i got some water inside the watch, but the watch is still working till this moment."
Not very comfortable but cute
Horrible fit for anyone not having an A or B width.
"Really stiff,uncomfortable to wear.."
"Received them today, nothing like the picture, there are laces up the legs and they are cotton, not a knit, these will definately go back if there were negatives I would use them to score this one"
"Extremely small watch, looks like it is made for a female not a male."
Will have to return this as it is cut too small. I always wear a Small but this I will have to return. Tight under the arms. Quality is good but sizing is off.
"the shirt was not fitted, it was larger than planned. i wore it once and do not plan on wearing it ever again."
"This item is advertised as a ""comfort fit,"" with three inch expandable waist.  What is not advertised is that it has a tighter ""seat"" and leg than normal.  This is, however, prominently declared on the attached tag.  Thus, though the waist fit fine, it was very tight in the seat.  It is a wonder who want want an expandable waist and a comfort fit with a tight seat.  Makes no sense."
I wanted to love these shoes - but they just didn't work.
The reason I dis like this bra is the under wire comes right under my are pit so I constantly have a wire sticking in my arm pit. Other than that it fit fine but I really hate the wire under my arm pit
"I should have read the reviews.  These shoes were not only too small, they were really too small. I couldn't even get them on with peds let alone a running sock. They were returned the next day.  Very disappointing because all of my asics fit really well in my size.  They missed the mark on this one."
"Horrible design/knockoff of the shirt in the pic. Super sheer cheap material and flimsy straps, does not hang properly at all. I am unable to wear this and have no use for it."
Returned this yellow bag as well. Didn't care for the color.
"Purchased for a friend (last minute decision/purchase) whom loves her kitty, so I was excited when I found this as a gift option for her.  Read the reviews and all seemed neutral.  I ordered, and got it the day I was due to see her.

To my disappointment, it was super, super tiny.  When she opened it, she thought that it was just a stand-alone pearl; I had to point out that it was a pearled-kitty.  This is how tiny it is... I can say that it's cute but would be cuter if it were slightly bigger.  In my opinion, not worth more than $14.99 (i paid $26!! yuk).  Wait to see if the price drops."
D34 its not true to size im falling out everywhere. Wish I could contact the seller to exchange it for a bigger size cause the bra feels nice and looks nice.
Very sturdy and nice links
It seems like the top is a size or two smaller than the bottoms.  A full C cup spilled out all over.
"not comfy, and after wash it basically destroys them"
"poorly made
only gave it one star cause I had to"
Colors were no where near pictured. Returned.
"These looked wonderful. However, I have very painful arthiritis in the top of my feet.  These shoes just added too much pressure to the top of my feet.  Had to return.  Did not get any credit on my charge for these?  I have requested a reason."
"Shame,shame. Not only was it the wrong size, it had a hole in it. Not a hole in a seam or anything, a real hole."
The brown color is women's stocking material -too sheer and unusable for the baby when it was bought. She never used it and has already outgrown it. Waste of money. Misrepresented these as footed baby tights comparable to the fabric tights available in other colors.
This shirt leaves dye stain on the skin.
Too lite. make a fine pack strap but not worth a darn as a belt.
"You get what you pay for. Go cheap get cheap. Complete waste of money.
Too small, they look cheap."
"These  are really nice suspenders, large enough for a tall or large man and very comfortable.  The clips are strong and hold the trousers properly under strain.  The workmanship and quality of the materials seems very good too.  My only complaint about these suspenders is that I found others on Amazon that I like just as much for less than half the price.  The WDSKY  brand suspenders can be found and my experience with them is just as good.  If cost is not the primary factor, this is an  excellent choice.

Update December 8 2016.  After three months of daily use, the two front clips have come loose and they constantly pop off my trousers.  I have to fold the fabric over to ensure there is enough for the clips to hold tightly.  It's unfortunate because I really like the style of these suspenders and they seemed to be very well made."
My son wanted to get same shoe he had but one full size larger.  The full size larger was way too narrow compared to his previous shoe.  We sent this one back and ordered the 4D extra wide.  I'll update this post if this shoe comes in and fits properly.
"I am 5'7"" 140lb 34C and the large was still a bit small.  I'm not super busty but I was still worried about staying covered - maybe it would be better for shorter women."
They got a run with in minutes of putting on... These are cheap
I want to get a pair my size but its so much trouble to replace them.
"I went by chart carefully!  Read all comments and thought if I went up 2 sizes I'd be ok.  No.  Hate returning items due to mobility issues..  this maker offered a ridiculous $6.00 for me to keep.  No way. Pay $30 and getting back $6.00 is crazy. So I will have to go thru the hardship of returning.... Not happy with the whole thing being a waste of time and energy.  Material was nice, but the dresss not made right as far as fitting goes.  Don't waste your time!"
"I wanted to like these, but my first complaint was that it was supposed to be a 3 pack with varying colors. I got a package with all 3 of them being black. Not a huge issue, but I like having different colored boxers. My main complaint on these was how the back of the boxers sat. The boxers would not sit up as high as I like them. The band kept sliding down immediately and would rest with the top of the band right at the top of my butt crack. It was not comfortable with them sitting there. The bottom of the boxers also were not tight around my leg above my knee, they were loose, which I didn't like."
"This wallet is WAY TOO BIG!!! I wish I knew it was as thick, tall and stiff. Very hard to comfortably fit in all of my back pants pocket."
"Finally received my watch and it's broken, second hand stuck"
"The elastic around the top of the boot that tightens them to the legs broke the third time we put them on :( As a snow boot, the elastic is pretty important to keep the boots on tight so snow won't get inside them... very disappointed."
"The umbrella works and physically looks nice, but the color isn't even remotely close.  I would not have purchased this for my wife if I knew it was dark purple!"
But I'm a father in my six-year-old daughter would never be caught dead posing like this even if I was to be paid for at me and her mother were just looking at these disgusted why are these little girls posing like this like they are grown adults parking near lips out and bending their bodies out  with promiscuous facial expressions
"It was not what I expected, look like something to wear beneath clothing not alone."
"Even though this product did not fit as described, the customer service at David's bridal were not at all helpful, would not work with me about what might be a better fit, nor would they pay for return shipping. I will not buy from David's again."
"I ordered 4 of these in various colors. Two of these (XXL) I returned as being way too small. The black one (XL) I passed along to my teenage grand daughter. She is a Med and this XL fit her well. The grey one (XXL) I gave to my daughter. She's a US size 10-12 and this XXL fits her nicely. A size US 14 could wear this, but it'd be clingy and revealing.

On the plus side, it is a nice light weigh knit that can be worn almost year round."
"When I decided to wear the jeans, one zipper is stuck, impossible to open. Since it has been 30  days I can not return it. Carhart jeans were a favorite. No more."
"These boots look really cheap, shiny, and almost like plastic. This is a wide fitting boot and was way too big for my narrow feet. The bottoms were very slippery so make sure to rough the bottoms up before wearing."
"This bra runs tight in the band and gave me a very retro, pointy, looking bust.  Not good."
"The Necklace, pantyhose, and gloves were missing from packaging."
Cute shoes! Atleast 3 sizes too small.
the fit was off. it didn't fit well around the chest area
Leg holes are HUGE! Bits fall out of them.
Nice soft cotton but the size is horrible. The elastic is so tight !!! My baby hates when I tried to put over his head - the elastic is so hard and thick that hurts his head and belly because it has a pressure on it. I would never recommend this product. When you pick up the baby the diaper will show on ... Waist of money
"This is false advertisement. The product was cheaply made and plastic, there was no 18k electroplating at all, it wasn't even metal. It was a piece of plastic and even the band was worn and eroding. It was painted to look gold and the paint was peeling from the product. I'm filing an investigation against this seller and contacting Amazon corporate. Worst product I have ever ordered on here,  period!"
"If you are looking for a jewelry piece that is nice looking then this watch will give you that ,however on the other hand, if you want a piece that you can look at without straining to see what time it is then this is NOT the watch. The seconds bar is red and easy to read. The hour and minute hands are very difficult to read since they are a slim shaped and silver against a black background. The day display is very unique, easy to read with the white background. The overall size of the watch is nice and the band is comfortable.  While the design is attractive the functionality of the watch failed for me. If it takes me effort  to move my wrist around so the light hits the watch just the right way so I can see what time it is, then it fails my test!"
"Honestly I thought this would shrink like any other tee shirt that I buy but It has not shrunk (washer only, air dried outside) The shirt looks and feels and fits as if it was brand new after a few washes which says a lot for clothes now a days. I will be purchasing more since these do not shrink.

UPDATE 3/27/16: After buying about a half dozen of these over a year and a half or so, I have come to discover as a few other reviewers have that these all depend on where they are made. Some come from Honduras, some from Mexico etc. Depending on where they come from, they fit differently. I have had to throw them out except ones made in Honduras and Guatemala. The Mexico ones shrunk up and this is with no dryer, just air drying they got really short-cannot wear them any longer so in the trash they went."
Received the wrong item all together. The romper is cheaply made and quite large for being aimed at newborn. Cheaply made cheaply designed
There is glue on the inside of the sandle which it hitting the side of my foot and is very uncomfortable..Cheaply made and I would not buy again.
"The material is ok considering the price. It's very light and good for a summer hat. However the size is not right. The label on the plastic bag says the size is Large/X-Large, but the label on the hat itself says Size: Small. And the hot does feel small, at least far smaller than a regular large/x-large."
"After one wear, the seam is separating in the rear.  I'm returning mine."
"I figured people were exaggerating and I should trust Amazon sizing on this somewhat. Wrong. Their xx large is not a x large, as they claim. It is actually a US medium. I would have liked this shirt some years ago when it would have fit."
"Unfortunately I had to send this back.  It was waaaay too small.  The quality was nice and I liked the feel of the fabric but it really was just too small, like suffocating small.  I usually wear a M in misses.  This was like a sausage casing!  If you are going to get it, order 3-4 sizes up!"
I have worn this necklace for about 2months and it is no longer bright and shiny. Very disappointed. Waste of $!!!!!
"The top portion of this suit is very, very small. I'm not sure who it would fit other than a child or perhaps someone with A cups although I'm still not sure it would have adequate breast coverage for an adult."
Unit came and is cheaply made. The worse part is it wouldn't even turn on
"I usually wear a women's xl in tops, this too was huge!!  If it would have gone over one shoulder like pictured it would have been very flattering.  Like others have said it does not go over a shoulder, it's just a regular crew neck.  The fabric was great & the pattern was beautiful.  I was very disappointed."
"I ordered a Large.  I am 6' and 195 lbs, and wear a 31 inch inseam.  These pants were much too long for me.  I did not measure the inseam prior to repackaging them for return, but the pants' bottoms folding under my feet and made walking in them dangerous."
It did not provide the support desired.
"INITIALLY I THOUGHT THIS PANTS CAME HUGE... I'M A SIZE 4 AND ORDERED A SIZE 4. TRIED IT ON AND ITS 6X TOO BIG. GAVE IT TO SOMEONE THAT WAS A SIZE 12.. LOOKED AT THE TAG ON THE INSIDE AND IT WAS INDEED A SIZE 12!!!!! VERY VERY UPSET.... TAGS MIXED MATCH.. I MEAN HOW COULD YOU PICK UP A SIZE FOUR AND PACKAGE IT, JUST THE APPEARANCE OF THE PANTS IT HUGE"
"Quality is less than what I expected. Slots for credit cards and ID are pretty small. It is necessarey to force cards into slots. Change purse has a snap instead of zipper. Change is constantly falling out. However, size of wallet is fine."
"I ordered this in a size 16 even though I only wear a 14 but this is still too small. Amazon should not let Korean company's sell attire on this site.  Asian sizes are very, very small compared to USA.  There are other sites they can sell on and if they continue to sell attire on Amazon, they need to make it very, very clear that these are Asian sized and run very small.  A size 14 Asian is probably a size 8 US.

I will make sure that I read where the item is coming from now that I've been screwed."
The underwire on one of the cups came out the first time I wore it. I took out the other underwire so they would be even. It looks cute but is poor quality. Dreamgirl as a brand is hit or miss. I like their thigh highs but this item was a miss. I would not recommend this.
short waisted so it dips really low in the back
"I was disappointed about the quality of this item. I have another bra by Bali (Passion For Comfort Minimizer Underwire) and it is very comfortable. This bra however was not. The side panels are cut too high therefore rub my armpit. The chest measurement is very tight. It does minimize as it states but ends up squashing the bust. The strap adjustment is in the front and even with it let all the way out it still is uncomfortable plus it rubs the skin and is uncomfortable. The thread that it is put together with is also scratchy like fishing line.
The Bali bra I like (Bali Passion For Comfort Minimizer Underwire Bra)is made in Honduras. This one is made in El Salvador. I don't know whether it is inconsistent quality control or whether this is just a random case."
"I had suspected something was up by the price and the fact that this is marketed as underwear. I was looking for a decent looking waffle-knit long sleeve thermal, what i got was definitely underwear. Think 2 sizes too small, a medium will suck tightly to your skin. That's fine for tight underwear but it is as scratchy as wattle-knit cardboard, it literally hurts to wear, there wasn't even a bottom hemline just a cut off seam."
It is a web belt but the buckle is cheaply made.
"It's beautiful, but if you have sensitive nose you will be bothered by its chemical odor."
Looks great but painful to walk almost feels like walking barefoot.
"I used to get these Fruit of the Loom (same style) socks in the regular size and they were affordable, they fit just a little small, but ""breathed"" well, and were soft and comfy.  As I needed a larger size, this time I got these.  However, the fit was no bigger!  Also, they say ""new -- with Lycra"" so maybe that's what makes them not ""breathe"" very well.  I wore them to go out shopping in my usual sneakers and my feet felt damp and uncomfortable.  Also, though they stretch nicely, they are too thin and rough feeling."
Poor quality fell apart after just a few uses...
these came in to tight
"i normally always buy skechers but am now going to look for something better quality. I've been wearing these shoes just for work. In the beginning they were very comfortable and seemed well built but 11 months later the stiching in the front all came off and the front of the shoe came almost off,don't buy these they are a waist of money,so sad because the shoes still look bran new."
Didn't like them. I don't see the difference so I rather wear more comfortable underwear.
They were extremely uncomfortable and did not like the fit or lack of support offered in this shoe.  I overpronate and this shoe is no good for my feet.
The bra was too small and I was disappointed to pay for return shipping.
u have to be an extremely fit woman to wear this.... otherwise.. do not try
"A little too wide for my neck. It's OK, not too bad. Shipment was on time."
worthless! way too small
"Dress was way undersized- the ""one-size medium"" is more like a childrens dress or a XS for adults. Cost twice as much as the dress to ship back to china for return so.. waste of money/time."
"I bought these because they are much cheaper than my preferred style, never again.  The strap placement seems to hit nerves and is most unpleasant with each step.  I've owned and enjoyed many, many pairs of Birks, but this is a poor design.  Even the soft footbed fails to redeem them in any way."
The Roxy logo started peeling off after 3 wears. so disappointed since it's such a cute suit.
Not good for girls with thin feet. Very wide shoe
Returned for being too narrow.  Have another pair in the same size bought at a Harley store and they fit great.
The handle wouldn't stay all the way up.
Thanks top
This dress is tiny. You have to order several sizes up.  It's meant to be form-fitting so I don't know how much to size up.  It is pretty good construction.
Too small. I need to return them.
It doesn't fit good at all
So small it hurts. And I know my size. This should have fit perfect. This dress is horrible. Dont buy it.
Ordered an XLG...but when i got it ....... it could fit an extra small petite .....
"These are attractive slippers, very comfortable, fit well and seem to be well made. But they radiant an extremely unpleasant odor! I don't know what these are made of, but they absolutely stink. Not just when put in front of your nose; they radiate out and fill an entire room with unpleasant odor. I have been driven crazy the past couple of weeks trying to track down an unpleasant odor in my house. I finally traced it to these slippers! Too bad because I really like them. But I can't stand having them anywhere near me because they smell so bad. Out to the trash they go and I'll shop for something different."
"Don't waist your money. They only last a week or so and then where the screws are, it starts cracking because it's plastic and eventually, you can't wear them anymore. I recommend metal, not plastic!"
"If you don't have a big butt, these pants are not for you. Definately not a slim fit. Very unsatisfactory."
This bra has no lift and no side support. Great if you're young and small.
"Style is nice, however, my wife went dancing the first night with these shoes, had had several nasty blisters to show for it the next day. Applying athletic tape the next time out, definitely helped."
"The shoes fitted well and comfortable when the pair was just received, but just after a couple of months the bottom of the right shoe deformed and curled up in the middle and started to hurt my foot. The most walking I had with the shoes was between the train station and my office, which is about 2 miles round trip, and I was just wearing it 2 or 3 days a week so I was very disappointed especially Adidas was not a bad name and so many people gave Samba such a high score."
This purse is already broken. The closure of the small change purse does not work anymore. Very disapointed. I appreciate receiving a replacement for this purse
Too small and there no invoice enclosed at time. Therefore no way to return product for a refund.
So disappointed. The waist on me wasn't a waist but an empire band under my breasts. Shapeless. I sent it back.
if your arms are like the average American then please note you will have to turn this into a tank top (which I did) its super cute and I love it but I'm not sure I like the fact that I have to have arms of a 10yr old to fit this.
after reading the reviews on how these pants fit or are a bit too big.. I am very disapointed.. they are very low waisted and are tight! i even ordered a size bigger just in case..
This would have bee very cute had it been at least twice as big.  Too Small!!!!
They were way to heavy.
I will be returning.  I just don't like them
I am upset with this product cause it is missing little jewel not only that the symbol in the big round matel is less deep so it appears differen and lookslike fake Alex and ani
"These leggings were small, small, small but for the price it is just easier to give them away. The company got the product here quickly but sadly. don't fit me."
"You get what you pay for. The seams started pulling apart after 1 use and the cool feature of it slipping over the suitcase handle, well that was tearing on the 5-6th use. We had to pin the seam together for our return trip home from France.  BTW our Rick Steves'  folding bag which can't slip over the suitcase handle and is more expensive had survived many, many trips domestic and abroad."
Design washes off very quickly
"I was hoping to like these T shirts.  They fit really well and look great.  Unfortunately, I bought 3 pairs and 3 of the 6 shirts started to tear within a week of wear.  5 stars for look and feel.  1 star for poor quality."
I liked the dress but the straps were too short and can't be adjusted so I had to return it. T
due to poor fit and being uncomfortable compared to similar products my wife threw these away after one wearing.  Looked nice though.
"A very large package of weather stripping costs less than four dollars at big box store and the material will hold up to  moisture much better. Plus, after you are done with sizing your hat, you will have 7/8 of the product left.
 This is one of those products that counts on people being lazy, gullible and can't think ""outside the box"". A complete waste of your money."
They are very cute. I ordered size 4 and they fit like a 2. Very disappointing
These pants run BIG. My husband has been a 34 waist for 10 years. I have to exchange them for a 33.
Sheds like crazy. My daughter can't wear it in the house because it leaves hair everywhere
No room for my girls. If your larger than a B I'd pass ever tho it's a beautiful dress
The zippers were very low quality and did not zip correctly. I returned these because the quality was lacking and they did not seem like they would held up well.
"I was disappointed with this boot. It was all ankle and no toe. Reality, looks like a female's boot. [ No offence to those who like the boot ]. I would suggest to go up at least half size, if not a full size. These are a narrow fit. The D is like a C. I am returning mine. Could be my taste! NOW FOR MY THOUGHTS OF AMAZON. Well! I can not fault Amazon. Their overall business model, is first class. The attitude of their staff is also first class. I will continue buying my foot wear from them."
"If you are going to make a complicated to use product, then you can at least write a good manual for it. As many other reviewers have noted, this product has a terrible instruction manual. It is out of order, jumps around, and makes little sense. I watched a video on youtube which was way better. If there were only 3 or 4 features of the watch, I could just figure it out. But this watch is feature rich, and therefore complicated. It is a mark of how little management cares about their customers. it wouldn't take much for somebody to write a decent instruction manual. With that said, mine also did not work. It never picked up my heart rate. I tried wetting the straps, licking the straps, fiddling with the battery and even hitting the reset button next to the battery (which was never mentioned in the instructions but by another Amazon reviewer!). Nothing worked. That is fine. Some things are defective and you replace them. I don't give bad reviews for that. But I will not get a new Timex because of how complicated it is to use, and the poor instructions."
"Seriously disappointed.  Thin, no structure, and even this darker color (brown) was see-through.  Almost as thin as pantyhose, and probably just as prone to snags."
This product has now damaged a couple of my sterling silver pieces of jewelry. I won't be reordering.
"True to size but strap rubs hard to the back, returning."
I was so disappointed in these shoes. The tops felt like plastic/cardboard and the inside was completely flat and hard. So not like the FRYE that I knew from the past. I had to send them back. I would not recommend these shoes to anyone.
"very hard to get on , i finally gave up. into the pile of usless stuff i buy on a whim."
"It's big and bulky. I'd be smacking people with it every time I turned around. The straps were uncomfortable and wouldn't stay up when I carried it. The concealed carry pocket was angled in such a way that light jostling would allow my weapon to fall out. So, $6 shipping and $10 to return. It cost $16 to just look at this thing. It looks cool, but I hated it in every other way."
"I purchased these aqua socks to use for a rafting trip.  Upon receiving the Aqua Socks and trying them on, my first impression was good quality and great value for the price.  However, about 30 minutes into my rafting trip, the sole's of each shoe separated from the shoes, due to what appeared to be the use of cheap glue - this made the shoes extremely uncomfortable to wear."
"bought these for my husband, but they were soooo small that I think they should really be labeled child sized. Didn't even fit on me"
"I purchased this in black, gray and burgundy. The black & gray are fine. The Burgundy bleeds terribly, the seller should have advised of this. The first day I wore it, it bleed on my white tank top and the cream sweater. I didn't realize that it was bleeding until I got up from my bed and it had bled onto my white sheets and cream blanket. Then I noticed that it bled on my sweater and tank top. My sweater is fine, soaked it immediately in hot water, but my white tank could not be saved. I have since soaked this in hot water with soap to let it bled out and then soaked it again in hot water and salt, because that could help stop the bleed. I do not know if this will help, we will see once it is dry. The only reason I am giving this 2 stars is because of the bleed, otherwise it is very warm and comfortable. I wore it out during negative degree weather and was good. One more thing, the fabric attracts lint and fuzz pretty easy from the 1st wear, so make sure to have a brush and a defuzzer to get it off."
"This watch is a replacement to the Seiko my wife got me 15 years ago when we got married.  That Seiko has worked flawlessly for the past 15 years so I wanted another Seiko.  Unfortunately it took some effort, two returns and three purchases, to get one that wasn't defective (or so I thought).

The first watch came with the bezel way off center and the screwdown ""B"" button wouldn't stay screwed down.  Returned that one and purchased a second.  Its bezel was only slightly off center and it seemed OK for about 20 minutes and then the glow pearl in the bezel fell out.  Returned that one and purchased a third.  This one seems to work fine so far (day two).  The bezel is about 99.99% centered and everything seems to the Seiko standard.

The interesting thing is the face of the second and third SSC017 look different that the picture.  The first one I received had the ""Seiko, Solar,
Chronograph, Divers 200m.""  The second and third have ""Seiko, X, Divers 200m"" where it was on the first, but it has ""Solar"" in the chronographs minute dial.  The X being the Prospex logo.

The watch is gorgeous with a nice solid feel.  The glow spots stay well illuminated for about 5 minutes and then they become very dull, but if it was pitch black you could tell the time for at least a half hour.  I have to say I love the look of this watch or I wouldn't have gone to all this trouble.

Something no one mentions is the Blue on the bezel is a deep dark royal blue, not the light cyan it looks like in many web images.

So and update...(1 week)....
I noticed the chronograph's second hand was continuously 1/5 to 2/5 off set after wearing it for a few minutes.  I kept resetting it back to 0, but it would keep migrating.  I watched it while tapping the watch against my hand and it jostles the chronograph's second hand out of alignment with very little effort.  Just wearing the watch was enough to have the hand drift loose.  I called Seiko to see if that was normal (perhaps it's on a mechanism that isn't locked when not in use and locks in when in use).  They said it should be locked in tight at all times when not in use so I needed to return it.  So now I've returned this 3rd watch and I won't be getting another of this model.

Seiko makes some amazing watches, but this one seems to be mass produced with no QC.  In three different watches, I experienced all the major problems everyone has described on the negative reviews: bezel being way off center, bezel jewel falling out, hands being loose.  I would not advise anyone to purchase this watch.

I'm going to stick with the well respected and historically bombproof Automatic.  I've purchased the Seiko SKX173."
"How can I described the shirt I RECEIVED. The shirt I received and the one in the picture are two different animals. The one in picture would be okay to wear to the office for casual wear. The one I received looked more like a large t-shirt. The colors were two different blues. The one I got I kept and will have to wear it with leggings and maybe boots in the winter or some type of casual heal in the summer. The t-shirt material is just not office wear and the cut is too relaxed to be dress up and too dress up to go to the grocery store... like I said hard to describe what this shirt is aiming to DO. I am keeping it because it is too much hassle to return the thing and I guess you can't go wrong with a basic tee, especially in blue."
weird fabric....stiff
"These seem to have a good strong clasp, but the size-adjusting clips have caused ugly snags on the webbing where they have been moved. That makes them unsuitable to wear with all but the MOST casual clothes."
"These get 2 stars for being super cute, but that's where the love ends.  I could not even get my foot in.  It kind of wedged in the spot where the boots turn 90 degrees from ankle to foot and got stuck.  I only wear a 9.5 shoe but I felt like a jack-knifed semi truck stuck in a small road.  I suspect my foot bones could be removed for easier access, but I chose to return these instead."
Increadibly small!! Be careful with sizing.
"Look good, but black ones broke within 2 weeks and other ones are crooked."
The only problem I have with the shoes is that the left shoe is really tight on my foot. I got a size 8 regular size and the right shoe fits great just not the left. I can't even really wear them because it's hard to walk in them when one fits weird.
"shipping was expected, but the color and shape are not like pictured.. Get what you pay for :/"
"I had to return it. I ordered a pink, and it was too thin and cheaply made- which is why it's priced cheaper than others. It is somewhat stretchy, but I suggest a darker color of you want to make it a mini dress. I'm 5 flat and 140 pounds and it all's mid thigh. It can be a mini dress for ladies my height."
"Product arrived scratched despite ordering one in a ""new"" condition. I returned it for a refund."
My product will not tighten. I had it in my shoe for 2 days and no difference. I tried to return but I have to pay postage and it cost almost as much as the products.
"The waist and leg sizes are mismatched. The waist is too small for a large size and the leg size is so large that it looks like a flared dress.
Not for me!"
"since 0 stars is not an option, I had to leave 1 star. no pros; only cons: 1) inaccurate size chart. 2) product is made of cheap material - like very thin spandex. 3) no free exchanges (terrible customer service). In order to try a different size, I'd have to pay $8 in return shipping and then buy the product again and cross my fingers that the next one will fit so I won't have to pay another $8 to return it. I'm not taking that chance. Because the product is so cheaply made, it's not worth it."
Did not fit  and I don't have time to return them
Hat arrived crushed. Couldn't be used. Donated it.
Wiill return
Bad chemical smell. I cannot believe this is safe for children.
I am a 32 full C and these bralettes as cute as they are did not cover much. I gave them to a friend who is a 32 small B and they fit her pretty well.
"The straps are far too long, and slide off of my shoulders even when tightened all the way."
This is poorly made product. It is not true to the size. Reviews don't match the reality! I returned it immediately.
Bad quality only the color is the same as the photo but otherwise looks like a pj nothing cute. Irregular sizing problem. Don't waste your money.
"My husband loves this watch, but it developed an issue within days.  The light gets stuck on.  Amazon sent me another one and the light doesn't work at all!  I want a refund, and will purchase elsewhere."
"Super heavy and uncomfortable. Sizing was messed up, and the rubber for the toe piece got bent in the mailing bag that amazon uses to ship causing further discomfort. Smells. Could use a little more design and color work."
"THESE UNDERWEAR ARE BY FAR THE WORST I EVER PURCHASED. THE MATERIAL IS LIKE A CHEAP T SHIRT. IT LOOSES SHAPE AS SOON AS YOU TRY THEM ON,NO SURPPORT  AT ALL.THESE  RIDE UP AS SOON AS YOU TRY TO PUT PANTS ON. THE GRION AREA IS EXTREMELY LONG. THESE MUST BE FACTORY REJECTS. NOW USING THEM AS CLEANING RAGS. SPEND EXTRA MONEY AND BUY THE REAL DEAL;"
I ordered an Large/Extra Large for myself and the hat barely fits the head of my 10 y/o daughter.  I just looked at the process to return it...  Cost practically more than the hat itself. Ugh...
came to me with some of the leather peeling off and within a month the leather holding one of the handles on broke off! I do not recommend this item
"It was a 32 waist, but once I opened it and tried it on, I noticed it was too big. There is no way I can use it unless I become chubby; too bad because I really like how the product looks."
"I like them, but they fit too large & don't stay up"
"Ran small, didn't stay up."
I bought this and the Three Seasons Women's Maternity in the same size. This top unfortunately was EXTREMELY small.
Chain broke on the first day
"Fit is slightly small, and the fabric is scratchy - even after several washings. I would not recommend."
I had selected these shorts because they were a little darker camouflage than other shorts I've seen. Turned out they were the lighter camouflage just like the other shorts. Very misleading unless you are wanting the lighter color.
I ordered a large even though I'm not that big. After washing the fit in the shoulders was tight and the sleeves were too short. I wouldn't buy another.
"cheap, what can I expect, fell apart as soon as I  put something heavy in it and not waterproof"
"This is just an odd thing.  It's two scarves held together with 4 buttons.  It doesn't lay right on my body, no matter which way I turn it, it's just weird.  Sending back."
"I have bought other Hanes boxer briefs in the past and was expecting these to be similar, but I was wrong.  The Hanes boxer briefs that I like have the name ""Hanes"" in red lettering while these have it in white/grey.  These, unlike the ones with the red lettering don't stay even a little tight against your thighs, they just give up after a couple hours and basically become boxers.  If I wanted to wear boxers I would have bought boxers.  I think other than that they are fine but I really don't like how ""loose"" they become by the middle of the day."
My tip has already come off and I just bought March 20th. This is ridiculous.
"These boots are cute and comfy, but fell apart in one week. :("
They ripped as soon as i put them on
Way too big ! And very difficult to open
"Im 6-2, 205. Bought a large and it was too tight in the shoulders. Bought an XL and it was too big in the gut. So now I have two shirts that don't fit. Ill get the XL taken in a bit but won't waste my time with another one of these."
legs way too baggy for boots or any other kind of shoes
"Great, but the quality is not as the price we paid for, and waited for over a month because sent from CHINA.  Please know this,  price based on made is USA, but it is Chinese product and Chinese time"
Didn't come out right
It was too small and was very thin. It isn't England's hair at all.
I really don't like this. I read in the reviews that it was thin but it worse than I imagined. Feels so flimsy. Definitely won't keep anyone mildly warm (last raincoat I bought was lined well inside and kept warmth in while keeping rain out) but let's hope it keeps off the rain. The color is nice and I like the two pockets at the front but that's it. I will see how long it lasts and what kind of rain coverage it gives and update my review
"Gave a 2 because, they are made smaller than regular pants.  But I think these pants are made very well and will hold up to alot of use."
"Vionic with Orthaheel Technology Women's Action...1st I bought size 6.5, but I found that size was too big. Too much room in the toe box and my heal was rubbing in the back from slipping.  They seemed comfortable, so I returned them for a size 6, which is really unusual for me to wear a size 6.  At first the size 6 fit perfect and seemed comfortable, but as I wore them longer in the house, they too began to slip on the heal and rub on the toes on my feet just like the size 6.5.  So, I am returning.  I need a good walking shoe that supports my foot without causing blisters.  I'm afraid these would not work on my exercise walk of 2.5 miles or more per day.  My normal shoe size to help others has always been a 6.5B. My Foot is 9.2. inches long and the widest part of my foot is 4 inches.  So, for me the Vonic with Orthaheel  Technology Women's Action run BIG!, if you have a foot similar to mine.  No I could not go down to a 5.5, the length would have been to short, the size 6 just fit with my big right at the end of the shoe with no room to be longer, other wise I might have tried a size 5.5.  These are not a very cute shoe either, but I needed them for exercise not style, if they had worked.  So, I am giving them only 2 stars, do not like them.  Oh they did support my arch, if they had worked, so maybe I should give them 3 stars.  Noop, only 2. . .Too much rubbing and slipping."
Ordered a size medium and looks like xlarge...is too short..
Too heavy and not as pretty when actually in hand.....returned for refund
"I didn't realize how tall the shoes would be. They hit me about four inches below the knee, and my legs are pretty skinny so the wide opening at the top just looked silly. And I couldn't get the laces to be tight enough to keep the top from rubbing back and forth when I walked. I'm in the process of returning them."
Very poor quality. Had a pair that I bought from rural king that didn't last but maybe 3 months. The back of the boot tore away from the sole. Called the company and they didn't do anything about it. Very day because Justin's were my favorite Bertrand until this happened. Sorry but that's what happens when we ship out jobs to Mexico. I'm done with Justin's now
"I am so disappointed in the fit of this top :-(.

I have bought several WearAll<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WearAll-Plus-Size-Women-s-Strappy-Swing-Vest-Top-Wine-US-16-18-UK-20-22/dp/B00JMHS9ZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WearAll Plus Size Women's Strappy Swing Vest Top - Wine - US 16-18 (UK 20-22)</a>&nbsp;Swing Tops in UK 20-22. I figured since I was dealing with the same Brand/Vender the sizes would run the same. WRONG!!

The material felt nice, the length would be great with leggings or jeans BUT IT WAS UNCOMFORTABLE! The neck opening is very sung, but the real problems are the armhole openings and the tightness of the sleeves! The arm hole is so small, it bunches badly. I wasn't even sure I would get my arms into the sleeves. Once I did get the sleeves on, there was NO extra give to re-position the sleeve or pull it up some.

Since this ships from England, returning it is out of the question. I will pass this along to my teenage grand daughter."
just bad .
It was very light in weight
"While the idea might have seemed good, this nail polish is awful.  The polish that you see in the pictures is not exactly what you will get.  First of all, it looks like it is loaded with sparkles and little black shapes that look kind of like a letter U.  I was eager to see the effect that all of that would have.  Well, the first time that I used it, it looked like clear nail polish with sparse tiny glitter flecks.  I applied two more coats and only got two of the black pieces on my nails.  I have no idea how this is supposed to work, when there isn't much glitter and the black pieces are really hard to get out.  After all of that, the black pieces did not lay flat and easily came off.  They don't always lay flat and the texture is irritating.  I tried several times to use this.  I still had issues with the black ones, even when there is one on the brush, it is hard to get it to lay on the nail right.  This was after I used a third of it.  I am not sure how others got this to work for them, but it was a mess to me.  I am not giving this polish one star because the polish itself is pretty good it dries quickly and lasts.  Basically if you want to try this brand, don't get this color and you will probably be pleased."
"The dress was way too big when it arrived. I tried to return to seller, but could not because it is located somewhere in China. Beware when ordering."
Don't expect to be impressed with this suit.  It is very cheap and hard to function in while wearing.  You could never walk around collecting candy with it.  The mask is very cheap rubber that causes your face to sweat quite a bit.  And the feet are kinda like walking around with scuba flippers on.  It looks really cool in the picture but it's not very practical to own.
Junk junk . I do love Betsy would buy almost anything Betsy but it's is strictly garbage
I ordered a 2x to get an average fit and it fits like a large. Very disappointing.
No elastic at the tongue or the heal.  Foot will not go in the opening of the shoe.  Probably would fit if you can get your foot through the opening without destroying the shoe.
"They are cute, but very stiff and uncomfortable.  Shoes returned."
It fell apart and had a mildew order to it.  =(
Very cute jacket but the sizing is off.
"Obviously fake suede spats.  These are made of a thin material that wraps around the leg, and is closed with Velcro.  I am going to add more Velcro so I can make them fit more snugly around my leg.  The ends are merely cut and not hemmed.  They look all right from a distance, but fake up close."
My ring doesn't look like this picture at all the stones look almost clear there are maybe three stone that are the March aquamarine but the rest look clear.
"I've been wearing the Gel Nimbus 15 for a few years.  It has great cushion and good control, and was the perfect shoe to help manage my plantar fasciitis.  This shoe has nothing in common with the 15.  It has very little cushion, and the toe box is very narrow & constrained.  Other reviewers mentioned this, so I bought up-size and up-width - to no avail.  Normally, I wear a size 9, medium.  I bought a 10 EE.  The length is ok, but the toe area is still tight and constricted.  These big shoe companies must employ experts whose only job is to ruin good models."
Bought the small and it fits like a large.
Not exactly as the picture potrayed. The carbon fiber was covered with a thick layer of epoxy plastic that you could barely see the detail. The thickness was closer to a 6-7mm. Overall it looked too much like costume jewelry and I returned it.
Was were the designers thinking? The 'pretty' floral imprint on the footbed HURTS!!! I cannot stand on it for more than a few seconds before I feel pain. I will say I do have sensitive feet and cannot tolerate walking barefoot on concrete/asphalt/gravel or other rough surfaces.
Material way to thin. I returned them
"Im a carhartt fan. And I actually LIKE the Carhartt Men's Ripstop Cargo Work Pant Flannel lined. The pants are nice ,The cargo pockets fit my needs.
BUT the Flannel lining is a JOKE No way will they do you any good in the winter months,Just to thin,The Carhartt t shirts are thicker than the flannel  JThey are made maybe for a chilly ,early fall day But thats about it. They will get returned"
"I bought these for my baby when she was about 5 months old.  She never had a problem wearing sunglasses, but the frame part of these is so stiff that unless it fits your kid perfectly, it's quite uncomfortable.  I also think that the band is more harmful than helpful, and it doesn't allow for comfortable adjustment behind the ears.  I would recommend finding a more traditional behind the ears pair of glasses with flexible plastic frames."
"Very stiff! Yes, Vivos that are super stiff."
"Buyer Beware, this is junk! The stone is not real as stated and it has a plastic cord attached, something you would get in a 25 cent machine!"
Scratchey and awful :( very upset
These shorts are so flimsy !! No made well
"The boots I received had a huge flaw-the sole was separating from the boot.  Had to send them back.  I would expect better quality from Woolrich.  Too bad, because they are super cute boots.  Woolrich better step up their quality control."
"The shoes are fantastic......however, my daughter 11 yrs old, the person to whom the footwear was for CANNOT fit one pair. My niece who wears a size 2-3 is wearing them. I am assuming I need a ladies size 7 if my daughter, of 11 yrs old, is going to wear a pair. I was very disappointed and she was in tears. So, my review is bittersweet. These shoes are cut really small.

If possible I will try to utilize the provided coupon, and get her some DAWGS, a few sizes larger. Thank you for the coupon."
Arrived with a tear on the upper thigh. Not worth th time and effort to return. Will head out to my local dance store instead.
Poor quality - I returned
"Not cut as shown. It is a non-stretch fabric with no zipper. There is absolutely no one could put this item on and have it look like it does in the photos. If it fits over your head/shoulders, then it would be super loose under the bust. If it was fitted under the bust then there is no way it could have gotten on without a zipper. The photos must have clamps tightening the sides not shown in the photo."
Shirt is very small.. Ordered a size 6 and it's more like a 3t.. It's soft and cute but order a few sizes up
Not what I expected. The sleeves run very small
Lovely purse however I ordered the red and black not the pink and black
"My foots a little wide so they fit a little tight in width but they should stretch to fit really well.

Update:
After wearing for a week at work I am not a fan.  I have to wear steel toe boots outside my office but to keep it clean inside I wear slip-ons in the office.  The right shoe has not stretched at all and causes my foot to go to sleep.  I am wearing them with the insole out to gain a little room so my foot will stay awake.  The length is good but over the top of my arch is way to tight."
It didn't fit my face very well and it was quite flimsy. On another note it was pretty and it worked for my needs.
I have Charcot Marie Tooth and these shoes hurt my feet terribly.  My bottoms of my feet became inflamed...red red red after just an hour of wear.  So disappointed.
Didn't like fit. It kept rising over bra when I raised my arms.
"Really nice jacket. Slightly heavy, but does a great job keeping you warm. Normally I don't care much for brand names and this was the first Michael Kors product that I purchased. Really happy that I snagged it at a discount during Amazon's thanksgiving sale.

** UPDATE **
So I have only worn this occasionally, and recently I noticed that a section of the inside lining is torn. Not exactly sure if it was shipped to me that way because I did not inspect it closely. Regardless, the jacket has only had very light use during the winter and no reason for the lining to start coming off. If you decide to buy the jacket, I recommend inspecting every stitch inside and out."
unless you are a VERY SMALL CALF/LEG woman they won't fit
You can see right thru it
"I returned this immediately. The shirt was packed in a disheveled manner, top 3 buttons not closed, and it smelled like something washed in a heavy fragranced laundry soap or fabric softener."
"The shoe was very cute. The color was true to shown, but the fit was tight in the toes. It would get a 5 for cute, but not sure I like my toes becoming one. They were returned."
Thick- but fairly small. Then they stretched out too much...
These boots didn't even make it a month before they got a hole in the toe area at the seem
"The shoes are too small, I wear a womens size 10 and these are not 10s, maybe a 9 or 9.5 but definitely not a 10."
Cute but does not give you shape at all!
These were Returned as they fit like a 36 waist! Also they are a very stiff material they are made of.
This style fits roughly a size to large in both the waist and inseam.  Frustrating that there is such inconsistency in the Levi's Brand.
These are not leather. They are made of man made materials. Also they are about a half size larger than my canvas converse.
"Save your money...comes from china. Horrible material, no support and looks funny on. They never gave me a refund either!!!!!"
"not as expected, had to return"
"The image is not as big on the tee as the depict it to be  Kinda bummed about that. My daughter is still gonna wear it, but she wasn't happy cause the tiger was ""too small"""
These are made for a small oriental foot and not a American mans foot.
returned merchandise because the size & color was not right fit.
"Lacking in support for any kind of lift.  I would never buy another, but I should have known - I'm definitely an underwire person."
"I was not a fan of this dress at all. The fit wasn't right and it was kind of sheer. It felt like a cheap blanket material and came in super wrinkly. Put it back in the bag and shipping it off. I understand it's a cheaper dress but I have bought 15 dollar dresses at better quality than this. I was very disappointed. It looks MUCH nicer in the picture. I really don't like clothes that are remotely see through and I could see my bra through this, not happy."
I would give this ring five stars except for the fact that the girl I gave it to turned out to be a cheating whore.
"Th fit was good but the placket in the front was not centured. If it was anything but a nightgown, i would have sent it back"
Temberland cut corners on this shoe. Not of the quality I would expect from Timberland. Would not purchase again.
This is made for  lean skinny babies and not for babies with chubby arms.
Shrunk in first wash and larger than normal
So weird.
"This blouse is not as cute in person, and the material is easy to wrinkle."
THIN TINY AND UNCOMFORTABLE
These were the worst ever. Both of them broke in little more than two weeks. Waste of money.
I wish the cover was an attached lid. It does show off my rings to delight anyone's eyes and holds the rings securely in place.
"I returned these. I normally buy Levi's directly from their store, and will do so in the future. I have this exact style and size and they fit great, so I thought I was safe ordering online. Wrong! These were significantly tighter at the waist, had low quality stitching, and cheap label on the back.  don't know if it was a knockoff or just a lower-tier run. Levi's swears they have the same quality jeans for their various outlets, but these were not at all the same."
Would give zero if I could not real ugg boots but a pretty good knock off. Gave as a gift without thinking to check security features only to later find out they're not authentic.
"the Dress fit but the Belt was a little to big and couldn't close it, the loop was to small to fit the Belt through. also the Dress was very wrinkled so I wouldn't put it a suitcase for Travel. I returned the Dress"
"Product quality is gooood. but It's larger than I expected. and color is light black or grey as far as i think.  I'm 5""9"" 156 lb.
176cm / 70. so big. big .big. If I knew that, I was gonna order Small."
"I love the Levi's 569 shorts. I have worn them for almost 10 years now. This was my first time buying them from Jimmy Jazz Inc. I ordered two pairs and both felt almost like cardboard. Imagine taking a shirt to the dry cleaner and hey use 10 times the amount of starch......thats what these shorts felt like. I just bought 2 pairs on sale from JCP and they are very soft like all the other 569 shorts I have bought. They were more expensive than the ones from Amazon, but they feel like the real thing."
"Stylish looking, and my 28 year old son was thrilled with the gift, but the side rubber cracked and began to peel after a month, and 2 weeks ago the toe piece entirely broke, so they are in the garbage now. Not what I would expect from this brand, for this price"
"I recived watch , not working .... Used"
"Not only was the large gigantic, but it came in a different, absolutely see-through fabric (I ordered other sizes at the same time, they were a non see-through fabric).  Not sure why only the large was wrong, but beware"
I ordered the same jeans as I bought in the store just a different color. But this one is about 1 inch smaller
"I am not sure if this watch is running today.  It did for a while yesterday but then, like a poorly made piece of armor, seemed to fall apart.  I keep staring at it wondering if I have grown to wear watches as if they're just bracelets...I think so."
Stiff cheap leather. Print very muted. Too big. Thought it would be ok size after reading reviews. My fault. Returned.
"Too boxy round the middle.  I feel like I'm wearing a tent.  Also, had trouble with the button holes with the threads catching on the button.  Not a fan.  I'll have a seamstress or tailor fit this to my shape a little better, but that's going to be additional expense I'd rather not have.  I'd return the shirt for a refund, but my wife threw out the packaging materials..."
They are too heavy for small feet. Hate them I got better ones in jc penny light weight and comfortable.
the fit  around my ankles was too wide.  I returned them.
"This brief rides too low for me, doesn't ride along the waist line but just below it.  Hugs the package too tightly and is not as flexible as other sport boxer briefs."
"The Pros on Item: Nice color, flattering v neck cut. The Cons on item: Item is JUNIOR SIZING so order this shirt as if you were getting an item that has a junior fit. Best for bodies that are thin or no body issues at all. Otherwise order up by 1-2 sizes from size you would normally get. I am a size XL-XXL in junior sizes and I should have gotten at least an XL in this shirt had I know this. I am a ladies size 10-12 and I am 5.6 inches tall. Shirt does not fit to flatter curves if it is too small. Also, FYI, the return policy is not great if you choose to return and this does not fit you well at all. The shipping fee is $5 deducted from your total paid to the company for merchandise, plus there is an additional 20% restocking fee. I ordered 2 shirts with a total of a little over $12 and some odd cents, by the time it is all said and done, I will get back in return funds the equivalent of 1 cup of Starbucks coffee!
This is not the company's fault really, my own fault as I should have looked at the return policy and I probably would have paid a few more $ for an Amazon Prime item and had the hassle free returns that Amazon is known for! Mainly my mistake here for thinking this would be a good buy, not really, but you live and learn."
This New Balance is too wide.
"Overall the jean was nice, but I had to send back. I had order a 30 length, got short legs, it was actually 34 in length. Even the label inside said 30 on the length. Ended up returning, didn't risk exchanging for you only get one first impression."
"first off, the sleeves don't look anything like they do in the picture, in person they look ridiculous. Second, the front cut goes way too low you can't wear a bra or a sticky bra with it. Third I weight 115 pounds and I'm 5'3 and this makes me look pregnant... It's terrible quality I will be returning this."
"I bought five of these tanks in different colors, and not any two are the same.  The fabric on one is medium weight and nice looking, but the hem is cheaply done.  The white chiffon is totally see through and the neck is too high.  The other three are very light weight, and all are big through the ribcage and tummy area.  They are not consistent at all, and all were made in the U.S, so I thought they would be a lot better quality.  I know they are not expensive, but they are only tanks.  I will probably send them back."
"Handle Broke, the body scratched and scuffed within a few days"
Yuk!! Looked like I was wearing an old apron in front and back
Shoe is too narrow.
shoe advertised as being 10.5 wide - not even  close!
i ordered two sizes in these jeans and both were to small. .
These are so cute but came with huge hole where panels should be Im very disappointed
Junk. Do not order or pay this kind of money for this item. It took forever to get here.
"The material is light and airy.  The elastic part fits perfect however, the bra part was too big."
"I bought a second pair for myself, since I never recieved them it's hard to say, except, my daughters are warm.  She loves them"
"I can't lift my arms.
I'm 5'3"". 120 lbs and I feel like singing Tommy Boys, fat guy in a little coat, every time I put it on. Which has been twice.  It's not wearable.
It's also really cheaply made.  Embarrassingly cheap."
color is different from the picture~and even Stains on shoes
"I was quite disappointed because this dress fit very well, but was about 4 inches too short. I'm fairly tall (5'10"") so this wasn't unexpected but was certainly disappointing. The biggest reason it only gets two stars was the fabric. Extremely thin and see through. I would not be comfortable wearing this under a bright light of any kind."
"This shoe is very flimsy, more like a cheap flip-flop.  I have had other Columbia Sandals and they have definitely started to make a poor quality shoe for women now.  The men's models have decent soles, much better quality but they are too wide for women's feet.  Too bad they have cheapened their products! I returned them and wouldn't recommend them or buy them again."
Opal fell out the day I got it and the clicker was broke. It's very pretty but I'm glad it was not expensive.
"First of all, I can't believe how many five star reviews there are for this watch, and that's really part of the reason why I ended up buying one, so don't make the same mistake I did. I think if you read through the reviews you'll notice that most of the five star reviewers don't say how the watch held up, and are basing their review completely on their first reaction to the watch.

This is not a great of a watch. It's basically just your run of the mill made in china buy at Walmart watch, with a shiny outer shell. I'll admit that it does look cool in the pictures, but honestly when I received mine I was a bit disappointed. The little metal pieces on the clock face look completely silver, not black like in the images, and after only about three months of normal wear, one of those pieces came off of mine.

Not only that, but I took this watch with me when I went to Guam, and just being in the humid climate caused humidity to build up inside of the watch face. Seriously, this watch is not good enough for what it costs. If you open up the back and look at the mechanism you can even see that it is identical to a Walmart watch.

If you're going to spend this much money on a watch get something else. There are lots of great watch brands that will charge you much less and work a lot better. Cheers!"
"Don't buy if you are over 5'4"" I'm 5'6"" 130lbs and it doesn't fit, its length is for a shorter person"
Painfully tight in the width direction compared to other shoes of the same brand and size (12 EE). The issue seems to be that the strip of fabric connecting the tongue to the body of the shoe to make them waterproof won't let me loosen them enough across the balls of the foot regardless of the laces. I suspect they saved money by making the strip narrow. Other than being unwearable due to a massive design flaw they seem to be manufactured well. If you have narrower feet than mine they would probably be great.
"wide is way too small, straps too tight...others have said the same thing.  Usually this brand fits well and i don't need an extra wide, but in these I would.  Must be why these are still around and on sale.  Now the next size up is sold out so i'm out of luck."
WORST PURCHASE EVER! Cheap material and the rings which are sowed with a little cheap ribbon break easily. You can pull them yourself. Waist of money.
"I ordered an XL, I wear a L. The sweater came too small. If I were to wash it, it would shrink to a M. Not a fan."
"I like it but doubt I can wear it.  It runs long, the bottom fits but the top is way too loose."
"I ordered the brown ones. These are beautiful and the quality is excellent. Sadly I got two very mismatched feathers, which is a pretty big deal. One was a brown exactly like the photo, rich and pretty. The other was purple (-2). Also, the accent feathers were not blue as pictured. They were green (-1).
Will update re: cust service."
"It had an awkward fit. I am only 5'4"" tall and the item was ordered according to the sizing chart but it was too short to be a swimsuit cover-up. Pretty, but I returned it."
There is zero lining on this. That picture is deceiving. The fabric is thin enough to reveal the slightest breeze on th e smallest woman.
Way too small and cheap material.
It was good. After first washing the Forum did not stand up well.
The tag that is sawn into the seam of this belly band itched me so much that I never use it. I can't cut it out because it would either destroy the seam of the side of this band or make the tag itch even more. Not impressed.
"We received this item in exchange for an honest review.  I ordered my typical size for fitted shirt 18x36 and this was far too tight.  I would say that slim fit is very accurate and if you are indeed slim this might work well for you... I normally wear an athletic fit and this was too tight to even fully button up all the way.  Again, if you are buying for a slim fellow the quality of the shirt seemed nice, just didn't work for me."
I did not like this scarf at all. It's much too long for me. I gave it away to someone taller than I am.
"Flimsy, pink is a dirty, dusty rose."
This bra is made from very poor material. It is uncomfortable and feels like you are wearing plastic.
"The quality of these shoes is not the best. No arch support, no padding...just cheap ballet flats."
"THESE HURT!  They are super cute, but I wore them to work and only made it a quarter of the way through a full 8 hour shift before I had to take them off and walk through my class in socks."
The headpiece was NOT included! What a ripoff!
"This hoodie was a total disappointment. I thought I had done a better job of interpreting the fabric description. The fabric of the garment proved to be a cheap, nearly translucent material that was so light as to be of no use to wear even as a ""layer."" Rather than returning it, I gave it away, hopefully someone else will find it suitable. This cheap flimsy hoodie was not for me."
"I don't know how to describe these except rugged, they're comfortable and look nice in the photo, usually I even like chunky shoes.  However, these were more than chunky.  I was using the word harsh to describe them, but I think that rugged is a better word.  With the leather, straps, buckle, and cork, they seem like they'd be cute.  They're just not in person, not cute and they're not made well enough to be ""rugged"" - I wouldn't want to go hiking in them!"
"I really wanted to like these, as they felt great on when I first wore them. I have had trouble finding pantyhose that are comfortable to wear, but these have a very comfortable waistband and the price is moderate as well. The pantyhose also look very nice with the lace top. However, after using them a few times, I noticed that the fabric started to wear, especially under the heels but also on visible areas (on top of the foot etc.). If you look at the picture I posted, you can see that there's clear pilling, and this is after only perhaps 5 uses! It's unfortunate, as I realize that it won't take long until there will be so much pilling that I really can't wear them anymore. I got these in both grey and black and while the pilling is more visible on the grey version, I can also see it on the black pantyhose.

This is perhaps my own fault, as I didn't really look at the washing instructions, but I washed these pantyhose by hand and used water that probably was too hot. I believe the hot water caused the silicone strip on the waistband to partially come off (see the picture). So I guess you really should make sure that you don't wash these in hot water either, because that might ruin the waistband."
"If you want something cheap to give away, it will not last"
"Not up to the usual standards of Clarks. Very flimsy, not supportive at all. I am sure I would be twisting my ankle before long. Sadly, had to return them. Clarks previously had their Artisan series, which were absolutely 10 star. Too bad they no longer make them."
The pictures are deceiving!  These mannequins must have no neck or are half the size of a human.  This product will not even touch your shoulders let alone cover them.  Don't waste your money.
"Just don't waste your money. I never write reviews like this but I don't want to see anybody else stuck with 6 bras that are useless. I ordered a 36 D. Figured hey its not a bad price and I don't have to go shop around to find cute colors. The shape of the cup is not flattering. The straps are thin and flimsy. The worst part is when you hook it around yourself... there's hardly any support. The elastic doesn't feel like it's even there. Today I wanted to give the benefit of the doubt and wear it all day. I kept thinking maybe it's just something I can get used to.. yeah no. There's a hole on the back near the hooks where the edge separated from the fabric piece. I wore the thing one day. I sat at a computer desk all day, how the heck did it have a hole already?  Unfortunate for me I detagged two of them so I can't sent them back."
Its seems like this is not original!!! Beware
"Will be returning. I'm 5'4'', 140 lbs and these barely go over my knee. I wanted thigh highs, more like the advertised picture. The material is not very stretchy or soft, making them very uncomfortable. The colors are also off."
"Waste of money, the wig is Barbie hair like, and much shorter than on the pic. I didn't even for my 8 year old daughter."
The color is misleading and the wool inside looks old. Not my style after all..
"Lovely band, rose gold is very nice however the stone was orange. I sent it back. The seller was very prompt with my refund."
I ordered a size and a half up and they were still too small. They took FOREVER just to try on and they squeak like the boots SpongeBob had
"After two weeks of use sole come unstuck!!! Teva, is it really your PREMIUM product????"
"I loved the look of this bra.  I am a large bust at 40 G so I get excited when I see pretty bras in my size.  While pretty, this bra is way to small.  If bras end up being slightly smaller usually I can pull them off.  But the cup size.  Oh my.  The girls were not contained!  My cups overflowed.  Like flooding overflowing.  The band was perfect.  It is just the dang cup size."
"Very cheaply made, fits the price I paid! I already have holes in the soles of the shoes after only wearing them two times."
Front pocket tore at the seam after a month. Not the quality I expect from carhartt. Color quality and comfort is good though. Hopefully I got a lemon.  Stitching  quality at the front pocket very poor
This was way too small it would've fit my one-year-old daughter
There is ink stain on the collar. No sense in sending it back. Too much trouble. They won't let me post a pic. I tried 3 times. I won't re-buy this shirt.
not good dress extremely small . it think these dresses are mainly made for Asian  women who are super tinny and skinny
These shoes were labeled wrong. There was no way they were a size 9. Maybe a size 7.5 or 8. Could not even get foot in them.....impossible....So pay shipping back. Not happy. Would not buy from this seller again. Love the style. Ordered the right size and got burned.
these tank tops are paper thin.  You have to wear something underneath because you can see right through them. won't get again
"Like many others here have said, this runs a bit small.  I'm a 34dd and can squeeze the girls in, but it doesn't necessarily feel the greatest.  If you're at all big chested this probably is not for you.  I'm just glad I paid less than $5."
stitching coming out within one week. cheap quality.
"Ordered Large, according to chart. 35.5"" waist. 5'8"", long torso, 190lbs, wear size 12.
Wouldn't come CLOSE to fitting. So, do I exchange for XL or XXL?
Last  year, I was a bit smaller (32"" waist) and ordered a small, according to the chart. It didn't seem much different than the Large.
I still have it, since I'm hoping to get to wear it. So I laid them out flat to see... If the hook ends are lined up, the Large is about an INCH longer than the Small. I attached pics.
If I can get one that FITS, I'll change the rating."
"Too small, and the material is scratchy.  However, I like the style, and decided to keep them all."
turned green after first week
I normally wear a large but ordered the extra large and it was way too small in the chest area
"I am 5'4 and 100lbs. I ordered a small and the top was more for a C cup not an A, and they bottoms were way too small."
Cheaaaaapppppp
The boots are nice but I was in pain only after a couple of hours. It left me with a bruise on my foot from the zipper near the ankle pressing against my foot. I will not wear these again nor can I due to the pain and bruising.
"Squeak, squeak, squeak when you walk. Wife couldn't stand it and threw them away."
corset did not look anything like the one advertised was totally different.
Would not buy again. Very thin. Washed it once and I'll probably never wear it again.
"Great color, nice fabric and stretchy. My complaint is that the bottom is not flared very much so it sticks to your body. The cut is wrong and does not flow like in the picture. I ordered a size larger than I normally wear too."
"Shoes looked good, but were the most uncomfortable shoe ever.  They didn't feel as though they were a right and left foot but both somewhere in between.  No padding on the insole.  Awful shoes.  Sent them back the day I received them.  They were cheap and it showed."
"One LARGE watch!! I'm not sure how I feel about it just yet...I purchased it at a great price, as an extra for my 17 yr old son for Christmas.  .  I like the look of a large watch, but this may be over doing it.  I'll update this review after Christmas.

Update.....husband came home from work, and I had him try it on.  He's 6 ft tall, maybe 200 lbs., and has what I consider average to average/large wrists, and this watch was large even on him.  I've educated myself somewhat as to understanding case size, as listed in the watch descriptions, so I will not make this mistake again.  Returning the watch in the morning. A 48mm size case is HUGE."
Way too small. The sizing is off. I ordered a size 40 which should be a USA  9 but the shoe said 6.5. Also there was no blue on the shoe they were all black so buyer beware you won't get what is pictured. The shoes aside from being too small were very stiff feeling also.
This hat is way too poofy for a ball cap.  I could probably hide my car keys and wallet between the hat and my head!
"too small. the material is very 'heavy' for a sandal. Would not recommend it to anyone.  wanted to return but as my other reviews say: I cannot return due to Amazon says ""return window has closed"". Being disabled with Lyme disease, I'm in/out of hospital alot, so i am not always home to return within 'store/Amazon' guidelines! Online is the only way i can shop---so very disappointed in amazon for not being more flexible for certain circumstances....."
"Runs sooooo small. Arms are really tight, very cute dress but it's definitely made for thin girls"
"This is not leather.  very por quality.  Won't recomend to anyone.  Looks good at the beggining,  looks terrible after 4 weeks."
"This is the worst product i ever ordered and that to paid extra 12 bucks for shipping .
Quality is cheap to the maximum and at the same time the size is another problem. And for return its customer responsibility to pay for the shipping charge."
"I paid for  expedited shipping and the item did arrive in a very speedy manner BUT I ordered a Medium, but received size SMALL pants and Medium everything else. Really no time to get anything else sent here. The material is very lightweight, so much so that I am afraid of it ripping when it is worn, even more afraid what will happen if it  washed. THe picture seems to be a much better quality material than what was received.
DEfinitely not custom in any way shape or form."
I ordered the wide and it was not a good fit for me. Had to return them. Like Reebok products though.
"Hi, I bought this watch because it was sapphire crystal antireflective, this means that the glass does not scratch, but a lie, a few days ago I moved my hand near an aluminum table and I accidentally hit the clock in corner and the glass was scratched."
The fabric is very ugly . It's not the same the picture
"When i received the watch it was in working order, perfectly fine. set the time and date with a little bit of difficulty due to the buttons being hard to press and get a response from the watch. (not to mention the size of the band being way too big. Nothing a watch wizard cant fix)Though eventually after rearranging the instructions on the manual to the correct order. I set the time. BUT long behold the problems didn't end there. 30min after i set the correct time I noticed the watch had fallen 10 minutes behind the current time. and progressively lost time at that rate. Didn't bother me much as it was still interesting to look at, but of course. Button A just stopped working. and without it of course, you cant set the time. Immediately went back onto amazon and requested return, and it was picked up the very next day. Overall I had a bad experience with this watch. much a like a few other people. If you've got a lot of luck, maybe you'll get the magic one that works and doesn't break 3 hours after it arrived. Buy at your own risk. Other than the problems I had it was a very stylish watch, Bright LED's and a solid stainless steel band making it heavy and durable. Just need to be lucky and get one that works correctly.

Got my money back for this one and bought myself a brand new COMPLETELY Non-electrical analog watch. Just not ready for the future of watches quite yet."
Thhe color faded off very fast and it was not worn in water. Also when it csme there was red in the yellow portion like it was smeared and not fixed
I was horrified today when I received my package. I did not try it on. I received what appears to be a sealed plastic clothing bag. I rip it open and the first thing I see is a blond strand of hair (my hair is black) on top of the fabric. I thought well okay maybe just a stray happened to get into the package. I proceed to take the item out of the bag and notice several other hairs. I am taken aback only to further realise after pulling out three strands that the ENTIRE CARDIGAN IS COVERED WITH STRANDS OF BLOND HAIR. To make matters worse I look at the tag that would go behind your neck when you wear it and there are two spots on the white tag (obviously a STAIN of some kind). IT APPEARS WORN AND RETURNED BY A CUSTOMER. This item is SOLD AND SHIPPED BY AMAZON and I am so disappointed right now that I may just throw it away. I don't know who wore it and why all that hair? It is human hair for sure. I wasted my money and it is not logical to return since it would cost more to return than the item itself. If I could give zero stars I would. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. I decided to post this comment because I wanted others to be aware before they purchase. I will post the pics to show what I mean in an update to my comment. AMAZON I WANT MY MONEY BACK FOR THIS TRASH!
"Soft outside, rough inside.  Not what I want my baby feeling.  It's too hot to use as a costume for parties/occasions so it's now only for trips to the mountains/snow when she has something else on underneath so she doesn't feel the abrasion of the inner material."
"Do not buy, all stones fell off within a week, not worth the hassle to send back. Other rings from this company did the same thing. Buy elsewhere"
Too small on the sides if your kid has wide feet
They were really box-y. We returned both of them.
S*** was misspelled Everywhere and I ordered a large and it didn't fit my 31inch waist
No lining...cheap material...bought one with linen from Costco for $20 ...
Strange fit. Not at all like the original shoe
It's too big for my wrist and there's no adjustment capabilities at the back of the watch.
Maybe it is a original Polo Ralph Lauren but the quality of the Tshirt is very pour. The fabric is too thin
way way too big and baggy
"My husband gets a new pair of slippers at Christmas and they generally last him an entire year. He wanted a second pair, so I bought these. They fell apart after about three months."
I like them but the softness and coloring faded horribly with first hand wash and dry. Burgundy turned almost pink.
The fit was a strange- despite being stretchy it made my waist look boxier-- and the material it's made up is scratchy and squeaky. Kind of feels like woven plastic. I returned this product.
"Really flimsy construction.  I mean, REALLY flimsy.  For a purse/bag with this much volume, the materials and construction need to be up to the task. In the picture, these bags must be stuffed only with cotton or wadded up paper, because there is no way you'd be able to fill this bag.  I didn't anywhere NEAR fill it... I was carrying a wallet, a cellphone, a mobile phone charger, a pair of sunglasses, a coin purse, a comb, and my house keys.  That's ALL, barely enough to cover the bottom of the bag..  And after about a week and a half, the seam holding the bottom of the purse on started to unravel at the stitch line, leaving holes in the bottom of the bag."
"I had a ""traditional"" style watch that I needed this product for. Very impressed the first day, no noise, cool blue LED. On the second day it stopped. The LED light would come on for about 15 sec and the winder stopped."
not what i was expecting
"I am so disappointed in these Donald Pliners. They are made very cheaply and there is no particular interesting aspect about them. The lug soles are great and they are very light. However, the inside of the left boot has glue on it which is a product of sloppy workmanship. Also, they are very plain with no zip or point of interest to make them special. Donald Pliner has officially gone to China and I will be returning these boots."
Proportions are off. Not enough rise. The Danskins fit much better.
"These appear to be good shoes but I have a hard to fit foot, very wide with a high instep and these just didn't work.  When I say 'too narrow', 'too small' that's just for me.  These look very comfortable otherwise."
"The top is terrible, no structure what so ever."
Not true to size. Need to return
"So the shirt itself is a perfect fit, just as expected. But as a huge comic book nerd and major fan of the Punisher, the logo was extremely disappointing. It advertises it as taking up most of the shirt with the top of the skull covering your whole just and the teeth going down to the waistline. In actuality, though, the bottom of the teeth don't reach my belly button and the width of the logo is smaller than my own face. The shirt is fine, the graphic is not."
"This shoe looked good, but unfortunately my Orthic did not fit , so returned them"
"The minute I put these on I knew they wouldn't work for me.  I love Skechers in general but not the automatic lace ones.  One cannot adjust the laces and there are not real holes in the shoes so that one could put in a different pair of laces that tie.  the automatic laces are not tight enough for me and the shoes slip off my feet.  Also, my feet are slightly different in size (as are most people's feet) and I need to tie them differentially, not count on a shoe to automatically adjust to my individual foot and these shoe laces do not automatically adjust.  I know these easy laces seem to be the latest trend, but they do not work for me.

I have ordered another pair or Skechers shoes similar to these with tie laces."
It BROKE - and now we can't return it.  Seriously - a watch should last more than a couple months.  Return policy was for one month from purchase.
"I read another review that said your foot rolled off the outside and the straps were hard and uncomfortable but I thought well these must be like my Vionic flip flops. NOT!! No shoe that costs this much should have basically plastic straps! Hard, useless for holding foot in place, not really adjustable for a real foot. Like something you buy at the Dollar store! They were so bad I just threw them in the trash. Don't buy them!!!! Is Vionic ruining the Orthaheel brand? I don't know I only know these particular sandals are horrible."
Very cute sandals but when I put them on they are very hard feeling. Might have to wear a good while to break them in. I returned them with no problem's from the seller.
"The look and fit is OK but they feel terrible. If you're looking for ""buttery soft"" LLR-style leggings, these are not that. While they have the same materials in the same ratio, 92% poly/8% spandex, the feel is way off. These feel cold and slippery to the touch, very much not something I want to wear all day, or even for an hour or two."
"I ordered these after reading all the online reviews, thinking they'd be airy, great on a hot humid summer day.
They are fine as underwear, a bit thin in the fabric for my taste, but they don't seem exceptional to me, or worth the cost.
I didn't think they were exceptionally comfortable or provided support better than anything else.
I'll stick to plain cotton boxer briefs from the GAP."
Not true to size. Also the style is not clearly seen in the picture. There are  thin straps just below the bust  that tie in the back. The sides are kind of open. Was very disappointed with this purchase.
"The strap is not long enough to be a real crossbody bag. The purse does not look like the photo, and is cheap looking. I will probably return it."
Its obviously cheaply made. The sequins aren't sewn close together so you can see the material underneath. It feels like a burlap sack. Itchy and uncomfortable. And I ordered the champagne color thinking itd be a nice shiny ivory-ish and instead its a brownish color and the sequins have no shine at all. I decided to buy a dress at Ross for half the price and much more comfortable instead.
I orded a size up and it was too large. Fit was really funny too. Legs were very long. im 59 145 and a medium would have been better.
"I have bought several Frumos tops and the quality and fit have always been good however the ""quality"" on this one is really disappointing.  The quality is very cheap and extremely thin and will have to buy a camisole (another expense) in order to be able able wear it.  I would not recommend buying it."
Not as I expected! I have been wearing Sole sandals for 6 years and loved them!! However these are not at all the same quality as my previous pair.
Runs about 2 sizes to small.
I've been buying 9M Skechers for 3 or 4 years and this is the first time they were tight.
Echoing the concerns here about the backs. One earring literally fell out within minutes. The stones are pretty but the backs are just bunk.
"Would not Buy this brand or type of scrub top again. Fabric is very cheap, it faded badly after one wash cycle and the cotton side panel make the shirt appear as though it is extremely old and I have only worn it 3 times."
"I have a LOT of beach wear, and several rash guards. Ok, this piece was just plain weird. I saw a woman on the beach with one of these rash shirt/mini dresses on and it looked cute, so I ordered this. I totally acknowledge the fault may be im my body. I am 5'3"" and 130 pounds. I ordered a size large because I didn't want a situation where bumps showed. There is a horizontal seam that I can only assume is to cross the torso just below the bust...it hit me exactly in the middle of my bust, making for an extremely odd fit. The top was painfully tight (hard to get on and off dry, so I can only imagine one would be  totally stuck if you got it wet while wearing it. The bottom was as big as a ball gown. Don't know why it looked good on the woman on the beach, who was approximately my size and build. Don't know if I just happened to get one that was accidentally made differently. Big disappointment. Big inconvenience."
"The tank is cute but looked very boxy on me. I like a looser fit so I ordered a medium instead of the small I would normally wear. It didn't matter though, it did not look good on me whatsoever. Quality was good though. I returned and will not reorder a small because I'm sure it will still look boxy. I'm 5'3, 115lbs, 32d and slim in the shoulders. Not a good look for small women."
"Wow, really disappointed in the sizing. I'm a size 38-39 and since Large sized thongs are usually too small in the waist and up front to be comfortable for long periods of time, I mostly go with the XL size. So I ordered this Armani in XL. Got it in and put them on, and felt like I was wearing a size medium skin tight speedo! Even though the waistband is a ""little snug"", the front pouch feels very constricting...not comfortable. The material is very soft and silky feeling, but is skin tight and does not stretch much, similar to a speedo. The product is also made in Thailand, not Italy (like most other Armani products), so that is a disappointment.
At this point, for $36 it would not be a bad thong if it were slightly larger in the waist and in the material used in the front. But to me, its just way too tight and not comfortable to wear.

Update:
As of now I have tried the CK thong, Papi stretch thong, and 2xist Y-back thong. The CK thong is average, but sits a bit higher up on the waist/hips, instead of being low-rise which I prefer. The Papi feels good, but the cotton/Spandex blend is warm (up front) holding in heat and mmoisture. Lastly, the 2xist thong is my favorite since it is Cotton in the front, but is only a single layer so it can breath and not trap heat and moisture.
As far as briefs go, I've tried several and the 2xist Pima Cotton are the best all-cotton briefs. For CK, I like the CK One, Air FX, and others since they are a Nylon and Elastane blend, which actually is not ""speedo tight"" like this Armani thong is."
Fits small and the thin guaze fabric was not what I expected.
Had a horrible wax film on them that could not be removed..they were not shinny as rain boots typically are..very disappointed..price was too good to be true
Ordered a XXL because that is the size that the size chart said to order. I looked at the chart because all the seller reviews said to order a size bigger because this jacket runs small. This jacket barely fit my teenage daughter who wears and adult Med in shirts and Large in jackets. If you order it go 2-3 sizes too big if you are wanting it to fit.
Feathers were falling of immediately  and it felt extremely cheaply made.
"These shoes look super cute, however I ended up returning because size chart was way off by a full size.  Says 6.5"" length would be a size 9 (compared to most charts that say it would be equivalent to a size 10) so I followed their chart thinking they would know what they're selling. That didn't turn out so well...we needed something quick for my son so we had no time to exchange and ended up with a different brand.  Also, I was told this brand is good for wide feet...not so sure about that. Yes, the toe bed was wide on this style but narrower than I was expecting for the rest of the shoe."
"I had HIGH hopes for this pair of summer kicks, but this pair of shoes isn't ideal for me. I have narrow feet, and the toe bed on this style is too wide. Unfortunately, you cannot adjust this part to make smaller. Otherwise the arch support and style is great.... just not for narrow feet!"
Got a hole in them the first time I put them on.
It's just nothing special.  I have issues getting it out of my pockets while wearing dress pants.
"These are neon orange. I ordered them
For my son's Thanksgiving outfit but they were definitely not the right color orange. Had to return them."
"It's a cute tip but much larger than other from the same brand.  Material feels odd, will return."
"The title says it all.  When I opened the package I thought the bracelet looked very nice.  Unfortunately, after wearing for only a couple of days, the bracelet fell apart.  Not even worth the cost of shipping.

Save your money on this bracelet and buy a better quality version."
Received these shoes today. One shoe was worn and the other one was new. Very disappointed!
Just okay. Not as pretty as the picture
"Your feet will get very hot in these shoes.  They're like saunas.

The front third of right shoe (on the right side) had the leather rip away from the soul for about a 3 inch swath during normal walking conditions (NOT hiking)

This pair lasted me less than one year. The souls were already becoming slick before I noticed the blow-out.

Arch support wasn't great, but for most people it should be okay.  The waterproofing worked.  That's about the only positive.

I used to like Keen.  What happened??

Now I have to find another brand.."
"It's see through so not really good for anything, and was very snug."
"Loved the shoes but had to return them.  It was nearly impossible to get them on -- even more difficult to get them off.  Once on, they were fine, and certainly would keep the rain from going inside the shoe, but I won't put this much time into getting into a shoe.  They are a quality shoe that I was going to use as a garden shoe rather than a rain boot.  Sorry it didn't work."
Wrong gloves.  I had ordered the shorter pair.  I returned this pair.
I ordered the gloves a few years ago thinking the product would provide the warmth I need for temperatures dipping very low in the winter.  My hands froze.  The gloves did not work out for me as I expected.
"Did not receive cute print pictures, but the blue/green/white candy print set. Not so cute. I have bought these in the past and liked them, but not very happy with the print I was sent. I may return them. I wish I had read the comments!"
"Terrible, hat arrived caved in, made of hard foam, not worth the price"
Leather is too soft and many holes throughout the shoe.
Loved the shoes until the glued in tassel fell out.  No show repair nearby.  Right now they are held together with tape and can only be worn around the house.
"Bad product!
One of the lenses just popped out the first day of use. How is that possible?
It is not supposed to happen with a product that costs more than 90$. I have been looking for replacement of the lenses and didn't work."
They are a very heavy shoe. Not for long walks. Other wise nice looking shoes.
"Very pretty earrings but the backs don't stayed screwed on. I bought these for my two year old daughter who has her ears pierced since she was 12 weeks and the back to one of the earrings wouldn't stay screwed on. We lost the back within days of her wearing the earrings. The company was very nice and sent replacement backs. Sadly, we experienced the same issue with the backs."
"The shoe is designed to fit loosely so there is really no break-in period.  It is exceptionally well-constructed, featuring double stitching throughout.  The sole also appears to be very durable as well.  I will update as necessary.

UPDATE:  While it's been 6 months since I bought these, I wore them maybe once a week at best and the leather has started to crack on the side of the shoe where it flexes along the toe line.  Apart from the cracks the shoes look new.  I feel like I just wasted $70.  I've owned many Skechers, but I don't think I'll buy another pair."
"The fit isn't a problem with these shoes. I have several pairs of Clarks and buy them because they are both comfortable and stylish. However, these have a plastic buckle, which I could not see in any of the pictures. I would have preferred all leather, or a metal buckle. I am returning these because of the plastic. I would expect more from Clarks."
Wouldn't recommend. Snaps come undone in minutes after putting them on. Don't keep the lower laces tight enough and the upper ones too tight
"I just don't like these, and I like printed leggings. This brand just isn't great. The waist is ENTIRELY too high. I'm 5'2"" and it comes up to my bra, and while my legs may be on the short side, my torso is not. The ankle portion is looser than I expected and there's too much material at the bottom. There are other brands I've purchased that I am MUCH happier with the fit. The material is soft, and there are many patterns to choose from. I'm sad they don't fit better; I really wanted to like these. :-("
The reviews said to purchase a size larger so I did - big mistake!
"Too slippery, catch get a handhold to remove it from my pocket."
All of the watches needed to get adjusted and the cost for that was $20.00 a piece not a great bargain after all that.
"Great for a little kid, but not for a full grown adult. Cheap and worked well as a cash depository for a recent garage sale, but I wouldn't use it for every day. Meh."
"Cute patterns but super disappointed that the zipper sticks when you try to zip them up. You can imagine how frustrating this is in the middle of the night when your baby is hungry, screaming, needs to be changed, and you're stuck yanking on the zipper. Not cool."
"I like Merrell shoes, unfortunately they need to make a wider sandal."
"Initially, I would have given this band a high rating. Today, the second time wearing it, my watch fell off. It probably happened while I was cleaning the snow off my car. One of my favorite watches is now gone forever. It certainly wasn't the clasp because it would have stayed on. I'm guessing the pin where it attaches to the watch somehow got sprung. Probably has to do with the thickness and grippiness of the material. I've never had a watch band do anything like this before. What a disappointment. CAVEAT EMPTOR!"
"Well I should have followed along with some of the other reviews about size.  These are considerably too large.  I usually wear Levi's 517 boot cut, stretch jeans, so being that these are also stretch, I figured these would be about as close as I could get.  I ordered the speckled 38's, as I wear that size in the jeans I previously mentioned, and they were more like 42's.  I must have lost 30lbs between the time I took my pants off to try them on and when I got them fastened.  If these are an accurate representation of size 38, I'm even more ashamed to tell people that I wear 38s.  Maybe with a good, hot wash and dry they'd shrink up a bit, but I'm positive that they wouldn't shrink up enough.  I can't say anything about comfort, because they fell off as soon as I put them on.  I reached for my belt and it laughed at me.  They seem like fine material and that they'd be comfortable, but don't ask me.  This is all too bad, because I ordered them with a fancy coupon.  Otherwise I wouldn't have bought them.  I guess I won't be trying another size."
"Arrived too small but for the price not worth fixing just will be careful not to order from seven till midnight and there ""quote on quote"" plus size."
"This has the potential to be a comfy bra for nursing. However, as a lot of people mentioned, it runs small. So I sized up to an XL when I normally use M or L. This thing is SO SUPER TIGHT it is a complete waste of money."
Cute and fit well but they didn't even keep my hands warm so I returned them.
"Difficult to put on my wrist,with extra long band. It appears to be damaged, in that the end was cut off. Yet if I return it, since I purchased it with a promotion I will lose my money."
Was not true to the sizing chart...
This swimsuit gives absolutely no support. Plus the skirt is funky. I didn't respond right away so idk what to do with it now. Ill sell you mine for 10 bux.
The shoe arrived without the flower (pictured) and was way too small (tight) across the bridge of my baby's foot.
"Way too small and zipper not on right side for a man, that sai I love the design of this vest I wish the manufacture would correct the sizes and zipper to US sizes and I would buy again. Unfortunately I had to send this one back."
too narrow for me.
the problem is they look plastic and feel plastic maybe okay in snow however we don't have much snow in Australia
"Very cheap.  Garbage, as soon as received it."
Bad quality fabric. Not as expected.
"The buckle looks nothing like the buckle in the picture.  The belt itself was pure white, however the buckle was a faint off-white, diluted  banana pudding color. Returning immediately"
"In person, these look very cheap. The material seems like it would scuff extremely easily and is almost like a faux suede microfiber. Not worth it."
"Somewhat small, so I ordered next half size up, and those were a bit to large. Shoe is dainty from inner angle and awkward from outer angle. Was disappointed to have to send them back."
"I wanted a lightweight shaper to wear as an extra layer for warmth.  I'm 5'6"", 174# (once 283# so I know I'm ""heavy-boned"").  After looking at the chart I decided to go up two sizes for plenty of wiggle room.  THAT IDEA DIDN'T WORK!

Received the package and immediately tried it on.  The was a lot of wiggling going on but not a whole lot of room!  I knew I was short waisted but the fit was ridiculous.  If I could stand the pressure from the restrictive waistband I could have worn the waist up underneath my boobs, but the tiny waist would have crushed my ribs!  As it is the waistband rolls down, not once but several times so it looks like a small inner tube.  Not pretty.

I have concluded that this item isn't made for a short waisted woman with no appreciable waist and the size chart is written for women closer to 6 feet tall.  JMO."
They fit just fine but the material is so thin I cannot wear them unless I have a shirt that provides full coverage down to my upper thighs! :(
Ordered my size. Every time I took a step they slipped off my heel. Think they would be perfect for someone with a WIDE foot.
"As others have stated, these are not the same ol' Levi's. The fit is terrible, the material is thinner and the quality is nowhere near what you would expect from Levi's. I have started to look at Lee and Wrangler as replacements. Also,Harley Davidson now has a line of jeans that are better quality and better priced ... and since I own two Harley's, it seems like the way to go."
I was really disappointed in this suit. I wore it once for 20 minutes and the wire popped out of one side! Also it is smaller than the other ones of this brand I have bought. The cup in the top didn't seem to be as wide as the others. I'm a bit irritated because I was really wanting the black top to match some of my other suit bottoms.
already falling apart and I have only had it for a day.
they run smaller than size requested
Returning these shoes.  The memory foam in the bottom stops before the end of the shoes so about half of your toes fall over the end of where the foam lining stops when you walk.  Very uncomfortable to feel that line where the foam lining stops under my toes all the time.
"note - this is a grils swimsuit, not for an adult"
My daughter had them for less than 2 weeks and they broke.
Good for little girls
"These sandals appear to fit but my 3 year old daughter refuses to wear them. She's not sensitive and has never refused any article of clothing before but I have to believe these are just not comfortable. I own my own pair of Saltwaters so I know they can take a few wears to loosen up and break in. An active toddler won't have patience for that, though. They're cute and classic but a no go for us."
"Not soft. Like that the cuffs are tight enough around wrist, and sleeves are long enough. Not liking the fabric. I had one way back that was so soft. I washed this over and over without it softening."
"These underwear were supposed to be size 34, but I could barely shimmy them up over my legs.  The fit was so tight that I could not wear them, even though all my other underwear is size 34 and fits fine. They are also made of a very thin and flimsy grade of cotton, and the fly does not provide enough overlap to keep everything where it belongs.  If you must try these, buy them at least 2 sizes larger - but you would do better with another product."
Insanely small. I wear a size 14 from Lands' End top. I ordered an XL/16 here. It was claustrophobically small. I don't even think the XXL would fit.
Cute! But tiny and impossible to get it on. After several days. I just gave up.
The size is at least one size too big. I had to return them.
"One came broken, can't close"
"I put them only once, when I tried walking was impossible, they are too narrow."
Cheap quality very thin fabric
didn't like bag
i do not the gold one:(
"I am a long-term customer of the brand and I think it is outstanding in its quality. However, the bracelet looks cheap and poor qyality."
"The watch is losing it's outer color and looks bad. This makes the second one that I have bought from you and it reacts to my skin. I only have it on maybe 2 hrs at the most. I don't wear jewelry in the summer because of the reaction to my body.. I will not buy any more if this is the way your product does.
Sincerely,
Sandra Givens"
These ride up constantly and are a much tighter fit in the thighs than the exact same ones I buy in dept stores.
Omg the back is like lace material not beads as is shown in the picture!
"Uncomfortable, thought I would like the long bill but it's annoying to me."
"I have a few other Hanes tshirts & this is definitely my least favorite. Material is not soft & very wrinkled out of dryer. Fit is odd on top, shifts to the side & too slim fitting in the waist."
I order my size but it's small so I return it
Had this an few weeks now n the whole chain turn black it's false adverise not sterling silver i appreciate if refu n d in this chain.  Not able to send it back thank u
"I loved these for a couple of months until the webbing began ripping.  I expect to get more than 2 months from my footwear; of course, I'm very disappointed and had I bought them locally, right back to the store they'd go.  I'll keep wearing them but the rip is getting bigger and bigger so quickly that I don't know how much longer they'll be useful to me (without being a total embarrassment).  I'm also beginning to see a new rip on the other side of the shoe.  Inferior product.  See pics."
"If you have a large bust - this will be too tight / too small.  My wife is a 38 D / DD and she could barely fit - the belt sat at the mid point of her chest, no where near her waist.  The fabric is almost a jersey material - but not cheap - just not high quality."
"As others posted, the patches are on the top of your arms. It's VERY thin. It's not like the SF version."
"They feel cheap, they look cheap, they expand very easily and fast"
"I bought this shirt to wear with leggings and boots, honestly, it looks blah. The shirt comes to a complete point in the middle of your body and it just makes it awkward to look at. Who wants to have a point at the bottom of their shirt? Just get a different tunic with a flat bottom or something else. Maybe if the point was to the side or it was asymmetric, but the point just looks bad!"
I loved the color and I've really liked this brand in the past. But these were very uncomfortable. The rubber between the toes was painful. I ended up throwing them in the trash.
"I am a guy reviewing this.
(Purchased for girlfriend)
We are in agreement on this review:

1. Flat.
2. Old looking, and not in a good way like antique or well oil rubbed metal.
3. Girlfriend said ""We need to give this to Grandma Ruth"". We don't have Grandma Rut! Looks like belongs in a nursing home
4. Bottom looks like thin sheet metal was spun on a machine and bent forward. as a matter of fact thats exactly the tecnique that was used... kind of like when they make pots/pans for cooking. there are ugly stretch marks all over it.
5. Looks like an ugly ash tray a metal worker would make in his/her shop.
6. I wouldn't feed my cat out of this. Looks like would release all kinds of lead/mercury (this is not confirmed, so don't take this part seriously) but does look shady.

*For people that think theirs arrived W/O a screw to connect base with the ""tree"". Check the bottom of the tree. They scree it in there. All you need to do is unscrew it, and then screw back in with the base. Now if its not there, then yes, its missing :)

If you buy it and will keep, i recommend bending the brances to the side to make the tree more 3D like and realistic, but this may cause the branches to snap as they looks cheaply soldiered/welded in place. This thing looks flat like a spatula or a fly swatter.

I looked on amazon for similar items and this one looked like it had the most potential, which is kind of sad as it turns out. I am discouraged from buying this particular product on amazon, BUT I think Amazon is awesome and have bought hundreds of items over the years.

This thing is tiny... only the size of a standard kids' school ruler (12"") I knew this going into this purchase... but just reminding you guys."
After reading reviews bought what I thought was appropriate size.  Not good. Can't even get it on. Too much money wasted. Extremely disappointed!
"Actually, it's a very nice watch, but it's way too big.  It's like carrying a clock around on your wrist.  I think it's perfect for a small child, but not for an adult."
"These are probably at 38 sized for a,person with a,34 waist"
"Returned it. The length was super weird, way too long in the back."
Cut like men's pants instead of women's pants.  Not comfortable.  Difficult to move in.  Impossible to sit in.  Designed to stand up straight and not move. You would think a pair of work pants would be designed to move for work rather than stand around like a mannequin.
"Not for me, returned."
Bought this for my husband for Christmas. Thought since it was Samsonite it would be a good briefcase. Actually it is a very nice one however it is much bulkier than the picture appears and so my husband chose to purchase a different one.
Not comfortable and very cheaply made.. they feel and look fake.
"I have many pairs of Skechers, all a size 8.  Bought these for indoors and couldn't keep them on my feet, much too big.  Was disappointed but Amazon quickly gave me a refund."
"The top of shoe bends when starting to walk .
 It bends into your foot .
New Balance says dedicated to athletes.  Also research and development  is always improving.
 Yes to worse"
They do not compare to the original Ked's.  The canvas is thin and I felt were cheaply made.  Very disappointed in this product.  Will not purchase again.
"I have to return this watch for a second time. My boyfriend wears it on special occasions, so its not like its being exposed to damage or hard labor on a daily basis. The watch just stops working. This is a $300-400 watch that has not lasted 2 months at a time! The battery should not be dying that fast is that's what it is. Now that the return date has expired on Amazon, I have to go through Vestal and its going to take me several weeks to months to try and resolve the issue or get a replacement. Might just go with another watch for all this hassle."
I started itching love me crazy and realized it was this product when I stopped using it. I use the AM moisturizer and it's fine.
Had to be returned. Defective
"Sent it back. Ugly,"
"It's a lot bigger and clunkier than I thought it would be and the black stripes on the band were non existent. I ended up adding those myself with some tape and spray paint, but still the watch was rather dorky. The LEDs were blindingly bright, which is good or bad depending on how you feel about it. The band also snapped into 3-4 pieces in the first month of use. I wasn't too disappointed though. I was mostly relieved to get the thing off my wrist."
"Terrible product. Heavy, too much material and small space. The WORSE: it falls while you are walking since the wheels are right in the middle!! Do not spend your money in this one!"
Very bad quality of seams.
"Thin, clingy synthetic material, and vastly too small, even though I ordered an XXL. The embroidery is GOLD, which does not show up at all in the picture but is very glittery and in-your-face in reality. The torso is also short, so unless yours is also, it will come untucked a lot.

I'm sending it back and not reordering."
"This is a very wide onesie. It didn't work for my daughter because by the time her body could fill it out she outgrew it in length. But it might be just right for some babies, depends on body type."
Totally disappointed with the quality of material and baggy fit. Dress has no pizazz at all. Not consistent with the quality of other Evan Picone purchases made through Amazon. Sent it back as fast as I could. Thank God Amazon allows loyal customers to make a seamless exchange or return of merchandise that fails to meet customer exp ectations.
"I purchased this for a trip to Boston, fortunately I didn't have it more than 30 days, so return option was still in effect. The lining separated in the back along the lower part, the right hand pocket started coming apart with threading falling out everywhere. This is a beautifully designed coat, nice light weight, but warm, great length, but really poor quality of construction, too bad."
"First Northeast snowstorm- stepped in a few puddles- water seeping in. Horrible product. Laces broke from the bottom as well, and I barely use them. Do not buy if you encounter rain. Not even good for heavy snow. Really disappointed with this purchase!!!"
"These are so thin that I ripped them the first day I wore them.  I wasn't doing anything too strenuous or anything, just my usual day at the office."
"Labeled as size 11 and fit like a 9.5
They were pretty cute but a little too small...obviously."
"Didn't fit onto glasses well, very small"
"I wish I had read the reviews beforehand. On the 3rd day of having this beautiful set, a diamond came out. I realize you get what you pay for, but I can get cheaper stuff other places and the diamonds last longer. Disappointed."
"My experience with these shoes has been really bad. I normally wear an 11. Based on other reviews, I ordered up half a size to 11.5. They ended up being just a little too long for my foot. Also, they do not provide my foot any arch support. After running just 2 miles, my feet were in awful pain. It took almost 2 weeks to get over the damage these shoes caused to my feet. I blame this on a poor fit. These may work great for someone else, but that was not my experience. It's too late for me to return them now, and I wish I had never purchased them."
"I bought this for a trip.  I wanted room for my cell phone, sunglasses, chapstick, plus all the credit cards, cash, id, etc.  I wanted to wear it across my body for safety but the strap was extremely irritating to my neck.  I wanted to wear it as a fanny pack but the strap would not stay cinched, so it would just slide down my hips to the floor.  Since the fabric was soft, it became a strange fat lumpy shape as soon as a few things were thrown in.  I haven't used it since returning from the trip, and am now in search of something similar but without the problems this one had."
Not impressed...cheap  quality .
I return it after only 1 week of use. I love that it was a big bag but start ripping on seam and I return it.
These look like grandpa shoes. Not cute. No wonder they were so cheap!
Does not look anything like the picture very disappointed.
"These socks just scream cheap, I doubt they will last for long.

The material is extremely thin. They aren't soft or plush at all, and the stiching is already pulling out of a few.

They were cheap, so there's that. But I'm not expecting to get much more than a few months with these."
not same color
Way too small. :( very disappointed.
These would be good for storage purposes but as far as packing it ended up being very bulky and heavy. I was going backpacking in Europe and originally planned to used this product in my backpack but it did not work out very well. Instead compression bags did the trick and saved so much space.
omg!  these socks are soo tight they wouldn't even go over the heel of a size 9 men's foot.  I am very disappointed and this is my last champion purchase. ever.
"This boot ran large and looked really cheap. I know it was inexpensive, but the photos didn't look that bad. They just looked cheap and we're huge. Also big around my calves, but I have relatively narrow/runner legs."
"Won't fit in shoes- way too big and wide, waste of money"
tooo large!!!!
"Oh how I wish I had read the reviews before buying this costume. I also wished I had tried it on before Halloween. This has got to be the worst costume ever. The velcro placement and the fit was off. I had the hardest time getting his little arms through the arm holes. This things shed like a mother &^%*%$. It was everywhere. I immediately changed out of my clothes. I'm going to have to change the bed sheets. It was too late to give him a bath so I wiped him down with a wet towel, and I'll give him a bath tomorrow. I'm so mad. If I had another costume I would've used that. Shame on them for selling something so poor quality. I took one look at that picture and ordered it; I hope no one else is as stupid as I was. Don't buy this costume. It didn't look like that on my child, the sizing, the way the costume fell on his body just wasn't right. Don't waste your money."
"Unfortunate, as they look very cute, they are not wide calf even with the added zipper. Could not close them. Returning."
"TOTAL GARBAGE, LOOK NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE, THEY SENT ME A TOTALLY DIFFERENT LINK AND THE PENDANT IS THE SIZE OF A BASEBALL, RETURNED IT"
I was excited to get my shoes today only to pull out the littlest size 10 Ive ever seen in my life!! This runs a 1/2  size small! I compared it to another wedge sandal that I have. So disappointing!
Made my small feet look like boats. Sent them back.
THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE WORST SHIRT I'VE EVER BOUGHT. GRAPHICS ARE HORRIBLE. NOTHING LIKE THE PHOTO FOR THE PRODUCT. I can't help but think that these other reviews must have gotten a different shirt than what I got.. because the one I got looks like my dog did the graphics on it. Oh and forget about returning it.. the seller is international and will not respond to refund request.
It's okay. The eye holes should be larger though.
"I was a size 2 before I got pregnant. I used their suggested size chart, but maybe there should be a recommendation of how many months as well. But this is something that i can understand miss-sizing.  Everyone is different. I am short 4'11 @ 111 lbs pregnant at 5 1/2 months. The small was too small. I guess this is something that you would just need to go to the store and eye ball it for your self to get the sizing right."
"Bought these for work, and I like Dickies stuff, but these pants are sized small. they fit, but tight. If I was going to buy again, I would get the next size up"
Cute but not the best quality
"This is the second time i bought shoes in the past 3 months. This fits tooooo biggg. Even with sport socks my finger feel loose.
Its a shame bocouse this boots are very good made. I don't know what is the problem with the size. but it feel like a 9.5 when is 8.
Does not recomend this pair boots in size 8."
Too small and not well made - I returned them.
ok so they  are HORRIBLE NOT WHAT I EXPECTED IM A SIZE M AND I GOT A 2X STILL DON'T FIT! & YOU CAN TELL YOUR WEARING THEM!  if I could refund I would but since I already tried them on I don't think you could refund I'm very disappointed with  whoever is selling it through you because it is a horrible thing a waste of money really I just wasted money on something I'm never going to use so I just lost money Thanks I would not recommend these for anybody unless you already have maybe a little bit of a but I don't know I have one and it just you can see the line as this horrible not what I expected at all
Returned due to poor fit.
This is too small for a 9 year old. Similar material and quality umbrellas are available from othe vendors for lesser price! I am considering to return it
"i got a small and this shirt was huge. disappointed because I never was able to wear it and it wasn't worth the money to try sending it back to China. Wouldn't recommend. If you normally wear a L, order a size small."
looks muchbetter off than on
Should have read reviews first... Completely see through even in black. They ride up under my arms to the point of painfully scratching me. They are so incredibly thin and not comfortable at all..
Don't waste your time. Too small!
Much smaller than original ROC pants
I love this dress BUT it is very small. It even seems to small to be a junior plus which I can usually wear a 3x in. I couldn't even get this on over my head it was so disappointing because there are so many other colors that had it fit I would have purchased more.
"Normally wear large shirts, I ordered large, they looked like kids shirts they were so small.  I returned right away"
Cheapest garbage I've bought in a long time! Save your money!
The size was as expected but the fit was weird.  I returned it.  Not flattering.
I purchased a large dickies scrub top based on the measurements supplied via the advertisement. I have purchased other garments online before following instructions on how to measure for size and they always fit well. With their instructions this was not the case. The length fit but the width was HUGE and I mean HUGE!!! I could have fit 2 of myself inside and I am not the smallest person around. When buying this item USE CAUTION!!
Unfortunately too small....
Broke after 10 days
Ordered a small this dress was at least 12-14 but had nice material it arrived late by several days
"The recipient of this Christmas gift called me yesterday and said one of the stones on these Earrings is missing.  She put away the return item info in the box, hence could not return it herself.
A pity, because she loved the earrings.  I have to say though, the quality of workmanship, and quality control on your part is not as expected, not as it was last year and the year before, when I purchased online ALL my Christmas Gifts through your site.  Is there anyway, she can have another pair of earrings with all of its stones?  Please reply ASAP. Thanks.  The recipient is in Puerto Rico, where the ordered items were sent by you."
I didn't see on the listing that these were for toddlers. Bought these for my 12 year old daughter and they are actually better fitting on my 7 year old.
"These earrings were not green; more clear than anything.  The backing bends, so what it's made of, I will never know.  Very light weight.  Not sure they are even real stones."
Very cheap quality. Broke within the first 5 min I had it on.
"Skirt is completely see through, smells weird, and has no stretch or give at all"
"Pretty, but not for woman with large breast."
"Poor quality, itchy material, WAY too big for my head. Waste of money."
Not happy with the product
Strap burst after one wear
"Bought this for my daughter!  Loved it so much will get one for myself ejected on sale again! So, I did purchase one for myself. After wearing it twice the crystal fell out!!!!!!  DO NOT BUY!!!!"
"Returned.  Cute, but ordered size 7 and they sent 8 which did not fit."
"I almost think these boots were not made correctly.  I wear an absolute 10B, which is what I ordered.  I first thought they were okay but I took only a few steps when I realized the right boot was okay - but the Left Boot was so narrow it hurt my foot.  The strange thing is, my Right Foot is Wider than my Left Foot and yet the Left Boot was so Narrow it hurt to walk.  I sent them back."
"Ordered as Christmas gift. Ordered XXL. Unfortunately, when it arrived I didn't confirm that the correct size arrived. So, when my husband opened it, and it was and XL and he didn't like it, it was to late for me to return it since I had ordered it a couple of months prior. When I was looking at my order to see if I could return it, it did say that I ordered the correct size."
Broke when i was tring to put on ring
"Stockings were too large, did not go high up the thigh, and were not very good quality"
Too skinny for a man's foot.  Need to make this in a Wide size to make this work.
"These seem like they'd be great, but I bought the ""right"" size for my baby.  They're just a little big on her b/c the skid-proof bottom keeps the bottom very flat.  Her foot would have to be as wide as the bottom of the sock to not have the extra material.  That means there's enough real estate for my baby to grab and pull off in record time.  She doesn't even have to do a little kicking.  So she's only worn them once.  The socks from Robeez with the grippers on the bottom work just fine.  They also stay on when she kicks (and she kicks a LOT) so I'm happy with their quality.  These might have worked if I'd bought a size down from what she's actually wearing, but I'm not willing to spend another $13 or whatever they cost now to try out the theory."
NICE  SHIRT BUT WAS WAY TOO BIG
They are not yellow!! They are yellowish green! Have to send them back and not happy about it!!
"Not sure if the type of t-shirt was changed after reading the other reviews on how soft this was.  The shirt was not soft at all.  Very rough and scratchy.  I am returning it.  The sizing seemed OK, running slightly large.  Would not recommend."
Rusted! Cannot wear to my friends wedding which is DAYS away!!!
Terrible.  Sent it back
They are very comfortable and stylish. Keep feet and legs warm. Looks great with jeans as well as skirts. Nice
I had high hopes for this tote but the leather is so thin and soft the tote had no body to stand on its own. Also the cut out lacy feature sags since no support to the leather that I feel it will catch on something and tear. But the tote itself is beautiful and the lovely shade of brown was just perfect. Seems very roomy. I would like to purchase the tote with the wave design but sadly am returning this one.
"cheap price, cheap product."
"Provides little to no support and my boobs fall out, does make for easy feeding at night time though . Its hard to keep the leak protection pads in my bra. A bit more support would be good and better design. Material is pretty comfortable."
"Super cheap.  I buy inexpensive jewelry all the time, and this is the only piece I really hate.  It is made of painted plastic.  You can see the seams from the mould.  Also, mine is missing a black piece, so it's lopsided and looks ridiculous."
Gift for my greatneice...so tiny it fell out  n lost but thank godness it was cheap but cute...
"These shorts have a short zipper that does not allow them to pull over the hips easily and ride up in the crotch.  I bought a size 10 and expected a comfortable fit as I'm 5'2"" and weigh less than 130lbs.  I can't use them.  It is the same with the long pants."
"the material is very thin, the length is small. The fat on your body will show very much. You must be fat free to look good."
all of your unmentionables will be hangong out the under garments that are meant to cover do not cover anything
One of the armbands I received is badly constructed making the set worthless.
The bra was tight fitting even though 38 is a comfortable size for me.  The strap extenders are not long enough - so that the back of the bra with the straps extended to max lenght was way high up my back and not across lateral in keeping with the front.  Did not like.
"Says Large, but is a VERY small coin purse!  I will be donating it!"
Beautiful fabric but the xl came as large/xlarge and fit my teenage daughter who wears a size 5. I wouldn't call that anywhere close to xlarge
"It is very light, but just checked the luggage for the first time and it is now snagged.  Not very rugged...  And also, in less than 6 months, one of the wheels is broken."
I like the shoes bt they didn't fit I wear a size 8 but experience has taught me to always buy larger when online shopping so I purchased size 10 they where  just a size small and way to narrow
"Cheap, cheap, cheap!
it's not worth $30. It's made as well as a play dress you would spend $20 on at a store."
"I will not go into what this did not do for stains across the toes of a pair of boots - but it did not even clean the dust out of the top of the boots (no staining or visible dirt there, just dusty)
Could not recommend this product at all!"
"I returned them, not supportive enough for my feet. Heel felt
Too low."
Too small and looks like a child size.
"Weird fit, got what I paid for?"
Got these for my godsons and my son for my wedding. They were nice but uncomfortable or something my boys wouldn't have anything to do with them. When I tried to return them apparently I waited to long....that stinks. They are not much but with all the money I spent on my wedding it would if been nice to get a tiny bit back
"once again, too clingy"
I'm 5'4 and this dress only went down to the top of my ankles rather than floor length. Too short. I ended up returning it.
didn't get chain
These leggings were too thick.  I exchanged them for the seamless leggings which are sexy and flattering.  Give them a try!
"I loved it at first. A little snug but not bad. After a couple weeks I noticed the seam coming loose under the arm. Not just the stitching coming undone, but the material literally breaking apart at the seam."
Made poorly.  Twisted fabric.
cut right or something.  Not happy at all.
I don't like this at all and in fact returned it right away.  The material feels really icky and I couldn't stand to have it near my skin.
Cute but favric by snaps ripped in one wear
The wallet pockets could stand to be slightly larger.  Removing the cards or money is difficult.
My 8 yr. old granddaughter loves it but the handle broke within one month of use.  It is not as sturdy as the one I bought for her brother.
Definitely for teenagers. Very high on the sides. Nice color.
"These were for my 14 yr old daughter. She was dying to get them, but unfortunately when they arrived, she discovered that they were too tight in the width and the back was really flimsy.  She was pretty disappointed in the overall quality, so we returned them for a refund."
Size runs too large and too wide.
The head portion is very short.
"The handwork is beautiful.  However, it arrived with a broken hinge which was very poorly designed and made."
These fit large and wide.  They may work for you if you have extra wide feet.  The pair I received feel like they are two left slippers (they are not marked in any way).  I have somewhat narrow feet and walk out of them. I will either give the to a friend or donate them.  Shipping was fast.  Product just is not comfortable to me.
"Too lightweight, no cushion around the heel area inside the shoe.  Even though the size fit well, they gave me quite a blister on my heel after only wearing them for 4 hours.  Memory foam not quite as good as the Skechers Burst.  Too bad, it's a nice looking shoe."
"This thing is a piece of crap- do not waste your money on it. It is clearly not a quality outdoor/sport watch. Looks like if you sneezed on it - it would be toast!

Total waste of my money!"
"Fit OK until first washing. Now it will make a nice car rag. Washed using attached instructions, BTW."
The frames themselves are very comfortable. But they absolute;y don't fit over my eyeglasses so I returned them.
This watch is very cheaply made. I had it on the arm of my wheelchair for six months and the stem just broke.
"Not a true red, almost leans towards a very iridescent magenta. Also, the beads were really really big. This just wasn't for me, item returned."
Washed one time and it shrank 5+ inches
Waist for an average 2T was WAY off!  This skirt was ENORMOUS.
"THIS IS ONLY ONE EARRING! The description doesn't state this clearly, so beware. If you buy them, get two to make a pair. It is real gold and small, which is perfect if that's what you're looking for.  A true stud earring. It does seem a bit feeble when securing with the back clasp."
Will not last--the zipper is very flimsy
These are very pretty but way to small for a human. They are on an American girl doll now.
"I bought this for my daughter after she was (wrongfully) accused by another parent of stealing their child's things. It served it's purpose as she was no longer accused of anything, but only lasted about two months before the clear plastic part began to separate from the colored fabric. This would not last a full school year but is a good way to keep an eye on your kids or protect their honor."
I gave this to my dad. It looks incredible. But it's pure junk. Clasp is totally junk. The parts are stamped tin. There's rust in the corners. Not stainless as they advertise.
Ok but the b slim insert made no difference
"nice product, but was way too small for me (5'6"", 139lbs). I had tried it on in the store and it fit in the Medium, but this one I ordered was sized differently."
"It's smooth, silky, and black, which is what I wanted. However, after only a month of wear, the stitching's loose in several places, so much so that the fabric is separating from the trim. Robes such as these are cheap to make and sell and I expected better wear out of a garment I could have bought elsewhere for less."
"I'm giving one star for the simple fact that I ordered this dress in yellow. Specifically to wear to take my daughter to see the new beauty and the beast movie. I'm very dissatisfied because they sent me a red one. And it's not cute. It's a shiny cheap material which would have been great in yellow for the occasion. Now I have an ugly shiny red ""costume"" I'll never wear. Hanks"
"Somehow I expected these to be more comfortable than the average pump, for the price. They are not. Extremely stiff leather resulted in blisters on both heels and top/side of small toes.  No cushioning in sole.  Would not buy again."
The material is sooooo wierd??? I don't think i will ever wear it too... :(
Can't tell from picture but this bathing suit has big Home Boy stripes down the side.  Returned this item pronto.
"I love ECCO shoes, but NOT THIS PAIR! I have other pair that feel very comfy, but this pair felt as if they were eating my pinky toes. There's an awkwardly placed inseam along the outside that rubs against my foot. I wore these a few times and I regretted it every time. There are better ECCO's out there! This pair is so cheap for a reason! :-)"
"Super cute and length fit as expected, but the sides cut into my daughter's feet.  They are just too narrow/firm at the top. She has a pair that is getting to be too small that is a similar style that she loves. The sides are softer and more forgiving. I was hoping these shoes would replace those as they are getting too small. We will have to give these away :("
"Ordered three of these tunics...The white is prefect while the blue fits small and the pink is huge, even after washing.  Sizings all over the place!"
"In my opinion the pants are too bulky and hang loose enough to look and feel really baggy. The weight is just not what I expected of ""sweatpants"" that I am used to. Altogether I'd not recommend these to anyone and I'll probably just throw mine away and learn from the bad experience."
"My normal bra size is 40D. This felt more like a 38C. I will be returning it. Also, it was picky - not something I would want to wear during a workout."
"He couldn't even put them on, not enough clearance for the toes to peek out the top & way too narrow. He wears an 11...  Returning so very inconvenient - esp when handicapped! Door to door is the whole point of ordering online!"
I Would Not Even Give This Dress One star... very cheaply made. It was to small.. I'm 5'3 160lb with No flab it looks like the a gymnastics suit. I trying to give it away. But I may just give to the  good will..
This was too small although it said it was 8.5 inches.  Also has a bad odor.  There is no stretch in the leather.  It looks like it can be repaired via some extra beading that we can do ourselves.  It was so inexpensive that sending it back would cost more than keeping it.
The bags arrived with the zips broken on a few of them.
"If you have to use these on shoe sizes equal or bigger than size 12 mens, do not purchase these.  They will be too small both in width at the front and length to make a difference.  I gave them to my girl to use on her shoes."
I am trying to return this. I used it once ans its broken.. I can't open it now...
Shirt is cut narrow with wide long arms really weird cut
"The sizing information for this product is all wrong. I purchased the toddler size which stated it fit a child 35-39 inches tall and with a waist 22-24 inches. My daughter is 36 inches tall with a 20-inch waist.  The costume did not fit - the body of the suit was way too short & couldn't be clasped. It was too late to get another costume, so I rolled up the bottom under the tutu & had her wear it undone. Thankfully, I had purchased black tights which covered her diaper. I new the quality wouldn't be all that great. Most costumes you buy anywhere are cheaply made. I only expected to get one wearing out of it and that's what I got. What I didn't expect was to get a costume I thought would be more than big enough only to find it too small. BOO!"
"I ordered a size small, this is definitely not a size small. It is so baggy on me that I'm completely unable to wear it. The waist has several inches in a gap on both sides and it would take a lot to ever get it to fit right and the boob area hangs out far, you'd have to at the very least be a b or c cup to fit the top even in a size small. This was bought for me by a friend and I just want to cry right now that they spent so much on something that won't fit me."
"noted ""too large"" as these are not ""no-show"" socks for women's dress flats. They are ""no-show"" sock for Sketcher sneaker-style shoes and Merrell Encore Breeze; worn Injinji toe socks for 2+ years - wanted something similar to wear with dress shoes"
"This jacket is a great work jacket ruined by a poor quality ""Ideal"" brand zipper . It fits me well , it's got just the right amount of warmth for me and I think that it looks quite nice . Up until this afternoon I would've rated it 5-stars . The jacket itself still looks like new but the crimped on zipper pull stopper pulled right out of the material . It left the fabric frayed with no place to re-mount the stopper . I've worn holes in every work jacket before this one , didn't last long enough . Not acceptable ."
Did not like it wasn't comfortable
The color is not the same that the image
Waaaaay too small.  I ordered a 3x and couldn't get into it. The 3x other brands fit fine!!!
I was very disappointed. The top was a little small for my prefferance and the pants were huge. It stinks because you can't pick smaller sized pants. The sizes need to be better fit together. The fabric is a little stiff but I'm sure after a couple washes it will be better. The colors are great but hasn't been washed yet so not sure if they will stay.
Sent them back
My daughter chose to be Super Why for Halloween so I went ahead and ordered this costume. Awful. Not only is it poorly  made AND doesn't look as pictured.. it had a brown stain on the front of it when I pulled it out of the package. I am sending this back and MAKING a costume for her. I can't send my kid out in this piece of trash.
They hurt too much on the top of the foot area. Pretty but other customers were correct.  I cant wear them anymore .
I did not like these because you can see through them. I thought that it was a thicker material as shown on the site.
"I ordered several sizes above what I usually wear.  Dress is adorable, somewhat costumey but cute.  Very short waisted, no room for ample bosoms.  Thought it was well made but more appropriate for a very petite body.  Had to return the dress."
Shape is weird.
Dented Tin box = Let Down. Scotch taped lid. Failed to hold. Watch fell out and bounced all the way to Boston for my Nephew's Christmas gift. He will think I got it hot or it is re-gifted. It's a massive disappointment for the bucks I paid.
"If you've tried these before you know they run small and narrow, always go a size up!"
"I bought a size bigger than normal and still didn't fit. definitely tight around the waist even with a size higher, otherwise nice material and inside has a gel band that keeps them held up."
"These feel super comfortable everywhere but between the toes.  I thought it would be okay being so narrow and not thick between the toes but when walking, my foot moved and pushed against this strap and it was not comfortable. I had to sell them (which ended up being at a loss)  because returning them was too much of a cost. :("
"I think I received a dud. I am a size 10 and I ordered a large. So many reviews were positive. I honestly couldn't get this over my thigh the elastic around the waist was so tight. Again, I think I just received one that was off. I ordered a different jumpsuit in the same size and it fit perfect so I know my sizing is correct."
Cheap looking. Ears don't stay up. Very small. The wings connected & u can't lift your arms up over the shoulder.
I am size 12 too small
"Ordered my typical ladies size 9.5. They arrived quickly and are my favorite shade of pink so I was super-excited! However, after putting them on, I was a little disappointed when I could see where the seem was poorly sewn (an imperfection) and although it bothered me, I decided not to let it be a deal-breaker.

Within the first moments I noticed that the cushioning in the sole feels like it is a long, narrow channel with a pillow-y feel, but it was kind of uncomfortable but I thought maybe once I wore them for a bit, it could flatten out and still be ""doable"".

After wearing them and walking into the other room, I noted that the heels were sliding down, so I tightened u the drawstring which I was hoping was just for looks, but actually is required to keep the slipper on the foot.

I then wore them around the house for maybe an hour, I noticed pain in my heel area. I checked and sure enough a blister had formed where the drawstring was rubbing against my heel. Blisters from slippers is a first for me!

Anyway, I'm returning them.  See my pics for more info on the mis-sewn edge and the blister. Please note the looseness of the drawstring, as I did not feel I over-tightened them. Thanks for reading and hopefully I save you some headache and a blister or two."
"These pants fit great and are comfy, but I was not impressed with the overall quality. After wearing them one time, I realized there were many small holes just under the seam where the gray part folded over. I sewed up the holes and am hoping those will be the last..."
"Cheap, $5 Wallet."
"I won't give this product one star as I admit the lenses seemed fine for the price. The issue here is the measurements of the glasses and nowhere on the product page will you find it.  What should be a clue for all is the fact these glasses are advertised for men and women. As a man, I should have assumed that they would be too small for me as I consider my head to be relatively large. In fact, in selecting reading glasses from another seller I made sure the information mentioned only men's styles and included the width of the frame and the length of the arms. I suspect for most men they will encounter the same issue I encountered."
I like the shoes; they are comfortable. The problem is the plastic tip/strip painted on the toe of the shoe. After just a few weeks of having the shoes the strip has started to crack and crumble like old paint. Makes a new pair of shoes look gross and old.
This dress look more like a night gown....ughh
The leather padding around the back is already split and falling off.  These shoes are poor quality
"It is a very good product, but this particular one is very narrow and would not be walking, I lost money."
Way too thin. Stretches out in just one wear. Wasn't happy had to throw it away after first wash
"I hate that it turns my wrist green.  I loved it so much.  It is a very elegant and stylish bracelet and I enjoyed wearing it...until it started turning my wrist green.  I never expected that, especially after paying $22."
One of the chains were broken before I even opened.
"I had heard a lot of good things about these boots and they looked great, so I ordered a size 7 M in ""wheat."" When they arrived, I saw that the boots were a size 8 placed in a size 7 box. So I made a phone call and through some difficult negotiations with amazon.com customer service, they agreed to send me another pair free of charge. However, when the second pair finally arrived I discovered that this time it was a size 7.5 Wide in a 7 box. One of these mistakes I could understand, but twice was too much. And to make things worse, by that time, the size and color of the boots I wanted were unavailable. So here I am over a month since I first placed my order and still boot-less."
"Was so disappointed. Way to small, at least 2 sizes too small. Really wanted them too."
Baggy when ordered by bra size. Itchy. Returned.
After two weeks and the T-shirt shrank. For the price I feel I wasted money
"very itchy, we sent it back"
I ordered a women's 10 and received a men's 10 instead. They were too big for that reason. They should be more clear or careful with their sizing options.
This ring came apart but I like the look
This product came in Chinese packaging. I didn't pay attention to this when I ordered these. The buckle on the shoe looks like some sort of dangerous metal contraption that doesnt stay closed. Not a fan.
"These are so beautiful and feel like they are of decent quality but they are too small. I am 5'6"" and they wouldn't come up any further than over my knee. I was really disappointed because I paid quite a bit for them and I really liked them. If you are over 5'3"" I wouldn't recommend them.
I am going to give them to my niece who is 5'2""."
ugh
"it's very loose fitting.  probably good while pregnant, but not when you're nursing."
zipper problems from the beginning
"This dress was awful. Not only is it totally see through, the way the top of the dress fits is completely unflattering. It looks very baggy and bunchy. The material was scratchy and felt like it would remain that way after a few washes. Returned immediately."
"I have already sent them back to you. I don't know why they didn't fit, I already have a pair of fatbabys and I love them."
Disappointed! These boots were advertised as having a wide calf and the calf was not wide at all! I gave the boots to my daughter who is 5ft.four and weighs 115 and they were too tight!!! Should make more accurate decision. Hopefully someone is enjoying boots as we donated them.
I felt i losse my money on it. It is ridculus how big it is!
They look adorable but the fit is tight for a wide width.
WAY TO SMALL people with thick hair don't buy
"Up front:  I do not own this product.  It may be great.  But I strenuously object to companies putting 'bait and switch' prices on their websites.  The ad says this product is available for as low as $4.90.  Actually, there is NO size or color sold at that price.  The lowest price is $8.93.  Shame on you, Barelythere.  There is no reason to engage in this type of lying."
Bought for my daughter not true to size
"There is no significant 'secret panel', the fit is not particularly significant and the fabric not particularly stretchy or durable. Get a good pair of well-fitted jeans, instead!"
Just ok; target makes a wayyyy better one by gilligan omalley! 18 bucks and it's more comfy; this was stiff and cheap; womp womp
Runs smaller then other shirts that are the same size
"i love the product line in general and have black, taupe, dark brown, etc.  i bought these for summer use with lighter colors pants and clothes.  BIG mistake, the get very dirty very fast, show every spot and will not easily clean.  this is why i gave it one star.  if the light color and easy stain does not bother you, get the product."
size shown is not accurate. blouse is at least 2 sizes smaller.
"Great scarf, nice fabric and good colors. However, I feel the sides are not very neatly hemmed, and even in the new ones one can see the threads hanging out. Other than that, the scarf is pretty nice and the hat is much, much nicer!"
Another dress that it just too expensive for my budget. It is also dry cleanable only which will add to the cost of the dress. I especially do not like summer dresses that have to be dry cleaned as they tend to need dry cleaning so much more often - like every time you wear them. The neckline is a little too low for church in my opinion. The color is not very bright and somehow reminds me of an old fashioned time when ladies stopped wearing black for mourning after a period of time and started wearing grey or this drab looking color. I would also like to see a little more length to the dress for the price.  It looks like I will be wearing my old dresses to church.
Its a really cute clutch but just too small for my taste and purpose
Very very dainty chain
"I love this shoe. I love it so much, I bought it twice.  It's the perfect summer pump.  The lace is adorable, but professional.  I wore this to work, to church, to parties.  Out of my whole closet, I probably wore these once or twice a week, while other shoes I wore once a month.

Wore. Past tense.  I've owned this shoe twice and both times, within a few months of buying it, the elastic on the sling-back gave out. They went from being my favorite pair of shoes to being un-wearable. They'd clack around, they'd no longer fit, and there's nothing you can do except decide if you want to buy another new pair of shoes that can break on you. Again.

So enjoy them while they last."
I ripped both pieces when I received them
"Loved this, but it was too small.  I usually wear L or  XL.  Bought this in XL and it fit like a medium so I had to return it.  Would buy in both colors if it fit better."
"They seem to be good quality but are a bit too big, wonder if I should have ordered a 1x......

I am a 3x and ordered 2x but they are just too big....."
"The dress was beautiful, I was surprised at the quality for the price, however it was way way too small for me amazon was awesome with the return"
pretty short footbed for size 11... wearable... should have bought next size up.... very well made good durable wet worrk sandals
"This is a darling bracelet, but it was too big for my wrist. I gave it to my granddaughter and she liked it very much."
thought this was going to fit with a little more room at the top for it to fold over but it doesn't. Still cute and functional.
"These are really cute shoes.  What I like about them, in addition to the style, is that the toe box is very roomy - no squashed toes!  However, I give them only 3 stars for two reasons:  the zipper/elastic comes up high on my foot and it rubbed a blister right where my ankle bends in the front (now I can't wear them without socks or a preventative bandaid) - and - because it offers absolutely no arch support.  I've had to go out and by arched insoles, which never work as well."
"two main issues for me:
1. it shrank way too much after first wash. It essentially became too uncomfortable to wear. thrown away.
2. it lost color too much as well."
"I have been buying these Hagar slacks for years.  They have changed their specifications and current ones are NOT as good
as old ones. I read someone had frayed cuffs?  HAHA..  Obviously person wears their trousers long enough for cuffs to  drag on the ground. If a problem, get shorter trousers.  Or longer legs...?  Old ones had both a button and a metal connector at the waist.  New ones a simple button...  not as good.  Since i want black, options are slim. I have found that Travelsmith till makes black ones??"
These shoes wore down faster than they should have. I have already purchased a new pair of shoes.
"super cute, still holding up well. bought it a few years ago and still intact."
"They are nice; however, a lot smaller than I expected & preferred."
"The crown on this thing has a ridiculously gritty feel, and it's very hard to get the thread started when locking it down. The bracelet clasp is just horrible. I have another similar older Invicta of this type and the difference is very apparent. Also the lume on this model only lasts about 30 minutes if you are lucky. I have both of my Invictas beside one another in my watch winder and if you charge them both up at the same time the older model is visible for almost an hour, and the immediate difference is apparent in about 2 minutes. The bezel looks cheap in person too.
Improvements from the older versions include a hacking movement and a much better cyclops.
It's an ok watch. The actual color of the bezel which is much lighter and more of an anodized aluminum look makes this model look more like a toy than a nice watch.
Look I'm not a watch snob, I have two other Invictas which I like just fine as well as a load of cheaper Chinese watches (Naviforce) as well as a few better watches (Seiko 5, Casio Diver) and a couple really fine ones (Breitling, Omega). I know what to expect from one of these and I don't have any ideas about how an Invicta is supposed to behave, this particular one is less than typical. The movement seems ok though and it keeps time well. I'm going to remove this POS bracelet and put it on a NATO, and while I'm at it maybe touch the edges with fine sandpaper (They are sharp) and re-polish if needed.
I purchased this on Prime Day for about 55 dollars, so I guess I can't complain I got what I paid for. If you are looking to get this at regular price it's an ok buy but with many issues. My recommendation is to skip it, buy a Seiko 5 diver if you want an automatic, it's a better watch, inexpensive, not really as flashy, but the pictures compared to this watch in person just don't match up. I may change or update this review if my experience improves as I believe it will with a better strap and some other work.
Bottom line, there are much better options for the money."
I have to double up in sports bras to get the support I need.  I am disappointed because I read many reviews that said that this sports bra had decent support for larger bust sizes.
"Was too large for me, but I loved the style."
32B always fit me perfectly but this is a bit too short and I am using a bra-extender so that I can wear it.
"Fit well and arrived quickly. The only disappointing thing was that they say multicolored pack and all the colors were black with one dark navy included. I was hoping for some fun colors like what was pictured. Overall, though, we'd buy again as they are exactly what we hoped for in undies."
"Bodice is not made well. I was able to have this altered. It's worth it to me, and expected, as I'm used to finding that most clothing lines have terrible ideas on how to tailor dresses for larger women. The quality of the fabric is great. My seamstress was happy to work with it."

I like the style and thin mesh watchband.
The dial is easy to read.
I had lost my previous Skagen watch. I'm happy I was able to replace it with this one. ~jane"
"I wear an 11 shoe, and the XL was more of a medium. I had to return them."
I usually wear a medium but I ordered and extra large. It is a bit snug.. and not as flattering on the tummy as I had hoped. Its still super cute though. It gives me motivation to lose a little weight.
The box itself is not bad.  The one that I've received had some scratches on it though.
"This item is no where near as big and flowy as it apprears in the photo. It's really cute, just misleading"
"""I was very excited when these arrived still in one piece each. I gently washed them to put them on then I noticed I had one hinge in my hand and the other one gone. Both earrings came apart where the hinges and go thru your ears. I found the missing piece put them back together and pinched with pliers. Must wear carefully.
So I am aware of it but they are real cute so I am willing to deal."
"Hubby did NOT like this shirt. It looked like a ladies shirt on him. You can even see the ""moobs"" on the t-shirt model. Not very flattering. He won't wear it, so I have a big shirt to wear with my leggings. :)"
"The cardigan was not as pictured the sleeves and bottom edges are white trimmed , at least the sweater I received was .My son's school is firm on their uniform dress code,kept the sweater hoping the white passes dress code."
"This dress was cute and as described, but unfortunately my mom was swimming in it. The lower part of the dress that flares out beneath the elastic part on top made her look very round and inflated. She's 62 and about 120lbs; not sure what the perfect body type would be for this dress. Maybe a ""fuller"" individual."
Doesn't fit well under my arms or on my chest.
"I like this dress a lot, and it would've been perfect to wear to classical music performances where you need to wear a full skirt, BUT, it is way too big. I usually wear a 6 in these types of dresses, but not in this one. It is big, and it looks unflattering, and it is also too long. I'm afraid that the cost of hemming the dress, and sizing it might be way more than the cost of the dress itself. This is truly a shame, as I really, really liked this dress. The bow tie it comes with is simply divine and it looks well put together. A simple concept that works well for any occasion. If I could buy it again, I would.. but I already spent money and time with this dress and it was initially given to me at a discount (not much) in exchange for an honest review. Honestly, check the size chart, you might be a size smaller than you usual dress size."
"It feel quite cheap, but what do you expect for the price."
"Got these for my husband who has 11.5 4e (extra wide) feet and he could barely get them on. His father, however, swears by these shoes and is an ER doctor on his feet for 12 hour shifts. Neither guy cared about the style, but I thought they were really ugly shoes."
"This dress runs one size too small, I wear size small and the medium fit me perfectly but I am busty.  If you are size small and not busty, then size medium might be too large for you in the chest area.  It is slightly below the knee, the asymmetrical whiter part looks nice. Overall, it is not a bad buy for the price."
"the short is very loose for a 36 waist. the pouch is ok if you are  not above average package, too tight if u are. have not used it yet on water."
"Pleased with service and price point, don't really know why this size of Puma differs from other brands."
"These shoes are pretty nice, though they do get very warm. Luckily I got a light color, so it helps a bit with the heat, but I wouldn't recommend these in a dark color for summer hiking.

A major problem I found, is that these things tried to kill me twice. On a hike up to a waterfall, the loop part of the lace of my right shoe (which I double knotted) caught in the top hook of the left shoe, and I hit the ground. Luckily, someone was there to make sure I don't go over the edge, but that could have ended badly. The second time I wore these on a day in the city, and the same thing happened while crossing a busy intersection. Luckily I knew the feeling and knew how to undo what my laces did and I didn't fall... but that could have been bad, too...  I tuck the laces under each other now."
Way too large. 2 sizes above normal. Great material though
"These are very wide, and I had to put inserts in them since there is very little padding."
the material tended to stretch out.  I would have preferred a brief with more stretch
"This cardigan was smaller than the size. I believe it shipped from overseas so that would explain the size difference but I bought an x-large, which usually more than covers me, and it fits like a medium.  It works but it doesn't feel loose like I like them to feel.  The material is also extremely thin so don't get this for warmth"
A little ugly for the wear. But it's a scrub so I don't care to much. It's a good price and came quickly.
"These are great boots for running outside with the dog in rainy weather.....  The width is generous, but the length is a little small for the size.  I wear a seven in almost every shoe style, but these are a little short.  They will do for the quick trip outside, but they would not be comfortable for a long period of time."
Love the color of these shoes they definitely get attention but the backs are so high I get blisters from them.
The fabric look silky for my liking
Took a little time to get to me and they seem a little big but all in all very happy with them
"These are very thin, they are barely thicker then spandex. They are also very narrow with no real waist band. They fit closer to the way tights fit. They do look similar to jeans. And they are soft inside."
"Lovely to look at, too heavy to hold."
"I'm 220lbs size 18-20 Got size 3xl Fitz perfect!!!!
Doesn't slide down at all you can bend, seat, holds in place!!!!!! must have!!!! Also the bottom is great it doesnt ride up and totally breathable"
The dress fit correctly! The problem is the dress rides up when walking or sitting. Who has time for this nonsense!
I like the earrings and they show up and look good on but the stones are not great. One has some blue flashes. I would rate better if stoned were better. I enjoy wearing the earrings.
The Asics 20 for me somewhat smaller than regular size. I'm 5.5 but I bought 6. It was squeezing my small toe and I don't hAve a wide feet. It looks good though.
Fabric thinner than pants ordered from Macys
"These are very pretty but were way too big and heavy for me.
I am just 5 feet and so they were out of proportion for me.
Also be aware that they are heavy.
If that doesn't bother you then bling bling bling for a fancy occasion.
Also the pair I received the posts were not very sturdy.
I had to return them."
"I like the graphics on the shirt, but am disappointed in the quality of the fabric.  It's quite thin and lightweight- I'm not sure how long it will last."
"The pendant was beautiful but I found the chain was so thin that I would have been scared to wear it, so I returned it."
"Boot itself have good design,but the sizing chart is wrong,also the upper part of the boot don't fit properly,sizing is the problem,way too large."
My daughter had a few dollars and wanted some scarves. The quality is okay. It's what you'd expect for the price. She is happy with it though.
"Sole is very soft. Can feel anything, like a stone ,"
"I was looking forward to getting these shoes from all the great reviews.  They are very lightweight and comfortable.  No blisters at all during the first couple of wears.  I don't feel there is enough support though.  Also, will have to buy some inserts for more cushion."
"If you need a dress in a pinch I suppose this would work. It would look better if I were bigger than a 40C cup size- maybe a size 14 at 5""5' at the most- then I could pull it off without looking pregnant and janky. Someone with a flatter stomach and va-va-va-voom cleavage would look better in this than what I do. The color is pretty (even with my skin tone is whiter than Wonder Bread and I can't hold a tan) but it's really long and much more A-line than what I was hoping for. The cups and bodice are nice where you can get away with wearing a regular bra or a strapless without any peekage.

If I were not looking to impress anyone, it seems really nice to loaf around in. The the fabric is really, really comfy and breezy. It's certainly not a semi-fancy dress on me lol..."
"It's made of cheap material but it was also an inexpensive dress. You get what you pay for...
It worked for its purpose, Christmas.
I ordered a 2T, fits my 21month old ok but it's a little big."
Quality was good but definitely not wide calf style as claimed
More than happy too small too short
"The suit is very pretty and the company gave me great customer service. However, buy a size larger at least. It runs very small."
"OK, maybe I'm getting picky, and fat. I don't mind the kind of greasy leather - it will break in. But, go up a couple extra sizes, then maybe another. These run very small."
The velcro is too scratchy
"Unfortunately it brike the second time I wore it. I was being so careful because it is designed beautifully, was easy to put on and made me feel very feminine. So, I had to update my original review.

Easier to put on than I thought it would be, and I have arthritis. It is light and comfortable and very dainty but sexy at the same time!"
I was knee length not over the knee as I expected... so I returned them but they fit my 8sz well
the only redeeming quality of this shirt is that it fits and covers me modestly no added support or slimming shapeless polyester Tshirt
Definitely awkward fit.
This is good enough for the price.  It runs long as everyone mentioned and the way the tummy clings is not flattering.  I bought it because I needed a red tank to work out in.  This won't make the cut--it's best for layering under something or in my case--pj's.
grand daughter loved it but quality was not amazing
"Definitely size up. You'll get compliments every where you go
as they are adorable. And so warm.
But ...they just aren't made to last.
These are One Season boots.
I'm rough on footwear and can't complain that they
are no longer useful,  because i didn't pay much,
But now I'm back to wearing my Bos & Co all-leather well-built boots in good and bad weather."
Don't seem straight to me.  They fit as though they were cut with a significant taper toward the ankle.
"Controls well. Crotch opening to go to the bathroom.

Downside: The straps really hurt my arm pits.  By the end of the day they are completely sore.

The leg openings cut into my thighs (Spanx don't do this).  I'm a size six and don't have large legs -- so that this is possible is even strange to me."
"The shorts are nice on my skinny teenage daughter. Sadly, I had ordered them for myself, but they were way too tight. I am a size 4 always, and even after consulting Danskin's size charts, there is no way that these would fit a size 4, unless you are happy looking like an over stuffed sausage."
"The top..just no. The skirt worked perfectly for my Halloween costume, I just had to wear it high waisted. Threw the top away because it was a gross thick, stiff, weird material that didn't even make sense."
"Not very flexible, but well padded under velcro closures."
I mistakenly ordered med
This is the 2nd set I purchased.  Love the 1st set.  The top with this one did a shrinking act the first time it was washed.  The large is about the size of a medium while the pants are the size of an x-large.  Odd fit.
Okay wouldnt buy again
Should have spent more $$ & gotten the earings thicker .
"The top itself is too cute. However, I usually wear a 1X, I ordered a 2X and I couldn't even get it over my shoulders. That's why it gave it a 3.  So yes they run extremely small. I didn't return I have nieces that would love."
Not a good choice for wide feet.
"I ordered a L after reading the reviews and I am 5'5"" 125 lbs.  The bottoms fit well, but the top was a little loose and the padding inside made my boobs appear to be triangular. I worry if it take the padding out then you will be able to see through the suite since it's white. Will be returning."
"I actually loved the feel and look of this shirt.  I just didn't like it on me.  It was too clingy of a fit in my midsection, so I returned it."
Fit is a little smaller than I am used to
My son absolutely loved it. Bought it a size too big for Christmas gift and it fits tighter thats it should.
"Didn't shrink and does not feel like cotton, so I'm thinking it's a lie that this is 100% cotton. I don't wear this often as I don't like how it feels on my skin."
Arrived as stated. Shoe just a tad too large. Only worn once. Need to break in .They are tight over arch. Color not the same as picture. Since its not a dress shoe they should work. I like the style of the shoe.
"Hoping they would have a chunkier sole, but fit. Had a pair like them years ago and wore them out."
The bra fit as expected and looked very sexy. Its a great tease for your partner and they will love the surprise when you undress!
The length of the shoe seemed to fit but the arch support wasn't sufficient so these were returned.
Quality is a bit cheap
"This was cute and fit true to size but the metal bar of the halter top was slicing my neck!  I couldn't wear it for 30 seconds.  If you can tolerate that, then go for it."
"Nice quality but way too small.  I wear a medium, and large was too small."
it's no longer gold fyi. its now changed to silver but hasn't broken yet. not sure if i'll get another one but i like it.
sleeves were longer than expected
I thought the material was to thin! They fit okay
"While these are good looking, they are very big at the waist, which makes it necessary to keep pulling them up. Regretfully, I will be returning them. Note: Sadly, these days I am not as small around the waist as I used to be, so it's not because of that! And they are not a high rise, so being a bit lower, they are ready to slide down before I even move."
"This is a nice little key chain for those who love Zelda. I felt it was a bit too expensive, but my little boy loves it."
"Keeps time very well. The grosgrain wrist strap is not comfortable or easy to put on. The grosgrain is stiff, the ""keeper"" band is hard to keep in place. It would have been nice to have an upgrade available so you could choose a nicer strap."
Love these earrings! Cheaply made.
"The bra itself fits pretty good. The side supports are way too scratchy and I find myself tugging at it frequently. Also, the straps are way too wide for my tastes. Not returning it but not thrilled with it. Definitely would not recommend."
"Fine jewelry this is not, but it's pretty heavy for the price.  The eye is a bit bigger than I expected, and the chain is too long.  (I'm planning to replace the chain.)  It's quirky and cute, and I'll wear it with casual attire."
"This bra has some nice features, but it was ultimately not the bra for me.

Aspects that I liked:
-It was true to size... I'm a 34A, and the 34A fit perfectly.
-It's easy to lengthen/shorten/criss-cross the straps while wearing it (if you click on one of the higher resolution front-view pictures, the circular plastic between the strap and the cup is actually a snap).
-The fabric is soft, and the stitching looks sturdy with no frays/loose threads.
-It lives up to the claim that it's invisible under shirts. I didn't think it would with the thick upper/front edge, but that edge is close enough to the midline of the body that shirts don't rest there.

Reasons I knew I had to send it back:
-The elastic was a bit stronger than I like, and while I don't want a bra that slips around, I do want a bra that is comfortable enough that I can forget I'm wearing it, and not have to count the seconds until I can take it off.
-The cups were floppy... Yes, they have a tiny bit of foam, but it's not the type that holds its shape off your body, so it's more likely to become creased and lumpy with age, which is a deal-breaker for me.
-Most importantly, though, it just wasn't flattering on me, so I didn't feel confident in it at all. As another reviewer mentioned, this bra doesn't lift at all; it separates. So while I was hoping this bra would work (so I could order it in all the lovely colors Amazon has to offer), it definitely didn't.

By the way, if you're around my size and any of the above resonates with you, try out Lily Of France Jacquard Demi Underwire Convertible Bra (2121260) and/or Lily of France Womens Your Perfect T-Shirt Bra... I tried and loved them both!"
I really love this. It fits my face perfectly. I keep getting compliments and I'm often asked where  I purchased them. My only complain is that I read that they come with a sack which mine didn't. :(
They did okay they did their job but they broke down really easy they could be a little thicker on the sides and the straps other than that they did okay.
Color was not same purple
"The small size was wide . Despite being a slim shirt, I had to take it to a tailor notching . My height is 1.75 m and my weight of 145 Lbs ."
"Wow! Other reviewers weren't kidding. I hardly ever wear a size 7 so despite the reviews that they run small bought the 6.5s. They are way too small so I am exchanging them as they are really cute, though, the heels are really high."
"was kinda of disappointed being an ugg boot. If these were a no name brand then I would be very satisfied but I have come to expect more from Ugg over the years. I purchased about a dozen pair of ugg boots and shoes over the past 3 year,  all of the boots I have bought have had a thicker padded layer of sheep skin on the inside of the boot and with my most of my other boots you can wear them without socks and be completely dry and comfortable because the entire inside of the boot is covered in sheep skin, but the skimped on these and the foot bed is not lined"
Very narrow not at all what you'd expect being k swiss was not happy with them at all
"Fit was good just wish that the colors shown is what I would have got instead of Lavender & Green. So all I got that I can wear is 3 pairs of boxers.
Their is no way I'm wearing the other 2 colors. Fruit of the Loom who are you making these boxers for Men or Woman? I would order aging, but don' want to waste money & only get 3 pairs again when I'm paying for 5 pairs of boxers."
Very cute. I ordered up as reviews had suggested. The sleeves are borderline short and it is still a little too tight in the abdomen. But for the price quality of fabrics is good
Tough but on inner ring reckless paint job for black tent but who's to say my finger has to take off the ring???
"Uncomfortable fabric and felt like it was slipping down all the time.  One of the padded liners had been crumpled in shipping so I didn't get a smooth look under clothing.  This would probably work great for someone who has high, firm breasts or surgically enhanced - just enough bra for modesty but nothing much in the way of support or shape."
Need more boobs for this...but other then that my boyfriend loved it...couldn't keep his hands off my Ass
They're super soft but also super thin.  Returned.
Definitely made in China! You get what you pay for. Not quality but it will protect from the sun.
The problem I have with this is that it rolls up. But I like it and it looks expensive.
It's like wearing warm cozy socks.  Definitely not a supportive slipper.  Not able to walk with them outside.
"it is absolutely perfect....until you put it on.  i got it yesterday, and just trying it on 3 buttons fell off! luckly i know how to sew.... just disappointed that it happened the minute i got it..."
"I gave these 5 stars originally but recently, the colors have not been close to the same nor the fit. They are too baggy in the inner thigh which defeats the purpose of having these... it's a shame!"
Ordered the size my daughter normally wears and it was way too big. Returned and reordered the next smaller size and they are still a big large.
"I bought these to go under my regular socks to help cushion my bunions. I recieved these and decided to wait until the weather gets colder to wear them. I bought them to replace Dr. Scholl bunion pads. I just don't want to keep buying those bunion pads. I am trying everything I can to not buy bunion pads, even though they work. I just don't like spending the money."
"The shoe is really cute. These shoes look well made and softspots are usually so comfortable.  However, these were just too wide and I could not tighten them. The strap & buckle is just for show.  These aren't C width, they're D width."
A little stiff and a little wide but otherwise ok
"I ordered an extra large, it fits but I have broad shoulders so it's not as comfortable.  I expected it to be larger.  I just wanted a hoodie I could relax in and where around the house.  I wouldn't order this again."
"Nice shirt except, I didn't like the Calvin Klein label appearing much more prominently in real life than it appears as pictured. Returned it although I wear a lot of other Calvin Klein shirts whose designs are more subtle."
Too small and legs weren't long enough
Works fine. Much bigger than I thought it would be. Now if only the watch would keep better time!
The color is beautiful so I was disappointed in the size.  I wear a 10/12 misses blouse so I thought ordering an XL would be OK.  There is about an 8 inch gap in the front so I am not able to button it.  Will use it as an over shirt.
"The description and pictures do not correspond to what actually sold.
I wanted to buy exactly what I saw. But was disappointed. Although the fit of Lee as always good."
Will have to return bc they are too large.
The head piece was huge and does not fit as the picture shows.
I bought it but did end up returning it. The back straps were to loose. The suede texture makes it look cheap.
It runs small--the sleeves was not long enough. was given to someone who could fit it
"It is a smaller size, I owed a lot of Reef pairs, this model is not as comfortable, too hard. Good looking"
Very pretty but I had issues with both taps. One came out and the other would squeak until I pulled it out with plyers. I super glued both so hopefully that fixes them.
Too shiny for my taste so back it goes.
"You need at least a whole size bigger, it's a shame they aren't sized correctly as it's the prettiest shade of brown I've seen in ages, it's more like doe than brown."
"Nothing special about this. I ordered the yellow but it's really a baby poo green color, not a nice yellow color.  I'm not sure what the front zippers are there for. Not a lot of space or compartments.  The top is open, wish there was a zipper there.  This isn't really a good purchase."
One size does not fit all. :(
"I am going to keep these shoes, because they are really cute.  But the toes is very narrow and they don't have the comfort that I had hoped for.  I am hoping that once I wear these a few times, they will relax a little bit."
Very nice fabric and fits well but pants sit on hip and do not sit on waist which is great if you are 16 but not comfortable for older women.
Ferber makes their gowns so thin. Im not sure how they would hold up to washing. Ive found other more substantial gowns that I love for not much more. For the price they're fine. Theyd be great for an hot natured baby.
Fits small around the waist
"not like my good old Levi's from the '70s, but fit well.  The legs are too baggy.  They should fit better, but I guess all jeans are made like that now i.e for chubby people."
"I ordered the Lindy Bop classy vintage Audrey Hepburn dress and the petticoat accentuates and makes the dress flow.
The reason I gave it three stars is because I have to pull the petticoat down just beyond my hip bone to get the best effect.
After I get up from sitting it needs to be adjusted down again.  All in all, I'm happy with it.

Jene from N.J."
"The oversize is correct.  A little too big I think.  The frame is a diffent type of plastic is light but stiff. Looking for a diffent pair.  The blocking of the sun is nice though, so they will work for now."
Nice bra but can't wear. L for 38DD is too tight and you get boob overspill and underspill. Cute for smaller chest or order a size or 2 up. Tried to order size based on chart and reviews... oh well.
"The ""red"" ended up being more orange than red, but i love the shape.  Will probably by the other colors anyway."
"very thin, got a few holes after the first few washes"
Fit my nephew but it was a little small
"I brought this for my mother.  She loves it.  The pants fit great, but the top is a bit small around the arms and bust area. The pj itself is beautiful.  My mom asked if she could wear it outside and I told her to don't try it. If the fit was perfect it would of been 5 stars."
I love altra but I do not like the these newer ones. The 1.5's were way better. These seem to have no support on the inside of the shoe. Last year's model hugged my feet and helped my ankles from turning in When I run. Now I'm back to having shin splints and I am not happy. Also what happened to the wide tow box? These are much more narrow then the 1.5's not an improvement from last year if you ask me. I gave a 3 star because of those two reasons above. They fit great and I can use them for my walks I just can't run in them.
"I think this may run a little small. I followed the size chart and when I received the pants, they fit snug."
The blue doesn't stay dark as long as I expected it to.
kinds small for the breast size
Fell apart in the laundry! Warm while they lasted!
Shirt fita true to soze.  The headphones are HUGE.  Like size of my entire head for each ear piece
Suoer cute and got lots of compliments although the face started peeling off after 2 washings.
kinda plastic looking
Way shorter than it appears
The shirt will need to have another shirt worn underneath or you can see through it.
"I'm giving this 3 stars because these really run small. My 4.5 month old, who does not have overly large feet I don't think, was barely fitting into them. Many other posters have said that it would be helpful to provide a chart with inches, but it doesn't seem to be that the company checks these reviews, which is unfortunate. Many companies have staff that make adjustments based on customer reviews.

Otherwise, they are adorable booties. They would stay on the foot. I also bought a the warmer pairs, but Amazon had incorrectly marked them as 12 month, when they were actually 6 month. At the same time, I bought a $2.99 pair and a $4.99 pair of booties (the latter were very similar) and BOTH stay on the foot exactly the same. So although they material on the flannel ones seems slightly cheaper, the baby will grow out of them fast as anything. So you can pay for the stripes if you like, they are cute, but at least for the flannel ones, there are cheaper options."
Cheap walmart brand shirt with an iron on
"The style is nice,but quality of fabric and of work on it is cheap,like the dress was from Walmart:("
Very boyish style.  Sleeves are a bit too long and tight.  Not flattering.  Fabric is heavy and stiff.
"This is WAY too long, and it's much too tight and risque for daytime wear. What the model has on doesn't look super modest, but it also doesn't look too revealing. The neckline is too low, and the length of the sweater is ends mid-thigh for me. I am short (5 ft, 100-105 lbs, athletic build), so I don't think this looks very flattering on me. I look like a tart wearing this out, which is disappointing because other reviewers with pictures looked so good with this. Even though it fits tight, it still folds in some places (unflattering as it makes me look fatter but also very tarty at the same time) so I just look like a mess in this."
"The saying on the shirt made it hilarious,but only a very muscular built man could pull off wearing it,the laughs would affect an overweight wearer...."
"The fabric is a bit thick which can make you hot is summer .
i had to order a smaller size ."
"9 &1/2 to 10, seem a bit short, might stretch with usage, bet tight in the toes. 11 would be too big"
"They're comfortable but the previous reviewers are right, the straps are very clunky.  I wouldn't have gotten them but I needed white sandals and Dansko doesn't seem to make them anymore."
The buckle was broke when I got t hem and I didn't like that they were super baggy around the ankle area.  I opted to splurge for Hunter's.
Too small for my size 10.5 foot.
"the brand is great, except this is made for large tall women, not Petite women.. unless you are used to wearing Plus size bras.."
Plastic soles. Very slippery.
comparable to comfort cool x temp shirts not what i was looking for. seamed like it might be a good shirt but i cant deal with shrinking im too tall 100% polyyester for me only
"Really cute shirt, My son has only used it a couple times tho and it seems to have almost have a faded look. My son still loves it!"
Order larger size.
"This is my first pair of soccer cleats, so disclaimer... I do not have any others to compare them to. They are definitely narrow for me, which makes the laces short because it's uncomfortable to tighten them to the point that I have plenty of shoe lace. They do not feel like they have any support, and they're not wide enough to add an insert, but the material has done well in slightly muddy playing conditions, and they get the job done for a reasonable price."
"Passing these onto my Son's they are just too thin / cheap for a grown up professional to wear (practically see through).  The Wrinkle free shirts should have a * next to them.  They are more ""Slightly less wrinkled"" than non treated shirts.  I tried to save some money over more expensive shirts but in the end wasted money on this experiment."
I'm giving it 3 stars because the actual bangle is very thin compared to my other Alex and Ani bracelets. It feels like it will break very easily.
A very nice pair of pants. The fit was  good & I looked good
Very thin. light weight won't last
"Shoes are cute, color is nice pale gray. My issue are the elastic straps across the front. Though it creates a cute style, it ends up stopping circulation in my feet if I wear shoes all day."
I wear a size 4 to 6 and I ordered the small.  But it was too small to get zipped up all of the way.  I would have had to wear this with leggings or pants as it is very short as well.  To my it really wasn't what I was looking for.  I ended up buying the Cruel Seas Captain costume which fit great and looked much better.
These ran larger and hang on my son
"it seems like the clips are attached backwards.  at least, they are opposite from the strap adjuster, so either the clips go to the inside or the strap adjuster does.  it shouldn't be a problem but it annoyed my spouse, so I clipped the elastic and flipped the adjuster (much easier than flipping the clips).  Other than that, they work fine.  they don't set off normal metal detectors, but won't work on the new TSA full body scans, as the bulk still shows."
"It is very cute, but they are short. It looks really weird when i wear them."
the clip hurts the sides of the calf
"Ordered a 3X and was sent a Medium, returned but did not reorder. When washed following washing instructions to the tee, material did shrink, very disappointed!!"
Very very cheap. Threading holding it began to break apart within a couple months. I only had a few cards inside. But you get what you pay for
"My only disappointment:  after a few months of normal wear and washing, they become dingy.  Bleaching doesn't help too much."
Love the shirt but VERY huge & way too much extra matieral
Im a small in tops and I read chart and ordered a small. The top is short in the front and tight all around. Love the color though
A bit thin.  Let's see how they hold up this summer.  I will followup with an update come August.
Do not  rely on  the negative  comments to purchase this dress. Nice dress for the price.
"There was no mask in our package.  I have not found a mask like the one they show to replace it.  The shirt is fine, but I wish the rough Velcro was on the cape not the shirt."
"I really like the concept of this. They don't slip, they are comfortable and they don't show when I wear them with my shoes. The only thing I can complain about the size; it seems to squish my toes a bit like if they were curling backwards, which makes my feet sore at the end of the day. I feel like the sizes should be adjusted a bit and made bigger to fit the standard shoe size."
"I like these shoes, unfortunately, they are very cheaply made.  You get what you pay for!"
"I guess these shorts will wear well in rain- but the plastic feel of the material is a little annoying.  I would also recommend not getting the green color unless you are a dark skinned person as they really make lighter skinned individuals stand out.  Overall,  I think the shorts will last a long time, just not the most attractive article of clothing you might buy."
Little hard to use if you have a quick change but overall got the job done. Very stretchy and can role sometimes but otherwise they work pretty decent.
"I loved these when I first got them and ordered 5 pairs. They are very comfortable and fit well. I love the style. They are easy to move in. However, as someone else mentioned, if you have thicker thighs, they
will not last long. I just had my second pair tear on me, and the fabric is wearing thin on the others so I expect them to follow soon. I think they lasted me about 9 months. The first one I replaced with the same, but after the second one, I will start shopping other styles."
"Ok, so I LOVED THIS WATCH, up until yesterday, when the watch face, behind the protective glass got foggy, and eventually now has like condensation inside the glass. It was great for like 3 months, but now it's just unattractive, but it keeps ticking, so the mechanics are great, just something is off.

UPDATE: The condensation cleared up after about a month, and I still wear it and enjoy the simplicity. As time goes on, it does start ticking a bit slower and gets behind, so it has to be reset about once a month, and this did start to do this before the condensation issue.

UPDATE #2: About a year into the expedition with this watch, it stopped working completely, my guess it stems from the condensation issue."
"Comfy and affordable, but they do pill.  I'm able to keep them looking nice with a sweater stone."
"I'm 5'2, 110lbs and a 30D, this suit is massive on me. I ordered a small, their smallest size and I need to take it to the tailor. This fits me like a size large which is bad since it goes so low. But I love it and really want it,  so paying for the tailoring will be worth it. Shipping was super fast and well packaged so I'm leaving a 3 star instead of 1 star."
"These are supposed to be wide, and still are too narrow for my feet. It is so disappointing to have almost zero options for cute dancing shoes if you have wide feet."
"Very little stretch, fit my newborn (7lb, 8oz) for a day."
"I ordered these because they were on Oprah's favorite things list and I love thermal PJ's (I tend to toss and turn a lot at night and these tighter fitting PJs don't get twisted or tangled up).  However, the print on these are basically iron-on and a little scratchy, and the fit of the pants is awkward.  Definitely my least favorite pair of thermals and I wouldn't order again."
sleepery not wide enough
"I was choosing between these shirts and the ones from Old Navy for my job at Target. I already own one from Old Navy. I should've gone with the Old Navy ones since they're MUCH softer, these are made from heavy duty cotton and feel rigid. They're pretty baggy, and not fitted at all, definitely should have gotten a small. They're so long that they keep getting stuck in my PDA case at work. I'm 6' and weigh about 155 pounds. I wouldn't return them though, they're durable."
"Not like the old ones. Fit is very narrow. Order wides and a half-size larger than you normally do.

Update: After over 2 months of wearing these for outdoor work and hiking they show no sign of ""loosening  up"" to fit better. I still suggest you get the wider size. When I ordered these I got a 1/2 size larger but that doesn't help with width. The toe box is extremely narrow and even with light socks (You'll never fit heavy winter socks in these things.) my toes hurt at the end of the day."
very light and cheap appearing but ok for everyday wear
"Dress is very beautiful. I am 5-1"" and 110 lbs. the dress was too baggy around my chest area and way too long. If you're my size, do not buy this dress."
Can't tell if their even real Calvin's for this price but they fit well and are pretty cute.
the pin itself is very beautiful. it is vibrant and the colors are so nice. I sadly returned it because on the screen it looks like yellow white  orange black and teal. When it arrived it was all those colors and dark purple. some of the parts that look black are black and purple. i bought this to match a dress that was black orange yellow white and olive. With a dress that had so many colors my pin needed to be pretty spot on the purple was just too much for my dress. the blue is not an issue becuse it is so little but the purple is pretty dominant and just didn't look good with my dress so i returned it. The return was lightening quick and hassle free which i appreciated. I just wanted everyone to know about the purple. the pin is lovely but i was on a mission to get a pin that matched my dress. I picked on that was enamel but i really wanted rhinestone and was so excited when i saw this one. Too bad i couldn't see the purple on my screen because it is such a pretty pin.
sizes runs bigger than you think
I Like the thickness but they fit a little too snug.
"These are very nice shoes in concept, but not so much in execution.

At least 5 days per week for the entire day I wear slip-on Famolare Riva shoes.  I have worn these for probably 30 years; when they wear out I get them at Amazon or JCXXX or somewhere online.  Each shoe fits perfectly.

For about the same price, I bought these boat shoes for casual wear.  The right shoe is a good half size bigger than the left, despite saying they are the same size.  It is very loose and I haven't yet been able to pull the laces tight enough to make them work properly.  They may have to go back.

The overall build of the shoes is just sloppy and not what I would expect from Sperry and Amazon.  KMxxx does a better job at this.  The laces on both shoes were very misaligned.  By that I mean one side was about 4 times longer than the other, so that had to be pulled around.  This is just sloppy assembly.  The inside liner of one of the shoes had been folder at the arch by the carboard insert and now has a deep crease in the foam.  Again, sloppy assembly.  And the front top (above the instep) of one of the shoes either didn't get completely stained or has white marks on it.  That was the first thing my wife noticed.  Not impressive and terrible workmanship.

I foung these at FxxxxxFxxxxx at a shopping center for a few dollars more and they were perfect and fit perfect.  I should have just paid more and bought them there.

Maybe this is a fluke, but it sure isn't a good sign for Sperry or for Amazon to deliver a product like this."
"These shoes are really comfortable the first 10 minutes, but I feel like they squeeze my toes afterwards.  I've used them quite a few times now and haven't really broken into them and not sure if I ever will."
"These shoes are ok, I will have to take my time getting used to them though. Length and width were OK but the strap furthest back stands an inch or more higher than my foot so it makes for a sloppy walk.  I am a size 7 and that is what I bought."
"I like the fact that these slippers are boiled wool - which are the best kind - and that you can wear them outside because of the solid tennis shoe-like soles.  BUT, because the interior is like a tennis shoe, the slippers feel kind of clammy and cold - so not so cozy."
"Fits perfect and nice quality. I'm a mom of 2 littles and I can move in these like leggings. I can only
Give these 3 stars because they have weird buttons that stick out and catch on my shirt. It's annoying, but I still love them"
I would really love these shoes if the right shoe didn't have a defect. The fabric wasn't sewn in the proper form. I circled it in the picture attached.
"jeans are ok but like the Lee's better, they just fit me better"
"compared to the TOMS its really not bad, its well made and looks cute, BUT the ankle part is too high that it makes it uncomfortable to wear :( that is the only reason I returned it and gave it 3 stars. if your ok with the ankle, then its well worth the money :0)"
"Well made, just not what I needed."
The pant material is lightweight. It is more appropriate for summer rather than cooler weather. Carters onesies are heavier weight than these pants.
You get what you pay for. Pretty cheap and doesn't exactly fit well but worth a try.
"Super cute, but scratches very easily. It also turned my toe green, and had some sharp edges"
"Really nice looking bracelet, but one of the links broke withing two weeks of use. Gonna have to fix it."
"Supposed to be a wide shoe, but the toe box is very tight from top to bottom.  Had to return them.  Too bad...GREAT STYLE and COLOR!"
"I can see why I got this at a reduced price. I normally take a 7 or 7 1/2 in Clarks shoes. This was an 8 sandal.  It is just about wide enough and long enough for my foot. luckily.... I would not have been happy if it was any smaller, as I would have had to go through who knows what to return it. So be careful, if you take a true size 8, I doubt very much it will fit you."
"The pearls are definitely natural, as they have imperfections. The jade beads are okay, not as transparent as I would like. They are a pretty green color. I have a few quality jade bracelets and was not overly impressed by the jade in this bracelet, especially since it doesn't come with any certification (because they are beads, it is hard to tell if it is real jade--possibly just green jade-like stones). With certification for the quality of the jade, the price might be justified. The clasp is a good quality. This had some sticky grayish material on some of the beads as well, which comes off, but be aware that your bracelet may need some cleaning before you wear it the first time."
I didn't enjoy the design as much when i received it. Fit fairly well but not the best. Loose in some areas.
Tight in my toes
Zippers break easily.
Says cashmere but tag on robe states 100% polyester.  False advertising...  very soft and comfortable but be warned it is not cashmere at all.
"Cute, but not loving these. They fit a little bit big, but that is not the issue. The issue is that they are uncomfortable for any longer than an hour or two. I am wearing them primarily to take the dog out for potty breaks in the cold weather. Cannot wear them for running errands or going out for walks. I will keep them, but I wouldn't recommend them, honestly. Just not good for me."
"Pants fit true to size, coat is one size too small. We only needed the pants though so it was ok."
"I got these as undershirts. I got the XL but probably should have gotten large. The XL hangs too loose in the arm pit area, making it a little uncomfortable with another shirt on over it."
The fabric isn't that great and the socks are pretty busy.
A little shorter and wider than expected.
It fine
Cute but the sizing is very small
"Pros:
Very comfortable. Professional looking. Lightweight.

Cons:
I walk a LOT for work and what I've noticed (I bought two pairs of these shoes already) and they only last me maybe 6-8 months before the bottoms wear out so much that they begin to SLIP on wet payment. I don't know if this is repairable or not but once the bottoms wear down to a smooth bottom - you better not walk in the rain on smooth cement unless you want to take a quick seat."
Ran bigger than expected.  Way too big for my 8 year old.
"Not great, not terrible"
"Great quality shoe. Very poor at sizing. I would recommend a much better sizing chart. As usual, Amazon Prime took care of everything perfectly."
Good shoe except that my daughter complained about the sides of her feet hurting due to the design of the shoe.. she is wearing them with sock hoping it helps stretch it.
"... if you are into technology i guess you will enjoy it for a while... if you are a girl like me you will find out after some use that the watch is rather bulky for a thin wrist like mine. also.. i find it a bit inconvenient to have to click the side button to read the time. the time does not always show automatically when you pull your arm up and it is a bit impractical to have to be exaggerating the motion just to read the time... having said that, i guess i like the fact i can play with the camera, pick up calls and play with voice command... its cool for a while.... but if you are looking to just purchase a watch you will wear all the time, i would have to say this might not be what you are looking for."
NOT SO DURABLE SADLY.
I ordered these for my husband for a Cyclops costume. They are not even CLOSE to being able to fit him. These glasses are child-sized.
"I have owned this product for a while and for the most part it's held together well.  My biggest complaint are the leather tabs on the zippers, less than a month after I owned it one tore off.  A few months later the other followed.  I was concerned about the overall quality of the rest of the pocketbook but it seems to be holding together.  The outside does clean up nice but due to the leather tabs issue I wouldn't purchase again."
I were a medium in outter wear and even allowing for a thick sweater underneath it hung a bit too long for my liking.  I bunch it up when I use it.  So ample room all around.  It's a sweaters it's going to show the lint and Pell ball up on you
Uncomfortable and itchy.
"Don't know about  width...Could not get shoes on. Cute shoes, though."
"After reading the reviews, I ordered XL, I usually wear size M or L in women depending on the brands. My bust is 36C. Arrived when expected, quality is nice, but too small. I end up giving to my daughter who wears a size 5. Very disappointed in the size, wished it would have fitted."
"This is a nice shoe, but slips when I walk.  Otherwise, comfortable."
"These are ok for Zumba but I won't give them a 5 star rating. They look good. The sole is good, thin and easy to pivot on. Arch support is minimal but what I would expect from such a low profile shoe. This shoe can fit a wide foot (my feet are borderline wide)because it's entirely a fabric upper and stretches with little wear. This, however, is where the problem lies. Being fabric, it gives little lateral support. If your zumba instructor likes a lot of lateral movement, you may feel like the shoe gets sloppy. I will lace up my shoes tight before class but half way through I feel like I'm about to slide of off the sole in lateral moves. I can tell by the way the shoe is constructed that it's probably not going to last a long time."
"Full cut in some respects but the ""pouch"" is a bit small and narrow.  I don't think I would buy them again."
"Quality looks fine, but it's HUGE! I purchased size 0-3months, and it looks like 12months+! It was so inexpensive, I'm just gonna hang onto it, but it's a bummer the sizing is SO off, because I was really
hoping to use it now. I attached a photo of a typical size 0-3month onesie on top of the shirt purchased; notice the massive difference in sleeve and overall size!"
"Fits but stiff, will give u a blister  but just needs to be broken in"
I love nine west shoes but I'm not thrilled with this pair.  They are narrow and the material is cheap.  I've only worn them a couple of times since I purchased them.
"These were good when I bought them, but after washing, they seem somewhat tighter.  Did not put them in the dryer, either."
"kind of cheap. at one point there's the tip of a nail sticking out, and the corners aren't fully covered with the ""leather look"" tape stuff. it's exactly what i was looking for, but cheaply made, and i double it will hold up for a long time."
This is OK but does not have the quality that I have come to expect with Columbia belts.
"Cute
Daily Prime shopper
Mary kechejian"
Nice but not for me
Larger then expected.
"The one BIG issue I ha with these shoes is that ONE was brand new but the other was used / worn / visibly damaged. If they were both brand new, easy 5 stars. Beware."
"I like the style and support these shoes offer.  However, they are a little narrow.  After wearing them a few times, the leather seemed to have stretched a bit and they are more comfortable.  I'm a little disappointed with the quality of the stitching."
"This was one of my first CowCow dress and I was so excited for it to be delivered!

The good:
 The print was exactly as it's shown in the product images. Be sure to note that the description says *BLUE*, and it is...very light, sky blue... even though the pictures makes it appear to be a white background.
 It's a fit and flare dress so I expected it to *fit* in the bust and upper part of the torso before *flaring* out starting at the top of the waist and continuing on down. My bra size is a 44H and I typically wear a women's size 24 in dresses and the 3X was a bit snug across the bust, but not unacceptably so.
 The Lycra fabric gives it that stretch without bagging and provides a great weight for most seasons (could feel clingy in hot weather).

The not so good:
 The cap sleeves are incredibly tight. My upper arms are quite fat and and the cut of the sleeves posed problematic for me. The sleeves are meant to hit just a couple of inches down from your shoulder and are cut so the opening has a circumference of about 12.5 inches. The seaming to finish the cuffs prevents the material from stretching to it's capacity, making the sleeves much too tight for me.
 This style seems to be cut smaller than the ""Short Sleeved"" and ""Sleeveless"" dress styles by CowCow. It stretched well enough to fit; however, across the bust the overall print appeared lighter because of the stretch.

The bottom line:
I love the dress, so I may see if I can tailor the sleeves in some way, or cut/hem them to make it a sleeveless dress. In the future, if I wish to order another CowCow dress, I will make sure it's one of their ""Sleeveless"" styles! On a side note, I also purchased one of their dresses in the ""Short Sleeve"" fit, and it's the same issue of being too tight in the arm opening."
"A lot smaller than expected. If you are looking at this for school, I recommend to look for something bigger. The height is great, but the width is too small. It doesn't stretch out far enough to hold textbooks, folders, and anything else you need, all at once. This backpack would be great for non-school use!"
"The black leather still looks brown; it goes better with a brown ensemble than a black. 3 stars rather than 5 for coloring.

otherwise the shoes are a superb fit and very comfortable."
"Since I wear an 8 1/2, I took a chance ordering the European size 38, which is 8-8 1/2.  Unfortunately, they were too tight.  I'd consider reordering a 39, but I noticed that the strap may be too low on my high arch bone.  Glad I have free returns."
"Super cute shoe but my foot just didn't work with the hard strap in front.  Also, the top strap of shoe is not adjustable so wasn't able to fit properly."
"It's okay. Not something I would buy in person at the mall or store.
 The sleeves are a bit long. It looks better in the photo than it does in person.

Took a long time to receive."
"The chest folds and touches baby mouth and then, baby seems to be stimulated to eat "
These are so long its ridiculous. Just because someone is a 3X does not make them 8 feet tall. Total bummer.
"I was really looking forward to these as they used to be my favorite sandals years ago.  I'm not sure if my foot has just changed, but I wear a medium width in all my shoes and this one was just a little too narrow to be comfortable.  Had to return them."
"It is cute, and it lays well. Sadly, I ordered an XL, and they sent an L, and the minute I pulled it out of the wrapper, the gold button fell off. Not sure that it was ever even sewed on."
Worked great for a few days. Velcro is now unraveling and I cant close bag.
did not fit well at all.  i had toreturn it.
"I like these belts, and I like that they come in larger sizes. I ordered the red for a little flare, but am disappointed that the color is coming off, only where the buckle touches, after a few wears."
"Unfortunately, this ring did not meet my expectations. While it is beautiful, it is probably about half a size smaller than advertised and it turned my finger green, so it's probably not pure sterling silver. It's gorgeous and will be nice for short term wear, but not for the daily use like I had been hoping."
"It warms and dries sweaty shoes as it is supposed to do. It really needs to come with an on/off switch on it though. For $40, there is not much to it and I'm sure it  could be sold cheaper."
My son loved these shoes he wears them every day although the material on the top of the toes has begun to peel off.
"These shoes are cute and the leather is super soft but I don't like how they look on my BIG foot! I think they would look much cuter in a smaller size. Oh well, you can't win them all!"
"The tank tops seem to be good quality.  I ordered a large, and I typically fall between a medium and a large in sizing.  These fit, but they were skin tight.  They weren't so tight that skin was bulging over the top.  I prefer my tank tops to have a little bit of breathing room, so I am returning them"
"The fit is fine, what is disappointing is this is the 2nd pair of these I have gotten as they are great to stand on all day, but this particular pair has the bottom of the shoe peeling off.  They are SO comfortable and this is SO disappointing !!  The first pair I bought 2 years ago I had zero issues with and just loved them.  I am a massage therapist so these are great for being on my feet all day, but that they are damaged or not made as well as my first pair is frustrating."
Should have bought a size bigger.
"Nice product but it bleeds and mine came with a dark green strip down the center.  The included photo is after a fifth cold water, one hour soak."
Dose not look like the picture
"Nice and soft, true to fit. However, the padding is almost flat and I've only had them for about two months."
"I purchased these shoes for everyday use, not for running, and they are great.  These shoes are extremely flexible, allowing your foot to work the way it has evolved to.  The sole's cushioning is excellent and the upper is soft.  The man-made suede of the upper appears to be easy to clean; just an old toothbrush should be needed.  If that's not good enough, a bit of water should help too.  I can't really speak to how long they last, as I've worn them only three days.

UPDATE: I've had these shoes for awhile now and have lowered my review from 5 to 3 stars.  This is because the large difference in thickness between the shoe's heel and forefoot is so large too much weight is shifted onto the ball of the wearer's foot.  I found that the ball of my foot, especially where my toes attach, would become sore after only a few hours in this shoe.  A flatter profile would more evenly distribute the wearer's weight and avoid this issue.  These shoes have largely been retired and are used only when I don't anticipate being on my feet much."
"For the price, I will keep these shoes and wear them for shorter walks.  They are very comfortable, but the length of the shoe is a little short for my size (8.5).  My big toe is right on the edge of the shoe front; no real wiggle room.  Thinner socks are a must."
Seems a little undersized order the next size up from your normal size
"Its okay, not very stylish and very slippery to wear. Looks nicer in the picture."
Runs way to small.  Buy a size or 2 up.  Other than that it is pretty.  I'll give it away...
"These shoes did not fit as expected. Everyone said to buy a size smaller. I bought a half size smaller, and the shoes were then too small. I had to wear them anyways because we were leaving for the beach the next day. The shoes did not keep the sand out of the shoes, so I was constantly having to dump wet sand out of the shoes. they were fairly comfortable but don't seem any different than any other cheap water shoe I have worn."
The dress looks nothing like the picture. It's pure white instead of ivory white. Luckily the dress still fits and look great. But still disappointed!
"They are slim looking sneakers with a week-padded heel but not so much at the ball of your feet. A size 8 is a smidge snug but stretched after a few weeks of constant use. However, if you're not willing to deal with the discomfort, get an 8-1/2."
need inserts in them to help with the fit and also make more comfortable.  They are also a little wide from the ankle on up.
Purchased as a gift. Nice but leather very hard.
"So, on the packaging it says it could be men's underwear?

Anyway, there would be no room at all. I wear a size 0 and got the small (only size available when I ordered) - I EASILY could have been much more comfortable in a medium. It fit but the elastic by the thighs was a little tight - the rest of the material fit comfortably though."
It fit like a glove but not tight enough for me.
Cute looking shoes but way too big and I ordered a size up based on reviews. Had to return.
They fit my calf well . Definitely not the most comfy boots in the world but I received a lot of compliments on them when I wore them out
"Not a high end dress, but price reflects that.  Back seam was open in a five inch gap.  I stiched it myself.  Dress size medium was very tight, (I'm an 8) I'd order a size up."
"these were beautiful boots but no way were they large calf. My petite daughter even had trouble zipping them over her calf.
It cost me $12 to return them so I was very unhappy."
"Runs very small and very thin material, you can see through it. Its a very thin cotton.  I got it to wear under something, so it will work for that purpose, but I would wear it by itself."
"Runs small.  I am 5'3"" and 120 lbs. and I normally wear a XS-S.  I got this top in a small but should have gotten a medium! It is tight everywhere. I could live with it but I was afraid that it might shrink after wash since it's cotton. The material is very thin too. Check out the size chart before ordering! I should have gotten a M. I unfortunately had to return it."
"T-shirt is made of  a nice comfortable quality however the shirt is too short. It stops right at my belt line, meaning if I raise my hand even the slightest it will look like a belly shirt which was not as described. Not worth the money shipping back. Money down the drain."
"My fault for not realizing there was not an adjustable waist.  Sadly my son tried on the ones that did and tore off all the tags so now I will be trying to figure out how to make these usable.
BUT dickies pants are incredibly sturdy and some what indestructible."
"Beautiful,disappointed with the size, did not received the size I ordered. Received a size 9 instead of a size 11"
"The material wasn't as cheap as the other reviews explained, but I wouldn't list this as a one size fits all.... it almost didn't go over my hips...... I would considered this a size 8 with very little stretch. Overall I'm satisfied!"
I love the style and it fit me everywhere except across my chest which made me very disappointed
Two of my shirts have small holes in them.
"The stitching is a little suspect. And the card pull tab doesn't stay accessible,or in ""outward"" position, i.e., it folds into itself (might be defect), causing me to have to ""dig"" for credit cards creating an embarrassing payment event.  The color is nice and feels soft and of good quality, but I don't believe it will hold up for the long run. I'll be looking for something a bit more rugged for this price point."
".. as good as Uggs? NOT ! Even though they are great and I did pick the correct size... they flop up and down on the heels.
No, Uggs do not do this, they stay put on the heel, so now I know there is a difference, and it is not just the price !"
"Disappointed.  It's a nice bag, with lots of great pockets, BUT the zipper quit on the big pocket one month before school ends.  I was hoping it would at least last through summer camp."
"Need one size longer. Fits to the upper thigh, not the best look for modesty. I am 6'3. Recommend getting a size bigger."
Bought these for a costume so I got the same pit in red and black...the black fit perfectly but the red ones are a bit narrow
"Loved the idea of this swimsuit, I recently gave birth, so I have a stomach I didn't have last summer, so I needed a new swimming suit. Found this and read the reviews. Everyone says it fits small so order bigger. Makes sense. The measurement chart is quite accurate so don't order your ""size"", measure!
The other thing people were saying was the bust was huge, I was like ""Finally!"" I am a 38 G, so finding a one piece that fits correctly is Hard! I ordered a 4X just in case.
The shipping took around  20 days, and the tracking # they gave me was useless. Never showed any progress, just that the shipping # had be created.
Finally received it and tried it on. No underwire like some of the other reviews said it had. Technically it fits, the body is big, but I can easily take that in. I knew that going in because of the measurements. The Bust is not as large as the reviewers would have you believe if you are a large busted lady. Yes it fits, somewhat, but it shows A LOT! The built-in bra isn't even as big as the purple section of the swimming suit. Thinking of cutting it out and adding one of my older bras instead"
Much larger than expected.  Had to put a lining in it.  Other than that.  It is a nice hat.
"I've had better socks. These wear or quickly, and get a bit stretched. They also turn upside down on me so that not only are they uncomfortable, but the dirty part is on top of my foot. This can be embarrassing."
"I love the boots except they smell like stinky toxic rubber from China. I'm trying to air them out but I'm not sure the smell is ever going to completely go away.

I ordered a 1/2 size larger than I usually wear because of the reviews I had read. They fit fine. it was a good choice to do that."
"Super stretchy.  More of a Jegging than a jean.  I am not a fan of stretchy other people may love them.  Also not a lot of room in the bum, for me if they WEREN'T stretchy my bum would be hanging out if i squat or bend.  Because of the stretch maybe order a size smaller and after wearing for 20 mins they will be falling off."
She's worn them 2weeks and they are so worn looking already. so disappointing.
The straps are too short for me so it rides up. The cotton is comfortable.
"Beautiful heels but not comfy it's too tight in front hurst my toes, I bought 2 pairs in different colors and I just had chance to wear it after a year I don't think I can return it anymore... "
The watch works great but the placement of the world is weird :/ should have paid more attention to the photo.
"Very cute dress but a bit short for a maxi. I am 5""2 and it comes to about an inch above my ankle. I am going to shorten it to make it more of a knee length dress because it is super adorable and I want to make it work! Once I shorten the dress it will be great to throw on an go!"
"The dress is beautiful, but runs really small.  My daughter wears a 20.  I ordered a 24 and the panel in the back was not big enough.  I had it altered to make the panel larger."
".. I'm not crazy about how they fit. Tight around my bottom, and loose around my hips. I had to order a size up so that it wouldn't be too tight in the one area. Maybe it would fit better if I had a flat bottom, but I don't. So, if you're curvy like me, beware of the sizing issue.
Good quality material."
I've had these for two weeks now and they're already coming apart after a second wear. I followed the care instructions to the T as well. The lace under the belly also cuts in a tad and is very uncomfortable. I'd recommend getting two sizes bigger than your pre pregnancy size. I got a large thinking one size up would be fine like other brands but not with this one.
"The length was kind of short. My height is 5'2"", so this suprised me."
"Nice shoe, just didn't fit me well.  Unusual because usually Clarks are perfect for me."
"Straps were not attached. They were not broken, just not attached, no where to clip, had to pay someone to sew them on there...... It was still a good deal for 36F bra and would have costed more to pay shipping to exchange for one put together the right way so I dealt with it myself."
"It was a beautiful necklace, just not large enough."
"Small is teeny tiny. For like, a size US 2-4 I would say. I had to send back. Im a 6. I usually buy small in leggings. Also, the material is shiny. Much better if it was matte. I gave them to someone else who was very happy with them."
"I loved this suitcase at first. So easy to spot at the airport, and packing was comfortable. However, I recently used it for the 4th of 5th time and one of the wheels came off and cracked the suitcase :-("
This dress pattern is very flattering and it falls nicely.  The problem is with the fabric used.  It wasn't an expensive dress and unfortunately you can tell.  The fabric is a very cheap looking polyester and it has a strong chemically smell.  I washed it twice already and can't get rid of the smell...
"But didn't like the fabric material, not a soft type."
"Cute, but not something to use as a costume on its own. The ""bones"" are there. I made my own alterations and additions to it, and it turned out great. But it's not spectacular right out of the package. And it's definitely a costume--some mashup of pirate-victorian-steampunk-misc on its own."
The planted bra has molded cups and I really don't like the cups.  Otherwise the bra would be comfortable.  I would buy another Playtex bra with soft cups.
"They fit great and aren't too thin but they do seem to be wearing out very quickly wear thighs rub. I've gotten 3 months of use, working out no more than 2-3 times a week."
One wash and it will not fit!!!
Cute fall/spring jacket. I ordered a size up from what I usually wear and it was tight but it zipped. I guess it's one of those jackets that I'll have to leave unzipped when I wear it. Looks like the picture. I suggest ordering 2 sizes up from what you usually wear. Disappointed it's tight.
"I normally wear an XL, but I got an XXL and these are still snug. But I'm always excited to find superhero underwear for someone my age."
"I ordered a 3x, thinking I would wear a cami underneath if it was too oversized, as I am usually a 1x or 2x.  This 3x was supposed to fit someone who is a 24/26, per the item description, so this was not a case of having unwittingly ordered a junior plus.  I am wearing an 18 jeans and a 20 top right now, and this thing fits like wallpaper.  It's so, so cute, and the price was great, but a deal is only good if you've a need for the item - I've no need for a top that fits my best friend perfectly. She is a size 14, 16 on a ""fat day"".

Will not order from this company, again, unfortunately, as they are not posting accurate sizing information."
Elasticity does not last.
"The suit was long and the head was TIGHT! I ordered the white one because my child insisted on being ""nothing"" for Halloween and had to have the white. BAD idea! The suit was gray by the end of the day and will not come clean. The white is also very see through as the material is thin! I paid WAY too much for what I got. Wouldn't purchase again."
"Pretty good and comfy, the sizing was way too big for a size large."
A little too tight and material is way too thin
comfy. the side strings make it easier for the corset to bend upwards on a big girl like me whenever I sit down. Hooks in front feel cheap and are a bitch to get in the hole started ti peel the coatings on the hooks as well
Seems like it's just a lot of fabric. Gets pretty warm. The fit is fine and it is pretty comfortable except for the noted issues.
The crystals on the earrings that I received were not clear as shown but rather had a yellow cast.  I did not return them and have actually worn them a couple of times.  They are not as pretty as some of the crystal earrings I have purchased but I have seen worse.
"For some reason, I believe I received an off brand that was not Donna Karan. I purchased my first pair of Donna Karan tights directly from Nordstrom, and had great success. Was able to wear 5-6 times with no runs, but eventually they began to look a little threadbare. When I ordered these, I felt that the quality of the material was different, and that they got a run rather quickly. The tag on them said ""Nordstrom,"" not Donna Karan.

I'm not sure if I just purchased a different style, than what I had originally wanted, but I don't believe these tights were the right product. In general, Donna Karan Signature Sheer Hosiery is amazing, and feels great on your legs. They last many wears as well. I did not have the same experience with the tights I received from Amazon."
Beautiful watch but can't wear not instruction if possible to shorten. To bad cause I really would have loved this watch if I could wear it.
"My son is 8, wears a size 7x or 8 in clothing and is very much an average size for his age. The pants were long, just as as I'd intended.. room to grow.  The shirt, however, is short. I'm always seeing his tummy.  Disappointing because the only option would then be to get the next size up and getting an 11/12 for an 8 year old is a bit much."
A little too slick...
The hardware is much too shiny for me. And the material is too stiff. But the size and price is right and it has a shoulder strap. Traveling and wanted something that wasn't too pricey.
They look good but I had to return bc too small.
"I ordered a size 6.5 because that is my size, they felt like a size 6.  I do love the look so instead of returning them I sold them to my friend.  Great for the price at $39. lightning price.  When I went to order a bigger size they were priced higher so I will wait for them to go on sale again."
"Kind of small. I wear a model-size US 4, and this is somewhat smaller than it should be - except the sleeves, which stick up ridiculously. The length I'd good on me at 5'10"" (at the knee). If in doubt, order larger."
"I really wanted to love these clogs.  I needed a pair of slip-ons to wear on my ever expanding feet in the final stages of pregnancy.  I was hoping that these would work.  I think that my expectations might have been a bit misplaced.

Pros:
- Very cozy
- Good for indoor
- Made for narrow feet

Cons:
- Foot opening is a bit drafty (not great for outdoor use)
- If worn outdoors, it will let in snow
- A bit snug
- Could use some more arch support"
The materail was thinner and cheaper than I had expected.  It runs small so when it streteches that much it become see through. I kept it as something to hang out in around the house but will not be wearing it out. It is way smaller than I expected. I am medium but bought in large and still too small.
"A little less than anticipated, but they work."
I have very small feet size 6 so for these to be tight on my feet should tell you how small they are. They don't feel like real wool either. They feel very thin. I hope that helps someone.
"The dress was just put into a plastic bag, and when I opened I saw it was definitely going to fit way too big (order a size down, maybe 2 if you want a ""tight, fitted"" look). It was a somewhat thin material, similar to a nightgown. Or club wear type dress, but doesn't have the club wear look once it's on. However, that being said, it is very comfy (definitely wear in warmer weather). I tried it on and it just wasn't my thing (too long for me, but that's my fault for not paying attention to all of the ad, which said it was mid calf length), but I may be able to make it work with a blazer and wear to work or for a meeting, something conservative. So yes, ladies, it is a good wear to work dress and maybe even a from office to happy hour type dress. I may give them a try again and order a size or 2 down.
I am glad I had the chance to buy and review, and do not regret the purchase, just not as excited as I thought I would be.
Disclaimer: I received this item at a discount from the seller for my honest/unbiased review."
Nice....but run small
Pilled really easily. Comfortable though. Pretty warm.
"This is a nice suit, well made and true to the colors shown. That said, I ordered a 14 when I should probably have gotten a 12, it was very big on me and not as flowy in the front as I expected. The suit clung to all the wrong places. I am returning it."
"I bought this Anna dress (2-3 years)  for my 2.5 year old who's 38"" and almost 30lbs.  The size is just right (no room to grow).  Not all the way to the ground which is perfect for trick or treating.  It was a fight to get my daughter in this dress (it's scratch/itchy).  We put on tights and pulled them all the way up to her underarms and putting it on was much easier.  The fabrics look adorable on the outside.  The inside is quickly done - ok for a costume but the middle seam flips the other way and makes it look like a pregnant toddler Anna costume.  I will have to fix it somehow.
It did arrive quickly and my daughter loved dancing around in it.  Fabric looks pretty."
"Good looking piece of luggage - color is more bright orange than dull like the picture - but a good thing because it's easy to pick out of the usual black luggages. However, was very frustrating as it is not balanced properly - kept tipping over! I did not have anything unusually heavy nor did I have it over packed. Nothing in the two front pockets either - but it continually kept tipping over every time I stopped pulling it and tried to have it stand up - it tipped over. Not something I would buy again as it was very annoying and inconvenient when boarding a plane!!!"
It was a beautiful dress but my arms did not fit in the arm holes.
I'm a size 8 and saw these on my friend who is a size 9 and has a wider foot than me and they looked adorable...prompting me to purchase a pair of my own. Have yet to wear them! They look very awkward on my foot since the top leather part doesn't come up high enough. I think these look way cuter on smaller or wider feet given the leather wrap placement. Very comfortable though. (And yes I tried it with jeans and even that didn't work fml)
"I love the look but I think it was too small for my 1yr old boy. We tried it on his feet but it was not fitting him correctly, I think the height between his arch (bottom of foot) and the top of his foot is too tall? It seemed like we couldn't get past that point. I think we got them on him once."
ordered wrong color but kept anyway
"The socks are very nice, but I wear a size 7 and these are several inches too long. Either the heel will sit on my calf and the top of the sock is way above knee, or I have to take the 3-4 slack inches and pull it under and tuck under my toes. Very, very large."
"OK for a teenage punk rocker I guess. Didn't fit very well, but will probably stretch a bit."
doesnt fit as well as some of my others
"You get what you pay for - and quality this is not. Thought I would go crazy trying to get the battery into position - but succeeded after reading some more experienced users tip on what to do (the booklet is not informative). It was so bad I considered if I would really change the battery when the existing one runs out. However, afterwards it does what it should do; you can weigh your luggage and avoid panic at the check-in counter when the friendly lady says one of your pieces is  lb too heavy and proceeds to charge you 50$ for your overweight luggage... Seems to correct so far. Be aware that you need to be strong enough to lift your luggage and hold it steady to check the weight. Works best when there is someone to help you read the scale."
The glassed were adorable but you get what you pay for. The attached decorations wouldn't stand up and the retirement sign had to be taped on. Also I bought these for a male and they really are geared towards a female.
felt so good when I first put it on BUT the bottom hooks digs into the skin and is very annoying. will need to put something there to prevent it.
"It was a little tight across the  chest, even though I went up a size. I was hoping that the tab could be secured under the collar when not in use, but that was not the case. For me, I though it looked weird just hanging down like that. It looked great when you had the collar up. I returned it."
The subject is tiny and the chain looks cheap. Very disappointed.
Meh.  too expensive
No give but fits as expected. Not for someone with large chests as the material will smash them
Holds up pants.  Cheaply made for a cheap price.
The watch works great. If you are looking for a nice watch to wear to work I would keep looking.  I am always in search of a nice looking digital watch but Casio let me down.
"i ordered the c/d, it was much larger than expected, so i returned. may try to order the smaller size and see how that works."
Its an ok watch for the price i wear it to work an nowhere else
"I like it because I can carry my I Pad in it, but the decorations are starting to come off."
"Love the fit and they are very comfortable.  I have a pair of the unlined which I love.  I did not realize these were fleece lined when I ordered them so had to return them.
Since I live in Florida I don't have much use for that type of product!  LOL
Will continue to look for the unlined product and order another pair."
Nice tights but I wish I wouldve ordered a small.
"i'm 5.9 tall and weight 150 lb usually wears us medium on tops and 32 in pants.

i ordered medium from this shirt.

what i like:
the printing quality and the fabric quality is really high,
color doesn't fade with washing,
material doesn't shrink with washing.

what i don't like:
the fitting is large by one size at least.
the sleeve area is very wide on the arms
fitting not slim or tied, its really wide
its very tied around the neck."
They shrink but can still be worn.
the volume of the hair is thin
These are great for the price! While the material is thick and feels sturdy at first it doesn't have much bounce back. Meaning once it stretches to go over a larger area it doesn't suck back in leading to a slightly baggy feel. I went according to the size chart. Maybe if I sized down it would be better at holding its form.
"The craftsmanship on this pair of Bates boots is not on par with the pair they're replacing (same manufacturer, same style, same size).  The lace is too skinny for a boot lace, and the velcro flap that goes over the zipper keeps popping open because it's too short.  I wear my Bates when out on the motorcycle, so the velcro flap popping open is a serious issue when I come to a stop and need to put a foot down quickly without catching the pant leg or velcro strap on anything.  Other than that they're a good, lightweight pair of boots."
My problem is with the model on this product page!  Can you find an actual plus size model please?
"It's not cotton, it's 60/40 with poly. Looks nice."
"Very thin material, slightly see-through when bending down"
Very thin fabric.  You get what you pay for.  Decent construction and will look fine under other shirts for fall wear.  Not bad for the price.  Get the XL if you're a 42 jacket size.
"Cute but very inexpensive looking. The stones look nice but the chain is so fine, one tug and it will break. The charm is very tiny so I assume the necklace more appropriate for a child, definitely not an adult. I know it's described as a hashtag but it could easily be seen as tic-tac-toe.  I think there are better choices out there, this is not one of my favorite."
"Bought two pairs of Crocs, different styles but same size. This pair is narrower than the other... Would like to see size consistency across all styles."
Thought it would be longer but runs short.
I am not able to remove my driver's license except with pliers.
"We loved the look and thought they would be great for fall and early winter. Not so much, they are not warm and they do run large. We returned them and went with uggs boo bootie. I will probably order another pair next summer."
"Cheap fabric, almost see through, and the pink color is very baby girl pink.  The off the shoulder part does fit better than most shirts of this style, but I had some problems with the elastic band around the bottom of the shirt."
"I normally wear a size 12 in everything, but this was a little snug.
Nice costume for 1 night, but will fray and fall apart after walking around for a bit. I wore it to Disney's halloween party and by the first couple hours, I was tripping over loose threads at the bottom of the skirt."
I couldn't believe these socks were for 6-8 yr olds. they look more like toddler socks. quality and colors seem fine otherwise. BUY LARGE!!!
Weird fit -- ok in front but horrid in back.  Shows every bulge and ....
"Cute socks, but a bit cheap looking. Face looks as if it will wash off after a few washings."
Looks a lot like fish net.
"I purchased this product to use as a foundation for a Renaissance gown. I was interested because it was advertised as having ""Spiral Steel Boned Waist"" so I was expecting a titan of a waist cincher. This product is flimsy and not any more advanced than the regular boning found in other type products. I will still use this product as the addition of the arm straps will give the Renaissance costume a little more structure but I do not see myself trying to use to tame the belly fat because it just isn't tough enough to risk trying under a skinny dress. I think as this type of product goes it is average in quality and performance, no magic hourglass figure here, not going to take a couple sizes off for that special date or that 20 year class reunion, but possibly worth a try for a smooth silhouette under a dress that fits well that needs a clean line. Or for a costume that needs some structure without all the sewing hassel."
"Pretty but too big, I gave them away, and the person I gave them to loved them"
Very thin. Light and flowy
Not as detailed as pictured but it's exactly what you'd expect for the price. I wish they'd do an extra line of mesh so the designs aren't so easily outlined. It's basically just mesh on mesh.
I love the silhouette that a good fitting corset gives my torso. I figured I would order this one and give my latex corset a break. I hate how cheap and thin these little satin strings are that come with it.
not the greatest. these are cute but i still get the starbursts and ghosting with extremely bright lights.  but they do block out a majority of the brightness
"I'm 5'11"", 175lbs, 32 waist and ordered the medium. the length is fine but it's very very baggy. think like most clothing in the US, meant for the ""average"" person so there's plenty of room for child bearing hips. the material is incredibly soft and comfortable and the pattern looks better in person. overall, like my purchase."
"Love PaatyBoutik design, but wish for the price, they made their clothing with better material.  There's just something odd about the material they use.  Maybe cotton than they currently are using.  All and all, this is a cute style, but it runs a bit small.  Material quality lacks for price point.  Have black in several of her tops and they all are lint trappers.  Not good!  Thus, be careful with black as you need to carry a lint roller."
"The sizing ran a little small. The fabric was not very soft and caused a lot of chaffing around the neck, ouch!  It was being used for a costume and only the collar area was showing so it did it's job.  It was inexpensive so I guess I got what I paid for."
Ordered the same size I was actually wearing that day and they were too short and too small. Other reviewers were saying the length was good while they stated they were 2-3 inches taller than me! I'm hesitant to order the Long .....
fit was fine but it was way shorter then expected. pretty much just a long shirt.
The color of the stones were darker than the picture and just were not as bright as I had hoped so I sent them back.
"Nice sandals, seemed to be good quality, just short and narrow.  Disappointed because they have some cool products.  I'd order at least a half size maybe even a full size over."
"Straps fall, it might just be my boobs"
"I like that fact that this shirt is somewhat large, that's how I like it.  Nevertheless even though the pictures of blue spruce tee shirts may show different shades they are exactly the same colour, so this is the mistake I made.  The Shirts are also somewhat thin.  So if you don't like thin shirts don't buy online because you wouldn't know what you are getting."
"I thought the people saying the wig was brown and not blonde were ordering the very light blonde wig. I needed a more strawberry blonde looking wig as in the photo shown on the Brown option.

The wig I hot is nice for a cheaper wig buy it is not either of the colors pictured. It's more brown like Margaery Tyrella from Game of Thrones and would be good for her. Definitely not Lily James' Cinderella. Luckily my friend needed a brown wig anyway.

Seller needs to update photos."
Nice but more like sweater material then cotton.
cute but short footed
Didn't really cool much.
only this color (out of 5 ordered) shrunk
"Great color and style, however, the 9.5 was almost an inch too long and wide.  I hate using the pads to make the shoe smaller and the size 9 is almost double in price.  Sadly, these are going back..."
They look pretty but feel cheap
"These shoes were pretty high for a support shoe and I am used to high heels but think this one might be pushing it for me since I plan on walking and standing in them most of the day. The main reason I am returning them however is that the toe area was too tight and cut into the top of my foot directly below my large toe. I did not have the problem with cutting into the ankle as others have stated. The right shoe was definitely worse than the left but after only about 5 or 10 minutes of walking around my house, the shoes left a huge welt on my right foot and a medium sized welt on the left. I don't think it's the construction of the shoe so much as the way my feet are.  One thing I really loved about this shoe is the Slate color - kinda brown, kind grey so it would look great with a blacks, greys, brown, etc.  Would be great with Navy where black is too severe."
decent fit for the price
"Works for short period of time.  Ashame that it doesn't properly fit fuller breast size.
Also, if wearing a light weight fabric, top seam will show - it's not seamless
Good for Body Con dresses made of thicker fabric as it is backless and will hold in place longer"
Great cotton but smaller.
Sized on the smaller side. Fabric not as expected. Would like the product much more if it was silk.
This did not fit and I had to give it away in stead.
not what I expected and too small
little tight dut nice
i like but not that much
"I'd say I have to agree with other reviwers that the sizing is way off for these. This was suppose to fit maybe-snug for my build, but the crazy thing is it fit my wife better and was almost too small for her...she's 5'3"" and slim!! I would buy again but it must be at least 2 sizes larger than they claim to fit me. Mildly disappointed."
"HUGE logo on the front, misleading pic."
"Really limits you as to how much you can out in this (which might really not be such a bad thing).  I wanted to carry cash in it, as well as credit cards but was not able, so I limit myself to 2 cards and just a few bills.  Can't vouch for the protection factor, probably ill never know - unless someone DOES get my #"
The shorts are great but way too small order two sizes up for comfort I'm normally a 3 or 5 depending on brand. I had to send the 5 back and get a 7 and to be honest a 9 would have been even better
The shoes are really cute.  The fit was fine but the heel was a little higher than I expected.  I wouldnt plan to go partying in them unless you are really use to a heel this high.
"I got this for my great-neice. it was larger than expected, but she leans toward the skinny side. Color is nice, but wish the material was a bit thicker. OK"
Works for me. I bought these as a light weight general purpose athletic shoe for walking around in summer. Something inexpensive that I didn't care if they got muddy or dirty. I don't use them for running or other athletic activities ( other shoes for that). They have held up well for what I intended them for.
"I have slightly wide feet and if you do too, I do not suggest these shoes. I usually don't run into that problem, however, I did with these."
"This is a cute wallet. Its not as bright as the picture but it is purple. mine is no where near burgundy or brown and it smells fine.  What I really like is that is it a long wallet, its not the average size wallet, its a little shorter than a letter size envelope. The reason I gave it 3 stars was because it says its a checkbook wallet but does not come with a checkbook holder.  I just used the holder from my previous wallet. What you see in the picture is just what you get. Also it doesn't snap its a magnetic close. But thats ok, as long as it stays close."
adorable. fun around the house socks.
"for some reason Demonia shoes tent to be weird in the toes, your toes smash up but the rest of shoes fit well. I even bought a size bigger because I have had this problem with other pair..same issue"
Fit was fine but it's not faux leather all over. It has leather like material near the laces and the back and sides are cheap brown elastic  with Velcro to close up the back. It looks decent for the price  but not believable or slimming at all.
I thought the material would be thicker.
I love the look and comfort only bad thing is the top of the straps start to cut into you foot after walking for about 30 minutes. I tried wetting the straps and wearing them to help loosen the straps but its going to take more tries until this breaks in. I am willing to try because these are good shoes to dress  up or dress down in.
smaller than I had hoped but too much of a hassle to return so I kept them for a friend
I did not like the fit of this tee. It did not match the description. The vendor was very gracious about taking it back.
It's okay. The size adjustment is a bit janky.
"Most people thought I was a mouse, so it was a fail on that part. Otherwise, it's a warm costume, and well made."
They crease in a weird way on the top when you try to step.
Cute dress but I wish I had ordered a large instead Xl
"My specs, weight 135lbs, height 5'3, waist 28"". So I bought the ""black latex"" as it is described in size small...first of all it is NOT LATEX. I have a latex waist trainer so i know the difference. This material is a thick silk/polyester material with very minimal to no stretch...so two points off for wrong description. That aside..according to the size chart in the pictures I wud be a medium but I ordered small for a more snug fit. It does fit tight on the first hooks...my advice start hooking from the bottom up which makes it easier. The length goes from under boobs and stops at the top of my butt, so it covers all midsection. It will show that you're wearing it under tight clothing, maybe a smooth shapewear over it would help disguise it. Overall it gets the job done and takes off some inches. Hope this review helps."
"The red color was pretty faded, almost a pink. I'd like to use Rit dye to make it darker for next time."
"Got for a Halloween costume and husband ended up not even wearing it.  I may have missed this but it's really, really shiny.  Some kind of silk."
Not too clear that an XL is equivalent to a size 8 but because they are Warners that had a little more give than the Hanes I bought at target. Perhaps I would have been happier with an XXL but if I skip a few meals I will love them more.
Hoping the waist band will stretch out some
Fuzz from the liner is everywhere after just a couple of hours of wearing them!  After about 2 days of wearing them indoors there is still fuzz coming off in large clumps.  Otherwise the shoe itself and design are really nice and seems like it will hold up if you can deal with the liner.  Had to return.
"I love Clarks shoes.  I wish their sizing was more consistent.  I've ordered 6+ pairs of ladies shoes hoping to get a good fit, but have had to mail them all back.  One order wasn't with Prime so I had to pay quite a bit to ship back.  I'm keeping these, but will have to stretch them some."
"This style does nothing for my figure, and is not more comfy than my wire bras."
I will have to get a small size
"Very well made and wears nice, however cup size too small. I even did my measurements before ordering per guide. I would go up one."
top really small
"I received this watch case yesterday, great shipping received several days before the promise date, however I'm returning it today. Please note I believe this watch case could be a great value for the price. This case is attractive, the white stitching against the black PU leather was very well done neat and even around entire perimeter, useful locking feature w/ two keys and removable pillows to permit storing of other jewelry items like rings etc. However, the one I received was not assembled well the bottom cover was coming off around the entire edge. I though just a few dots of the ultimate krazy glue would reseal edges back ...not so. Although I am returning mine I gave it three stars because I do think it makes an attractive display and a very classy gift, if mine was assembled properly I would have given it five. There are often mfg. glitches when processing hundreds of items at a time. I have no doubt, if you get a well assembled one you will be quite pleased. I purchased my son two very interesting watches for the holiday and thought the case would make a tasteful presentation and maybe even encourage my young man to organize his dresser better... A mother can only hope!"
The color is the same as what I already received from a different company. I returned it thanks to a quick response from the company.
"I'm 5'2"" 135 lbs. It is pretty large on me. It comes about 3 inches above my knees unlike the model where its thigh high. the style is growing on me, however. The color a is nice aqua or sea foam blue/green. So is the crochet detail. I was hoping it would drape nicely but it is just very boxy on me. I did shrink it a little bit in the wash and I will get use out of it as a swimsuit cover-up. Would be great for hiding imperfections or on someone taller than me. Overall I think it was worth the price. It came in 10 days which was much faster than I had expected."
Lovely quality but they shrank horribly after first wash and became way too short.
A little snug. Might stretch after wearing and washing.
"description is false, not 100% sterling silver. spacer ring not sterling."
"well its nice to look at. but its also very cheap looking. you can barely read what it says. my sister didn't even realize it said something i had to point it out she does not wear or need glasses but she had to put the necklace close to her eyes to be able to see the writing,."
"Thought this bag would have been more durable. It didn't last me very long. However, I loved the little bag and it served my purposes while I used it, pity it wasn't strong enough to endure daily use. The material of this bag is soft to the touch"
"Much too tough for a dress jeans , maybe for cowboys and tough jobs , spoilt by Levis comfort."
My daughter said they were uncomfortable.
Its okay if you are truly a minimalist but this wallet will not hold too many credit cards at once and can only hold a minimal amount of bills as well.  I bought this and the Trayvax metal wallet and like that one better.  It holds more things and I still feel like I am somewhat a minimalist with it.  Not ready for the extreme minimalist yet I guess.  Overall the wallet is well made and durable.
Came torn / un sewn
Not as thick as I expect but my girl loves them.
I chose these pants based on the reviews and they are still a little small in the butt area.  Overall I like the pants and will keep them...motivation to lose weight
"Brought a size 6.  They are ""okay"" but next time would buy a size bigger"
"Brand new and zipper would not catch properly.  Neither zipper would catch and although I'm a petite six and have other Larry Levine apparel, this is too small, even without zipping!
Please immediately replace with a medium and please first check zippers!"
I don't like the fabric. Looks chip.
"this irse is way smaller than i thought. i kinda like it tho, it's just that the handle is very hard and can't even tuck it in.
i received this product for free or at a discounted price in exchange of my unbiased and honest review"
"Cant wear heavy socks with them, but if you wear a thin dress sock you can wear them most of the day
Shame their a little tight because they appear to be made well"
"Has a pretty long bill. Makes it quite functional. Makes it less aesthetically pleasing, though."
"Eh quality. Not good looking at all. I didn't use mine much until just a few months ago when I needed a bigger bag. After just a little while of use, I've got small holes in the bottom. Not hindering yet, but I definitely haven't used it so much to warrant holes starting!"
"If they fit well than I would love them
But they are too small so i have to wear them low
I wish I could return and get a different size"
"Pros:
- very comfortable
- no annoying tag (very comfortable)

Cons:
- tears after a while
- pills a little (not as comfortable after a few months)
- too tight in front even for average ""package"""
"I ordered these smaller as I was told they run big but I was unable to wear these for more than a few minutes without them rubbing and starting to create blisters. Not good, they are so cute."
"This is a good, versatile, lightweight bag with some key deficiencies that could make it a great bag if some parts of the bag could be addressed.

The good:
- You can see that the bag folds into itself and it's relatively lightweight at 1.5lbs.  You can pack it in your suitcase when leaving for a trip and come back with the duffle full as you pick up things along the way.
- 45L is good size. Holds a lot.
- Lockable 2-way zippers for main compartment.
- Beefy handles on the outer ens of the bag.
- Good colors
- The fact you can carry it as a backpack, though it put some unnatural weight on my spine when the bottom portion of the bag had some weight so I had to make sure to keep the weight towards the top of the bag when worn as a backpack.  However, this is the ONLY way you can really carry the bag (see misses).

Major misses:
- No grab handle pair like regular duffle bags - it's not always pratical to carry the bag with the shoulder straps, especially if you have a separate backpack already, which many will be, whether out and about in the city or in the airport.  The ommission of regular grab handles is baffling.  It's awkward at best to try to carry the bag like a regular duffle bag using the shoulder strips.
- No shoulder strap.

Also, the removable shoulder straps are a bit quirky but I'm fine with it.  The problem is, once you remove them and pack them away for checking in the bag at the airport, now the only handles that exist on the bag are the two beefy handles at the tail ends of the bag and this requires both arms (or you use one and the bag is slumped to the ground). If you're pulling a rolling suitcase, have a backpack, and then have this duffle, you really desperately need regular grab handles so you can carry this bag with one hand or over the shoulders and additionally a dedicated shoulder strap.

I'd love to see an update to the bag in the following:
MAJOR:
- Address the ""handle"" issues mentioned above. I'd accept the slight increase in weight to get these.
MINOR:
- 2 way zippers for the pair of outer pockets.
- zipper pocket inside the main compartment.
- Add locking chest strap to the backpack straps.

If Eagle Creek would update this bag and address the misses, I'd buy another one."
Good value for the price but don't get it wet as water will condense on the inside of the face and you cant read the time.
"Fit as expected.

I have yet to put them through one wash/dry cycle, so I can't comment how they came out (yet).
But these shorts have an unintentionally funny English translation of how to care for thm - so that was like a bonus.
Instruction #3
Put at air-ventilated circumstance after wash is preferable."
I just wish there was pockets and more larger sizes.
Very comfy shirt. However the size felt like one size too big. I normally wear 2xl and they fit me nicely. This 2xl feel like a 3xl. Shirt felt baggy and fluffed up. It was too big for me to tuck in. If the size is true 2xl I would've given this shirt 5 stars. I might try to throw it in the dryer few times to see if it will shrink.
"It ok, no big product...."
"The material is a little on the thin side, but overall the gown is ok.  I should have ordered a small."
Way toooo padded and heavy I was looking for something light and not as padded.
I got a size larger then I normally wear but it was still small.
"Excellent product , very satisfied"
"Liked the style, ordered size 36, it was too small, wanted to exchange for a bigger size but it was too large."
Disappointed in the Carhartt name.  Older T shirts are much heavier.  These were supposed to be 6.75 heavy workwear.  These are not as heavy and durable as others.
"They are a bit tight, but hopefully will stretch out a bit. Nice quality shoes."
"cute sweats, run small"
"I thought the socks would fit shoe size 9-11.  I wear a size 10 in shoes.  When the socks arrived, they said, ""Fits shoe size 6-9.""  So, they are a little small.  I thought the ad said ""Shoe size 9-11."""
"The suit is really cute, but trying to find the right size was a challenge. I normally wear an XL and wound up with the 2X. It fits better but was hoping the panty part would have more hold."
First pair I put on had a small hole in the toe.
A little to tight in the back they should have made the back longer.
Cute suit. Bottoms a tad large for me. The cup size was too small for me and the additional material was extremely excessive. I ended up cutting the material off.
"ok, looks ok, will do for the money"
"The bra is well-made and comfortable, but the cup size seemed to be smaller than the same cup size in other bras. The clasp mechanism does twist sideways when you wear it."
It does the job. Quality is mediocre
I really liked these shoes but was disappointed that they didn't fit. I didn't want to try a bigger size because I was afraid they'd be too big plus they cost more.
Had to return which was very easy!
very pretty but need to buy a bit above on sizes
"The fit and comfort level of this shirt is OK but the photos do not accurately depict the degree to which these shirts have a sheen, making them look somewhat feminine in some cases. Various somewhat by color and lighting in the room but these do not have the same texture or ""flat"" appearance as a typical cotton or 50/50 type t-shirt."
"I read others' reviews and ordered half a size larger. They were HUGE. They were also heavy and chunky and I did not find them comfortable. Had to send them back. I do think they were well made, though, so if you like a chunky boot, this one would probably serve you well."
"The shoe was more pink than nude colored, so I returned it.  Quite good quality for the price!"
"I love this ring. I lost the first one bought 10 months ago so I had to order another one. It's usually always on, I shower with it and there has been no fading or change to the metal. I only gave 3 stars because one of the stones came out after 4 months. That did not happen with the first one I bought, So that was disappointing. I still wear the ring but haven't decided if I'll order another one."
"I am currently wearing a pair of Prince Tennis shoes for playing tennis. I love them because they are a great fit for people with wide feet. I was hoping this reasonably priced K-Swiss could replace my current pair that is starting to fray after 2 years. But I found that it was not a great fit for my wide feet and therefore I returned it.
I love Amazon's free shipping and free return shipping deals especially for apparel since with apparel you can't tell for sure till you try it."
"In the discription was written about leather upper when I bought it. but it is man-made. It is too expensive for man-made, it doesn't cost this money"
I wish it were a bit wider and longer.
"Yeah, it is shiny...and I can't wear it till it gets colder....non breathable fabric, which i thought I was getting a summer one....this is for winter and shiny occasions"
"These were HUGE.  My 80 year old Mom who had a stroke takes a size 9.  Her feet are swollen so these are perfect for people with swollen feet as they are nicely adjustable.  We ordered the size 9 but there was a full 2"" of empty space in the toe area.....unbelievable.  Makes me wonder if they were labeled wrong.

Also the height and weight of these slippers (I would call them shoes) may be a problem for some people.  It doesn't list the height of the heel in the description that I could see but based on the picture I thought maybe it was 1/2"".  Well they are about 1-1/2"" high which may make it difficult for an elderly person to walk.

The shoes are very well made but VERY very heavy and clumsy.  They would be great for a younger person with some strength - or perhaps for an elderly person who does not plan to walk in them.  I would not want to wear them myself much less for a disabled person who is weak."
"I think this is a good kit, but I am not confident that I have used it properly... I need to get instructions before trying again."
"Pitiful and childish looking. Needed for work, but gave to 10 year old granddaughter who loves pink."
"I bought this product because my husband loves Docker's pants.  I had chosen a ""cloud"" color, because that one is the he likes more, but when it arrived the color is like a light brown, instead ""Cloud"".  Cloud as I see on the picture is more like white."
"I received these as a gift, but sadly had to return them.  The quality is good, but the glasses are really small.  They have a cat-eye sporty kind of a look to them.  The frame lens is so short that my eyelashes kept hitting the top of the frame.  I kept looking over the top of them, kind of like you would if you were wearing readers.  My gifter agreed that if the sunglasses were even 1/4 inch taller, they would be keepers.  Note that I am a small person and smaller glasses generally work well for me."
I won't say it is strangely large but it is large. You've to order a size down I supposed because a small fits like a medium and a x-small fits like a small. Or is that how it's supposed to fit? It should slightly flow on you I guess but it's not a soft material so it doesn't flow. It's cotton but not yet cotton. It's more of a thick sort of cotton. I'm just going to make a few adjustments to yet another top. But nice thick material and lovely pocket. I just love the pattern. Overall it's okay. Good casual blouse to have when you don't feel like going all out.
Good slippers for the money.
"It's lightweight and it keeps the rain off,the hood is a little too big as it'll drop over your eyes and obstruct your view if you put it on. A decent product but you'll probably want to buy a cap with this product if you intend to wear it in the rain."
"Cute shoe, but not as durable as I would have hoped.  The small tab in the back started fraying within a week."
"shoe is heavy, but look cute on"
Do not dry it! but super cute
"Leaning toward the smaller, snug side, but, I really like them!"
Not crazy  about the looks. I don't like pointy toes!!! They were less expensive than my usual brand so you get what you paid for.
"I could probably complain about this item for ever. It isn't the seller's fault that the item's designer is a moron that is losing them money. Two nonfunctional pieces that should have been one functional piece. Save plastic,  don't force the user to choose which part they want to wear.  If this item had been made properly,  it could easily fetch more money. add the special features, could get much more.  Ultimately ditched this item for another."
The bag in general is okay. The issue is the metal clasp. It is hard to close and you just cant leave it opened because your things inside it will fall out as it purse leans on its side if the clasp is not secure. I have used this purse for several months now & the material contexted to the clasp appears to be ripping...so I have stopped using it. I expect my purses to be able to handle the normal wear of a purse. this didn't really cut it.
"The idea is great! I love it so much Im buying 2, but that's the problem. I HAD to buy two. I have somewhat of a narrow foot, but not really. I wear 9.5 shoes. These were WAAYY to big for athletic shoes, even only using all the smaller ones and leaving the bigger 4 (2 for each foot). In order to make this work I need to order a second set to get more smaller pieces. In the end I will be thrilled with the result... but really, I had to buy two to make it work. $17 shoe laces. Pick another brand.

If you found this helpful, please thumbs up"
"nice shoe, but ran somewhat small"
I purchased these sandals specifically because they came in a wide size but their wide is equivalent to other brand's M width. Lengthwise they fit perfectly but I could barely get my son's foot in them because of how narrow they were and they didn't have the tab on the heel to assist in getting them on either. I loved how cushy they are on the inside. It's too bad they didn't work out.
"I bought a couple of these for the family.  About as expected, but probably wouldn't buy again.  In terms of fit, it fits my 3yr old well and he has a pretty big head.  As an adult I can just barely get it to to fit, but I never wear it very long anyway as I'm 20 seconds from being chased or whacked by little pirate kids.  The downside is that these hats are quite wide.  No fault to this particular hat, but more to this type of hat in general.  Given it's so wide and comes out from your head by 4 inches on each side, when you start raising your arms or swinging toy swords invariably your arm bumps it and knocks it off....or causes it to spin on your head.  Kids especially since they have narrow shoulders.  It never stays on straight.  Plus it curls up in the back as well, so there's not much actually wrapped around your head to keep it snug.  Kind of just sits on top.  Nothing like the fit of a baseball cap (which is what I sometimes wear instead to protect my eyes if I have multiple kids coming after me, especially if they're the older 5+ and swing hard with the foam swords).  In general these hats don't stay on for more than a minute because they get bumped off or spun sideways on your head.

As others mentioned, there's no white trim on these, just the white skull and crossbones."
I ordered the white dress and it smelled like fecal matter and urine! There were yellow stains that took a couple of washes to get out but the smell is still slightly noticeable. Be careful! It's a very cute dress but the smell is probably not worth it!
"I purchased these boots because I was looking for a pair of general use winter boots. These are cute, but do not provide much additional warmth over my regular hiking boots.

 Additionally, the insoles do not provide any support and are not removable.  If I wear them all day at work, my feet are sore at the end of the day.

Last thing, six weeks in (wearing once or twice a week), the seams are already seeping moisture into the boot. The deepest snow these have been in is about 5 inches.

Wear them to town if you are just going from the car into a building, but I wouldn't walk the dog or do any actual outdoor activities in them."
"Update: I put these on my feet and they are soft. Not as soft as I expected but softer than they felt to my hands. Might buy more.

These are not soft. Being advertised as Cashmere, I was hoping they would be soft. They have 30% Cashmere, but it's not enough to make them soft. They feel like regular wool. Would not recommend."
"Super cute & warm, but it runs incredibly snug. I have a hard time getting it over my son's head when I put it on him or take it off."
"This is a really cool looking shirt, but ti does fit very small and fitted.  I am pretty tall and it just didn't come down far enough on me for me to keep it.  But returns were a breeze."
I ordered these shoes(kim loafer) because I love Dansko shoes. They were way to small. Dansko's are usually tight to start and then form to your feet but these are about a half to a whole size off. The actually shoe in brown looks nice. Had to return them.
"I like the style of these, but the colors i received are strange.....like neon colors."
You can see through the bottom.  So unless you are wearing it over a swimsuit or have a slip on underneath it is only going ot be suitable for home use.
"I ordered this because I thought it looked like a great moderate-coverage two-piece for an upcoming vacation. I ordered the size the chart said I would fit best in. Upon arrival, I was thrilled to find the bottoms fit perfectly! The top seems to be sized for someone with little or no boobs. :(  That's not me. I initiated a return on this, but then cancelled the return because I love the bottoms so much. I went to JC Penney and bought an appropriately sized black swim top to go with this."
"My kid liked them just fine - he has fat feet, and they went on better than most shoes."
"The shoes seemed to fit perfectly right out of the box but after walking around with them for about an hour, I got blisters on my little toes. I think the toe box may be a little too large which is allowing my toes to rub...not sure if that's the problem or not. I usually wear a size US 7-7.5  or a European 38. Would like to send them back but they are a little scuffed up now."
The sole started separating from the shoe pretty quickly and I find it then gots caught on lots of things. Comfortable at first but ultimately crapped out quickly.
"This is a nice shoe BUT very narrow.  By the time I was able to get this shoe on my grandson, using a shoe horn, the velcro barely met & did not stay shut."
"This jacket fit as expected and looks great. I would never say this as waterproof, a rain coat, or even water-resistent. It repels a little bit of water, but it doesn't take much for the water to seep in. A rain storm does result in weat skin. It is a nice coat for cooler spring/summer/fall days though."
Walmart quality boxy fitting tshirt. But my son loves it. Wish it was cheaper but oh well.
"For what its worth, I returned this.  It has very thin straps, a thin band with two small hooks and just didn't feel like it was offering any support at all.  If you are looking for something fairly lightweight and delicate, this may be perfect for you.  For a daily wear brassiere that will lift and separate....not so much."
This hat looks like it had been run over by a truck.  But it will keep the sun off..and that is what it is supposed to do...so I'll keep it around for next summer when I work in the yard.  Don't buy it thinking you'll make a fashion statement. ;)
"This is an okay shoe, which is very disappointing given the price (and the brand). I was expecting more. First off, they run very large for their size! I got size 6 toddler and it's half an inch longer than the chart says (I measured the inside sole). Also, their design isn't very practical for active toddlers. They are cut very shallow, with the strap too far forward, leaving a very big open area, so the foot easily slips out the back, even with socks on. I always try to get my toddler shoes with straps that go across the front, to keep shoes from slipping out since she's very active, and I thought these ones fit the requirement, but since the strap is so far forward, they don't. The strap is also very stiff and has no give, so I can't pull and close it tighter. As a result, the shoes are constantly falling off and tripping up my poor kid. And I know it's not a size issue because she has another pair of new shoes by a different brand, mary janes also a little bigger than her foot, but with a strap closer to the ankle and able to be tightened, and those stay on just fine.

And finally, these get dirty very easily. I should've known better than to get canvass shoes for a toddler. At least they aren't white. I'll stick to leather (real or fake) because it wipes easily.

Other than that, the shoes seem sturdy and well made. I'm just very unhappy with the design and the fit, and don't think they were worth the money given that there are better shoes for less out there (so my search continues)."
"I wore these around the house for a few days before wearing them for walking, and I thought they were amazing, and looked good.  But once I wore them for walking (walked about 10 city blocks, wore them at office, then 10 more city blocks), the thong hurt as soon as I was walking on the street, really bad.  By the time I got home, they were brutal, and my feet hurt horribly.  I guess these would still be fine for wearing just to the market, or to do a few errands, if you are driving, but they might not be good if you have to walk more than a block because of the thong between the toes.  I never had a problem with the thong style before, so I'm pretty disappointed, and pretty annoyed because I probably can't return them now.  You might want to get some Birkis that don't have the thong. :)"
I love the way these pants fit ontop but the length and the width of the bottoms is huge! I can deal with the length but the width is just too much.
"These were comfortable for about an hour. I had to wear these in a friends wedding. By the time we had gotten ready, drove to the venue, and walked down the isle I was about to die. I asked my groomsman to carry me...
SO if you're not a wimp like I am, go ahead and buy these babies. BTW they look awesome on, even with jeans."
Its really tight.  If you are broke this thing would work great.  If you carry a bunch of cash you might look elsewhere.
Cute. To wide for my narrow feet. Returned them.
"I'd order at least two cup sizes up.  Cute, comfortable and good life but runs small."
"Its large in the neck area, I don't know if each shirt varies but thats how it was for me"
"Okay shoe, just didn't feel right when I put it on. Seemed to be nicely made and good quality, good colors."
"I really wanted to love these but they were too narrow in the toe box, a common problem for me.  Had to return them."
They are a little bigger than I would like but that is my fault.  My qualm with them is that they began to tarnish and change colors almost immediately after the first time I wore them.  They are good for what they are but don't expect much.
"This sandal is great. The initial break in period is a bit of a pain but just go slow and wear them for a few hours each day and within a week or two you should be able to wear them around the clock. My major complaint about these shoes is that bottom soles on my first pair wore down to the cork within 6 months and now I need to look at getting them fixed. They should last way longer than than but in defense of the shoe, I did wear them every single day for those 6 months. I now have a second pair so I don't have to be without while I repair the first.

I did buy both pairs at a local store however. I attempted online ordering of these and they arrived clearly worn. It isn't hard to tell with Birks - after about a day you'll see an imprint of the foot on the footbed. So be careful when buying online and be prepared to send them back because you may end up with a pair that was a previous return.

As for sizing, you'll likely end up wearing a size slightly smaller than what you are used to. I wear a 38 in Birks which is a woman's 7 (I normally wear an 8 in most shoes). My husband wears a 42/men's 9 when he is typically a 10.5. Keep that in mind when ordering,"
shoes fit length wise but they are a little wide making the shoes feel really lose while wearing them
"I bought it several months ago and they were not comfortable at the beginning, I wear them occasionally and they are still quite stiff. Hope they will conform to my feet soon."
Its just ok... Pictures makes it look like its of better quality. However it will do...
More of a sexy bedroom look
"So this product looks awesome, but the size wasn't right. I did order a size bigger like someone recommended, but they suit didn't fit length wise. It showed a lot of crack and was very uncomfortable in the front. I am tall with long hips though... So it may work for you!"
"Looks nice, did not fit what so ever."
don't like the area around the leg - not enough padding
"It's very cute. But, I don't think it's even worth the small amount I paid for it. Fabric feels cheap and stiff. I will probably give it to my 4 year old daughter to play with."
"The zipper is really poor quality and never really worked right. I thought it was SO cute and wanted my son to be able to wear it while driving around in his Case power wheel, but eventually had to stop because my husband would get mad when the zipper would come undone in the chilly weather."
"I gave these earrings only 3 stars because the depth of color isn't what it appears to be from the photo. Also, they have natural occlusion that don't show in the photo either. But they are still a pretty pale red earring."
"They are ok, but I was expecting a little better. That being said they are fine for around the house."
"The bottom pocket is a flap, which is a little strange (I would have preferred it to be secured). It smell awful when I got it, and I had to let it air out for several days before use. That said, it is cheap and holds everything I need conveniently, so I can't complain too much."
"Liked it, but had to return cause it was too small around the waist.  I gave it 3 stars cause the quality and design are excellent and had it not been for fit I would've rated this a 5 star."
"I measured myself and bought the correct size. I nearly pulled a muscle getting it on. And getting it off? Major difficulties - almost had to tag my husband in for some help!! While it was on, it looked great and really tamed my tummy. But I would much sooner buy another brand that's cheaper and easier to get on and off."
very cut dress but  the lace fell apart on it even with gentle wash
"Love the color, but they do seem to run a little small."
A little thin material but overall happy
Very difficult to get on because there is no zipper.
They didn't last long looking new. The material is cheap.
"These jeans fit really strangely. They're very long, and the belt loops are placed in a way that you can't use them with an actual belt. I'm 5'7"" and I found that I had a few extra inches of material on the end of the pants. It didn't look terrible, but you could tell that they were too long for me. Also for anyone who's thicc... you know the struggle of jeans either fitting in your butt+thighs or your waist, and just resolving yourself to using a belt. These jeans are not going to let you do that. The belt loops are not at the top of the pant, they're kind of in the middle of where the pants hit, so they sit on your hips more than your waist. As a result, you're obviously not going to be able to get a belt through since your hips are much wider than your waist is. They didn't gape horribly at my waist, but that coupled with the length made it a deal breaker for me and I ended up returning these. The actual quality of the material seemed fine-- the jeans were thicker and closer to jean material than jegging material. I think these jeans would be good for anyone who is taller than me (so maybe 5'9""+) and has less dramatic curves in the butt and thighs."
"Alright for the price, but not something i'd want to be walking around in for long.  Not the comfort of other sanuks, but are cute."
"I was surprised when I received this bracelet , the beads look and feel plastic. I will still wear it but ........"
I ordered the green but received the blue and I am not happy about it
"quality is goo, runs little large, not the fit shirt"
Waist too small.
"I like this top but it's not as stretchy as expected. Although the material at the back is of a jersey texture, the front is a completely different material and it offers very little room for stretching."
This dress is beautiful and fits GREAT from waiste down....It is true to size if you are a B or C cup....40C would be a bit snug but you maybe able to button it. The dress has no stretch.....I cant upload the picture or I would do so. If you're comfy wearing a tank and leavn it open....it would work. Its just not what I wanted to do so I'm returning it.
"I gave these sandals a 3-star rating, which I thought was generous.

No arch support. The opposite, in fact.

There are better quality, more comfortable options to be found in the $12 price range. The only thing comfortable is the heel cushioning, which is okay.

EDITED: After wearing these a little more I've noticed a little more arch support. perhaps they needed some weight on them to ""break them in"". Whatever the case may be, at least they're offering a little improvement in this respect, which is important for me.

Still just a 3-star rating, though."
So-so. Will go back to Dearfoams. Not as comfy or cushy as Dearfoams.
"The idea of a halter dress is amazing. But if you are not big busted, then it may not look as sexy. There was not much support around the neck. I want to try and tighten it a bit to try an add a bit of support to the top part. The dress is very short and does not flare much. I'm keeping it and using it anyway...once dolled up, it's gotta look good. :D"
"too large to fit into my pocket and honestly has a cheap feel to it, i ended up just sticking with my current wallet and gave this one to my little brother."
"These are not a full cut panty. They are ok, and the lacy elastic at the waist is nice, but I would go up a size if I order again."
Does not fit me.  Too long for petite size.  Will be returning.
It was a little large. Got it for my Son and his wife. They both have motorcycles. Hope it works
"The inner seem split the second day I wore them, but they were a little snug. As long as they are a bit loose on you, you should be ok."
Poorly made! But price is cheap so I will keep it. I had to adjust it for myself.
"Warm and water resistant. Except, they cut the circulation off to my pinky fingers so they don't stay warm.  I was exactly between a 7 and 8 and bought the 7.  For me, they are very difficult to pull on but the thumbs/fingers are too long. (1/2"" or more.)  I think I have shorter than average length fingers for the size of my palm, but not enough to explain the excess length in these gloves.  I also have no idea how you'd get a hand warmer in the zipper compartment unless you buy a size too big for you."
Wife uses them but could be a bit bigger she said.
"It's an umbrella, so it does what its suppose to do, keep you dry.  The lighting is dismal, nothing spectacular, it would be great if the lighting (bulbs) were on both sides of the umbrella which would give a better illuminating brightness. The reflecting markings on the umbrella are good. Wouldn't recommend this product because of the non-light factor if that's what you're looking for, that was the main reason for my purchase.  Better off using a regular umbrella."
"My son loves these shorts! Update. The shorts are two months old and today the zipper broke and cannot be repaired. I guess I should be happy they lasted the summer, but I'm disappointed, nonetheless."
just ok. wasn't long enough. they're just added to my collection of costume jewelry. i'm sure at some point i'll get to wear them...but not for the event i purchased them for.
"couldve purchased smaller size i ordered 5 im 5'1 135 lbs couldve fit the3.
great style as pictured love the pants"
work as thought
foot pad is short while the straps are too loose and not adjustable
Use for garden.  Easy to put on for just walking around in wet grass watering plants and pulling weeds.
"These are cute, but they're going back because they are just too hard to get on to my daughter's foot. I'm going to have to stick with the shoes that velcro near the top.  I also thought they were a bit heavy."
"These are no comfier than they look.  There's not much support or padding.  However, they don't actually pinch or chafe.  They do scuff up on the toes, and that's not cute, but I wear them anyway."
"These are nice earrings, but are lacking in finely made workmanship. I think they are stylish, classy and timeless. They were larger than I was expecting, but the measurements are accurate. One of the prong clasps was too loose for my liking so I bit it to make it more snug fitting. The sterling silver is well polished. The hoop is hollowed out wherever possible, so the earrings are not too heavy. There are no light holes behind the stone settings, like you'll find in better made knock off jewelry. There is one thing about these earrings that doesn't please me and this is the reason I gave them 3 stars instead of 5. The blue color is very odd. The color looks nothing like any shade of sapphire I have ever seen. If you are specifically hoping for or expecting these earrings to resemble the look of sapphires then you will not be pleased. The blue shade is a very strange hue along the lines of medium to light denim or somewhat like a cornflower blue. To me, there is no hint of purple, so they will never be mistaken for tanzanite (which would have been nice). I do think the photo color is a very good representation of the color of the stones in person. That being said, when I had the earrings in my hand, I thought the color was so odd. Anyone who knows anything about jewelry and stones is going to know that these scream fake/costume. I tried to take many photos of these earrings beside another pair of sapphire colored stones I have for comparison, but I could not get the photo to depict the remarkable color difference. I have nothing against costume or fake jewelry whatsoever, but certain styles (like these earrings) which are of such a classic style (in my opinion) look silly and so fake when they color representation is so unnatural. I realize my opinions on the color of these stones may not be an issue at all for some people. If you fall into this category then you will likely be very satisfied with these earrings. If the style of these earrings were trendy or funky then I wouldn't be bothered by the stone color."
Husband has Neuropthy and could not hold them on
"I bought a Medium (which is my usual size), and it fits fine. It's a bit more snug than really ""necessary."" The straps cut into my shoulders just a bit; hopefully it will stretch with more wear.

Seems like this would be a fantastic bra for larger-chested girls.

My biggest issue with it is its feature- the neckline. I can really only wear this bra with a tshirt; if I wear it with any of my tank tops, the sides of the V-neck peek out awkwardly. The neckline looks much lower in pictures than it feels in person. This might be an asset if you were wearing the bra by itself (which this bra is probably well-suited to in thickness and style), but under shirts it is a bit bulky and cumbersome.

I will not be buying again, because it just is not suited to me, but it seems like a good bra (I love the material) if you like the style."
Super cute & comfy... but the shoe started falling apart only 2 months after.
He says these are OK - I bought them since the Timberland pros price went up like 40 bucks - they will do but will need to find something different next time
"I love them except: the jeans slide too easily down my rear end if I bend over, etc. I am always tugging them up. I wonder if the waistband is too ""relaxed"".  I hate to wear belts! I have to wash them after 2 wears, to get the waistband tighter, which is annoying!"
"The bra fits well and looks nice, but doesn't offer any ""discreetness"". I expected it to offer higher quality material to ensure my nipples weren't exposed through my shirts."
Really cute but runs really small pay close attention to the size chart
"Size runs large. I wish I could say more but it didn't feel because it wasn't true to size. Even with their bigger a little room, it was no supportive. It was an itchy and terrible material. I don't like it."
"I am a Medium and needed a Large, when I got the Large the top was too big. Thankfully w Prime there was free shipping on the returns!"
"I ordered my normal size (8.5) and I should've ordered a half size up.  They're really cute, but they rub on my ankles and squeeze my toes so they aren't all that comfortable.  I might try wearing them with thick socks at home to try to stretch them out."
"I like elephants and have plenty of elephant things. But I think the elephant head on this ring is way too large, so the whole head and trunk kind of sticks out. If you really love elephants it will probably be a good buy for you, but otherwise you should probably go with another animal wrap ring. There are more of this same style with different animals."
"This is a good size watch for those (like me) who have small wrists. I like the watch, but don't like the color of the band. WHY don't they offer a nice navy/ pink or navy w anything stripe in this size?? Very frustrating! I disliked the green band so much that I ordered a replacement band in Navy/orange (same 16mm width) which is nice, but a full TWO inches longer than the perfectly-sized green band... I can't win! The band is so long that it's useless to me. I tried to trim it and now it's frayed and can't even be returned! Please, TIMEX, fix this simple problem so that I can enjoy wearing your reliable and cute watches again!!"
Quality of leather is good but the shoe's part near buckle hurts my ankles.
"First, this shoe is cute, and very comfortable! But sadly I wish I'd heeded the warning of another reviewer- it IS a pain in the butt to have to do/undo four buckles to put on/take off the shoes. PUT IN A ZIPPER!!!"
"Well when I got the product one of the clasps immediately broke off. I was able to put it together so no biggie but still it was a hassle. It is a little big for my 17 month old even if adjusted to the tightest side but it's okay, still somewhat works."
Cheap material and look
"Nice looking but can't get them in my ears.  I've tried and tried and tried.  The end of the  ""post"" is flat when it would be better rounded.  I can open and close them in my hands easily and they stay closed, but I just can't wear them.  So disappointed."
works better as a shirt then a dress
"Expected it to be more ""navy"" than ""denim."" It's ok. I wish I would have bought another color."
the legs were to long
"The bag is a little heavy on its own. Also, the strap has an inner brown lining, which makes it look really cheap. The wristlet is nice though. Still deciding if I should return it."
"Very thin product, super cute for my daughter as long as their feet don't sweat, and the strings inside actually cut off a bit of circulation to toes"
The skirt is OK. I wasn't really impressed. But it's wear-able. Bandage dresses/skirts tend to be a bit thicker so I was disappointed how thin it was.
The shoe is not bad.  The gel padding isn't great and due to arch support problems I had to use an insert for my arch.  Not the most comfy but not the worst.
better quality and cuter than I was expecting.
"I love naughty monkey boots and was excited to see a cute gray boot built on the same platform (a sister company) in Not Rated.

They fit the same as naughty monkey, about a quarter to half size forgiving.  I usually wear between an 8.5 and 9.  In these brands an 8.5 fits a bit big.  I was pleased with the fit and style of the boot, however, I never buy faux leather and these boots reminded me of why.  There is noway you could pass these off as genuine leather (at least in the gray).  I sent them back.  Had the quality of materials been better I'd have kept them-- and would have been willing to spend significantly more.

I acknowledge that as a low cost knee high these boots are a wonderful option.  But if you are hoping this boot will look rich you will be disappointed."
"Big in the waist by several inches, but virtually perfect everywhere else. I'm not sure if I'm going to keep them and take in the waist, or send them back. For the $7 I spent on them, I'll probably end up taking them end, but I don't know that I'd order them again."
"Im only giving this 3stars because i inly have one problem with this swimsuit. The stitching is fine. My buttons are all in place (securely). My grip is the damn waist trim. Every picture shows it being much thicker than what i got. I figure two maybe three inches of the black and white striping, that is also on the swimsuit top, at the very least i was hoping for an inch and half. But what i recieved was just about an inch. I should've bought an all black one that i was originally looking at. I don't take pictures often especially in this little clothes. Im sucking it up for the sake of the truth."
I found them to be somewhat tight and small
I'm a large and purchase 1X and it was snug.  Good quality
"Ordered this for my 3yo birthday pictures. I'm not completely sold on it yet.
While the outfit is adorable, the bow on the shirt is not attached and comes off very easily, and the fabric of the skirts is rough and scratchy."
"Too narrow and strap too tight- otherwise length was fine. Returned. Too bad, these are VERY cute!"
It is simply too long and doesn't have shape.
"Feel great and look good, but for me they need dry cleaning."
Nice for the money. Big lenses but frames still too narrow if you have a giant head like me.
"Too small, but not your fault. I meant too order 9mts instead I guess I pushed the wrong button. Don't know how to return."
I found that the waistband is a little tight but they're okay. I'd order a size larger than you are.
Not as much control as I was hoping for but very comfortable
A lot wider than expected. Comfy though but foot slides in sneaker when doing lateral moves
The plus is that I got my $$ back. So disappointed that top had a defect in the middle of the bust area & seam was unraveled.
I usually wear a size 9...but these were not long enough...I ordered another pair.
Very pretty. Have used it for date night. I would not use this for an every day purse. Hardware is to light to stand up to constant use.
"Flattering fit, and very comfortable, but SUPER sheer! I intended to use these for workouts at the gym, but that's not happening! Lounge pants, for sure."
Interesting stretchy material but beware that the sizing is different from other Levi's 514s.  The length is shorter and the waist feels looser (perhaps because of the stretchy fabric.) than the twill levi's 514s I bought at the same time....also from the regular demin Levi's I bought a couple of months ago. This seems to be a  common problem with Levi's these day... oh and don't forget on most Levi's these days the fabric is lighter weight.
The skid material is peeling.
This is nice. But it's itchy. It fit nice. I knew it was going to be kind of small since I'm chubby but it's over all okay. If you're willing to wear something under to prevent the itching it's great.
"Gorgeous, but back strap was too short and shoe was very narrow even though I ordered a half size up.  VERY disappointing. Lovely shoes."
"These are so soft and comfy.  The pair I received had a small hole in them, and they sent a new pair asap, but that pair had a small hole as well.  I still kept them though."
Don't remember this at all. Must not have been what I expected.
Bought for a cosplay to keep my underwear from showing. Should work well.
"I gave this a three only in the fact that even though it said XX Large, which is the size I wear, as I have been losing weight, but I think that the clothing is sized smaller than normal. I would keep that in mind when ordering. The quality and color is everything I expected. I will just have to lose a few more lbs."
"My son is just transitioning from a 4/4t into a 5. Bought the 5/6 thinking it would be a bit big, but for the great price figured I'd get it anyway and he'd grow into it. It ended up fitting pretty well. I'd say the 5/6 definitely runs more toward the 5 than 6 and might be too small for a true 6.

The zipper on this is really sticky, very hard to zip up and down. I like the item and my son likes the colors, but the zipper doesn't function well making this a difficult to wear item as we are constantly struggling with the zipper."
"Hey, for what you pay, its freaking awesome.  The sole is that cheap material usually used for small childrens knock off sneakers.  A cheap china special for sure but good enough for use at the lake which was very jagged and treacherous.  They never fell off my feet when swimming.  I would assume I'll be able to get 2 more solid lake trips out of these and considering how often I plan to use them, I am happy.  Everyone asked about how in the heck I got water shoes so cheap."
this is a bit big but i am just going to make some alterations to it and should be fine.  the color was not quite what I expected but I have found that sometimes that happens more yellow when i thought it would be more creams. I ordered size larger based on most would have been fine had I ordered the xl instead.
"I was (as always) pleased with Amazons seamless process from order to receipt - no issues.

The bag is an average to slightly above average product. As most reviews claim it is spacious and it carries a fair amount of stuff from books, to laptops (small) to folders and files. I used it to go to NYC last week and carry it to  casual meetings and even use it to walk the weekend flea markets. It is a good casual messenger bag - probably best for student use or for people that are carrying a small to moderate amount of stuff. I would not count on this bag for carrying large loads or heavy loads. As a matter of fact, the strap while (materially) heavier than the bag does not sit comfortably when the load in the bag is heavier than just a book or two or a small laptop.

I also thought that the bags material would have been a little stiffer so that the bag would be just a little more rigid. From reading the description and some of the comments I thought that it would be a bit more rugged, instead it is a floppy canvas messenger bag.

All in all, it does the trick and it appears to be a good to average value for the money."
The tie was narrower than I expected.  But the materials and construction were quite good.
"I have a helix cartilage piercing and tragus piercing, which have been healing for over 6 months, but I've been struggling to have them completely heal. I had a job interview coming up, and even though I would have my hair down, I wanted to make sure to hide my ear piercings, so I tried these out.

I looked up online the typical gauge for cartilage piercings and a lot of people said 16g, but I guess mine were pierced with smaller gauges, so when I tried putting this in my helix, it irritated it more. It took quite a bit of pushing, and since it's plastic, I had to be careful to not bend it in the process. Maybe since it doesn't come to a point like a typical metal earring, it's more difficult to put through. I'm not sure. After the struggle of putting it through my helix, I chickened out from switching out my tragus. I would probably feel more comfortable having someone else do it for me instead of doing it myself, but I suspect this was too thick for my tragus anyway. I ended up putting the brown part of a bandaid on top of my tragus piercing and covered it with my hair.

In terms of how it looks, it's pretty unnoticeable compared to typical earrings. I think as long as my piercing doesn't sparkle, I'd be satisfied. If I had my hair up though, I think employers would've noticed from their distance, since it's not completely invisible.

My ears are pretty sensitive to certain metals, and from what I can tell the plastic itself is not irritating my ear. The day after switching my piercing, my ear is still irritated. I will probably leave this earring in until my ear decides to calm down or if I get hired.

Because this part of my ear doesn't necessarily move around, I don't think I'll have issues with the earring popping out, though I do check just to make sure.

One last thing: I tried putting this through my lobe piercings and no such luck, way too big. I've tried putting metal earrings of similar width through and it was a bit tough but doable. Do your research on the gauges of your piercings.  If you think these are maybe too thick, don't test your luck by thinking you can shove it through.

UPDATE: Just as I thought, the plastic itself isn't irritating my sensitive ears. I've slept and showered with it on for the past 3 days, and it's still in my ear. Nothing has popped off.

UPDATE #2: After a week and a half of leaving in this retainer, I decided to take it out and switch it back to my metal earring. There was a persistent soreness, and I don't think it was the fact that it was plastic. Maybe the plastic material had more of a grip and irritated my ear or maybe it was because the gauge was wrong. I'm not sure. When I took it out, there was gunk stuck on the front and in the back, so this material picks up on gunk pretty easily and gets caught. Since it's clear, it'll show and look like a dark spot. I guess retainers are meant for temporary use."
Love them got lot of praise
"I still can't figure if those are gloves or socks, they don't seem any of them because of their shape...or lack of it. But the cap is cute"
"A good flat is generous in the toe box's width and depth.  My toes fit too snugly in these, and the top of my big toe really feels constrained.  Combine this discomfort with the elastic and no arch support, and I'd give these about an hour before I'd want to take them off.  I find that many flats are uncomfortable due to the skimpy cut of the toe box, not much arch support and cheap materials, aka ""pleather.""  I ordered these, and the pink suede.  Both are soft enough.  I ordered the black ones with the shiny stones, and they are stiff."
Somewhat small. Beautiful dress
"Very cute slippers. My 6 year old loves them. They run small, she wears a size 11 in shoes and I ordered a size 13 thinking she could grow into them. I was wrong. They fit her exact and she will probanly only be able to wear them for a few months. I will order the two sizes up because she loves the slippers and was excited to get them."
Fast delivery. These sandals make a squeaking sound when you walk.
Fits our 14 month old grandson well with room to grow but it's not machine washable and not all that soft.
"Really liked the fit and color....but it felt more like vinyl than ""faux leather""  VERY thin material.  I returned it."
really small for xxl.
"This is a standard nursing bra where the front flaps unhook so you can release the boob and feed babe.  It takes a bit of maneuvering to figure out how to take this off one-handed.  The cups that come with the bra are HUGE.  When you wear it, it's like you've grown a cup size.  I ultimately removed them (they are removable from a little hidden slit) and just went with disposable nursing pads inside so I didn't look like I got a boob job during maternity leave.  There are three hook and eyes in the back.  Overall, it fits small.  It seems snug across the torso.  There are also some strap issues.  The main straps can be adjusted by there are these looser straps that are inside and hidden that always seem loose and flopping around."
"I shopped Wild Pair in the mall for years until they closed.  For some reason these are the first pair of Wild Pair shoes that were too big and way too wide around the arch.  Pretty shoes, but they look as cheap as the price I paid for them."
I like the feel of this waist trainer's material however it runs large and offers a light-medium support.  I will be exchanging for a size smaller to see if this resolves the issue.
Material seeme to thin
"As a watch this is a decent device. As a smart watch, Samsung got a few things ""wrong"" with it. To begin with, this watch can be used by itself, paired with a phone or even used as it's own if you can find a carrier compatable with it. It comes with a small handful of apps that makes it appear more useful than what it really is.

The reality is, Samsung wanted this watch so exclusive to the Galaxy series of phones that they basically created a closed platform. From my understanding, they worked as hard as they could to try and make sure only their phones worked with this device. I am under the impression you can infact get this watch to work with a number of other devices, including iPhones, but it is a difficult task.

This watch could have EASILY had more applications to it, but Samsung also created a closed market of apps, just for this watch. You can't go on Google Play and just find apps you want. Instead you have to use Samsung's exclusive app platform to find apps that will work with your watch, this created a market in which there are actually very few useful and thoughtful apps for the watch.

Their only streaming service, Milk Music, was discontinued this year and they never had a back-up plan for that, so besides loading music directly on to your watch (which you can do, 20 song limit) there is no good way to stream music from your watch anymore. I was given the impression that many people were upset with this turn of events.

It's a beautiful watch, it's sturdy and I wear it every day. The problem is, any time I do interact with the watch, I am constantly reminded on how limited the watch was made by Samsung and frustrated with it's lost potental."
"Beautiful flip flop except for the design of the toe area of the shoe. I can't imagine how someone's feet would have to be shaped fit into that area. Short, fat and pinched with a very short big toe and with longer center toes?"
"Very cute design, they look great. The material is a thin and somewhat scratchy material, but if you don't care about that then they're great."
Classy looking shoe but sized way too small and narrow. I have a slender size 8.5 foot in almost every shoe I own. In these I got them on but they were so tight my toes were pushing out the front and red..  not pretty. I never have this problem. The shoe is very pretty but way small. I would have had to order at least a 9.5 and that was not available. Beware that if you choose to order go up a full size. No problem with return. It was free as long as you print out the label and drop at a UPS store.
I own many Nine West shoes and all fit me perfectly. I am a size 5.5 so it's rare that a heel without a strap will fit securely and comfortably. This pair was disappointing as the right shoe was stretched (it was probably a display somewhere) but both shoes slipped off my heel. The platform was also uncomfortable. Truly disappointed because this shoe is so cute! Returned.
I found these to run a little tight in the ball of the foot.
"these are the most awkward fitting underwear ever made, they constantly roll when you sit down and actually defeats the purpose of them.  I would not repurchase."
"Very confortable, fit as expected. But in a rainy day, they have soles slip"
"I float between a size 7 and 7.5. Ordered a 7.5 but apparently accidentally ordered a 7.5 W. So there's some extra room. Finish is pretty cheap looking, but the shoe is comfortable enough. Good enough for a cubicle job, but I doubt it will last if worn frequently."
Every one loves it.
Love the style however needed smaller size due to tiny waist and wide hips.
"Comfortable pants, however not addecuate for yoga."
"Fold creases in the material don't come out. Very thin, all poly cloth.  I won't buy them again."
"I really loved my boots when they arrived but after 4 to 5 months the one heel began peeling off - not cool at all. For being Clarks and the price, I would not recommend them."
"The jewelry box seems stable enough. However, you can see some of the glue. I will keep it. However, be aware that the quality and presentation is not the best."
"When I first got it, I was quite happy with the material and the fit. But with time and after one cold machine wash, each of them started to get bobbies all over them and then the fit became tighter. What followed next was appalling as one of the 3 came lose at the seams of the inner thighs. I was heading for an event at that point when I realized that the threads had come lose and there was a gaping hole in my tights. I quickly changed and I shudder to think of what could have been had I already been outside when this happened."
"They're nice, but the knitting is already coming apart."
"I've been wearing New Balance for years, but for running I was lucky enough to have the same style for 3 years before they canceled that shoe. I'm using these as a replacement The ultrasoft liner makes it feel like one is running in sand. And the sizing is different for every style NB puts out. I cannot figure out why I wear a 6.5 in one style and an 8 in another.

These are an adequate replacement, but not as good as the older style I used."
The shoes are able to go with anything and are especially good for the warmer parts of the year i.e. summer.
Beautiful coat!!!  I wear a size 10 but had to order a size 12.
"Buy a size larger. Light weight and good buy, but sleeves shrunk when washed as directed."
"Comfy but only for home. If worn outside for any length of time, arches and heel hurt badly."
"Watch itself is quite nice.  The band has an extra piece of fabric which attaches to the watch itself and does not allow for adjustment of the watch on the band.  This works ok for someone with a large wrist.  I have a small wrist so I ended up cutting this extra piece of fabric, sliding the watch to a different position on the band itself and then hooking the band.  This leaves about an inch and a half of extra band material to flap on my wrist. Watch itself is quite nice."
Not comfy but looked nice. Returned
"Thought they would be more comfortable and looked to have a lot of cushioning. However, they are a step below Ecco."
"The shirt itself is fine, but very short, these are chinese sizes ladies, they won't fit a normal American women. Get 2 sizes up at least and expect to wear high wasted bottoms to acheive the look that the model has otherwise the shirt won't work right."
"Not meant to be made in plus sizes. It fits, but the xxl i bought doesn't fit where it needs to. The hips come out in the wrong place and the chest isn't really made for a 42 E. So,  your breasts sit in a weird position."
Only comment is perhaps a thicker platform would improve comfort. Looks killer!!
"i ordered a size bigger like i read other people suggested and they fit good. i also got wide width or ""D"" ... i think it would have been too tight if i hadn't. they fit good front to back but there's extra room above the toes which feels weird. but better then being tight i guess. the arch support isn't great...i have really high arches and usually have this problem with shoes. so i think if i put a sole insert in i'd be good. the quality does seem a little lower then some other shoes but the price was right. over all pretty happy with them."
"Love how they offer an all black athletic shoe in a wide width that complies with the school uniform code.  My 6-year old said they were much more comfortable than the Stride Rite Hook and Loop Coopers that he had been wearing.  The shoe's tongue doesn't go up too high (previous Stride Rite shoe was hitting the top of his foot where it meets his ankle and bruising it).  I also like how it is lightweight.  Would have loved it more if it had lasted through more than 2 months of wear.  The stitching on the plastic tip at toe for both shoes started to come apart and soon enough, the fabric at the toes started to come apart as well creating a nice, big hole.  My son is hard on his shoes and has been wearing Stride Rite all his life but we have never had this happen to a pair of Stride Rite shoes (athletic, canvas, or leather).  I bought another pair of New Balance shoes because he said they were really comfortable, but this time I chose the all (synthetic?) leather kind and so far it has been holding up one month into wearing it.  Crossing my fingers this lasts through the end of the school year."
"Ok socks. 6-12 month size fit my 6 month old well. I didn't realize they came in a different color than pictured, I was disappointed about that. After just a few washes they look old and worn. He can't walk, so I'm not sure why they are so tattered."
great watch just wish it had more alarms its pretty easy to use the only 2 issues i have is the tempature gauge takes a while to give you and adequate reading i'm in iraq and i have to stand outside for about 15min to get a good read and some times the analog dials are in the way of reading the tempature besides that no real issues
Too tight for my husband. I had to return and re-order 2XLT.
"The socks themselves seem of great quality, but they're way too big. I bought a xs which, according to the sizing chart provided, should fit a child 2-4 years of age. They're way too big for my average-sized 3-year-old. I'll hold on to them for when she grows, but I still need socks that fit now."
"The materials are nothing special, and there is no arch support or padding inside the shoe.  I don't know how many performances they will make it through.

That said, I had a terrible time finding the right size. Since I really needed the shoes for a theatre production, I ordered three times, until I got the right fit.  I normally wear a size 6 1/2 or 7.  Since reviews of others of the same brand shoe indicated they ran pretty small, I thought a size 7.5 would be right.  They were way too big.  I ordered the 6.5, and they pinched my toes.  I then ordered the size 7.0 and got a pretty good fit, but had to put a foot pad in the bottom in order to get the fit just about right.  I spent a lot on shipping (which I knew i was doing), but did get refunds on the two sizes that didn't fit.  Just be forwarned--My foot is just a regular 6 1/2 medium, as a rule--not unusual--so if you need the shoes like I did, you might think about shopping wiser than I did."
If you have large hips or Buttox area .. it don't fit as good as it would if you purchased an xl from the store. The material is Definitaley comfortable.
"The tail lumped up the first time it was washed, the sleeves were a bit short and the whole thing is a bit short. The ankle cuffs ride up your calves. But it is wearable, and kids love it, especially with monster foot slippers in matching green, lol :)"
"I bought these bras shortly after I had my twins and started working on losing the baby weight.  They are now 7 months old and I'm training for a half marathon.  I've used these bras for all exercising I've done post pregnancy and they have been good, but this past weekend I did an 8 mile run and ran across my first problem with these bras..... I'll do my best to explain-

The part of the bra that provides support while the front is unclipped has a piece of fabric that runs down the center of your cleavage, between your breasts.  It felt fine for the whole 8 mile run, but when I jumped in the shower I realized the fabric had been chafing my skin on either side of my cleavage and had rubbed layers and layers of skin away...yowza!!!

I'll continue using these for exercise other than running, but will have to invest in a different bra for long runs!  - I followed the advice of other users and ordered a size smaller than recommended since everyone seemed to say they ran large, but ended up having to exchange my medium for a large (my other bras are 36Ds), which fits me great."
"returned..too small. my kidlet wears a 10 typically. tight around middle and arm holes seemed too snug.
fabric was nice and satiny..the flower bow/pin is removeable and was damaged when we recieved it."
Fell apart in a month. Definitely a lower quality than my husbands last pair which lasted over a year.
"It turns my wrist green and makes my wrist itch. :( I know it's not REAL gold, but I was hoping it would be a little better quality. It's a cute style though!"
True to size bed nice material but women with a larger bust ( I'm a 38D) it doesn't give any support to.
These run really small... really. I am a size 8.5 and these barely fit. Luckily they are just for pool/gym shower so I think I can deal.
I usually wear a small or a medium. I ordered a medium and the fit is perfect except the arms that are a little tight. I wear 32ddd and usually have problems fitting in the chest region. This shirt had enough stretch and looks good. The biggest complaint I have is the collar. It looks silly no matter how it lays. I need this shirt for an event this weekend otherwise I would probably return it. I don't think this shirt will last a long time either. There are random strings hanging from the buttons and the stitching does not seem like quality stitching.
"I love the concept, but it is flimsy and very thin.  much smaller than I thought t would be,  Buts its ok."
I like it as very warm but heels hurt the end rim while putting them on. Prob best for home without carpet.
"Somewhat large for specified size, but over all good quality."
"I am a woman who has large hands so it is difficult to find gloves that fit.  I usually buy men's gloves.  This pair was the right size for my hands but the light grey band area (between the glove and the ""cuff"") is not stretchy fabric so it was difficult to get the widest part of my hand through to put the glove on.  I liked the look and feel of the gloves and the thickness, but they just didn't fit for me so I had to return them and shop for a different style of 180's."
"Ordered a size up and it fit perfectly.
Does the job and recommend."
"It's basic sandals, it's very rubberyis. Just be careful with your balance because since the rubber is so stretchy I would kind of  lose balance to try to grasp my foot back in place especially when it's raining a bit when the sandals get wet.
No biggie but just throwing it out there lol."
"Kept my feet dry in a heavy rainstorm and in a flooded basement and the top buckles so my calves fit perfectly! Wouldn't given 5 stars BUT the shoe part fit awkwardly! It actually hurt the top of my feet (to the point that I kicked them off under the table!) and when I walked the ankle part gapped. I'm a size 22 in pants and require wide calf boots, but I've never needed wide shoes and never ran into this problem! If it hadn't been a stormy weekend and my basement flooring I'd have returned them."
"Way too big. Might fit next year. Not the cutest shorts in the world. A bit utilitarian, but I guess I should have expected that from Dickies."
"Some of the jewelry wasn't what I expected and is worthless to me. Half of it is great, the other half I'm not to sure what to do with, I bought it because it was cheaper then buying piece by piece."
"These shorts are OK, no better or worse. They are comfortable but a little tighter around the legs than my last pair (which I still have and wear). Also, the material is roughly half the weight of my older pair; almost dress shorts like material.

I am keeping them, but will not be purchasing another pair."
I feel these run a size small.
it's coveralls for work.
"Much brighter in color than I imagined though still attractive. Bugged a bit at my ankle.  The problem is the toe area was too long for my feet and was causing me to trip.  I returned them for a fast, no argument refund.  Was sad they didn't fit my feet."
"Too long of a dress with the fringe as I am on the shorter side. 5'3""."
"Lovely shirt, I would love to wear it but it is too small.  Other things in that size fit me well."
"I do like this shoe, but after wearing and walking in them for several hours they are SO tight I want to cry."
quite so so
The nightgown is cute but the sleeves are that scratchy tulle type of material that I think would be itchy for a lot of kids. I ordered a 4T because my 3 year old is almost to that size and this is just a bit smaller than I expected it to be compared to other 4T nightgowns we own.
A lot more intense with colors and beading than pix
Cute Set
"It's OK; not as sturdy as I expected.  The clear lid could be stronger too, but I'll use it."
THESE SHIRTS RUN SMAAAAALLL. That's the reason for the 3 stars. I ordered TWO sizes UP because I'd read that some people felt they ran small - - TRUST ME--THEY RUN SMALL... It makes me very disappointed that I have to worry about the buttons where my breasts are because they run so small...
I first bought this romper in burgundy/wine color loved it so much I ordered this casual green print one and also a black one. All of them held up fine except the green print. It ripped in the crotch area and on the sides. It fit perfectly even a little roomy. It wasn't stretched it just has weak stitching in that area :( I was disappointed because it's so comfortable and I love it.
These were prices well ($9) so for one-time wears they were okay but they shrunk BIG TIME even in cold war.  We got our intended use out of them- to wear when we went to see The Force Awakens- but it would have been nice to see them last.
Strong odor that eventually lessened over time.
"Very nice shoes but it is tight around the toe area, maybe the just need to be stretched out a bit. Other then that they are beautiful shoes"
"How about over your knee. They are very comfortable, but way way longer than expected."
I like the pattern of the socks. They don't have any annoying loose strings which is great.  I wear a size 6 shoe and the socks are thin enough to wear with flats.  They're not very stretchy though and I definitely have to give them an extra tug to get them over my heels.  If you wear a size 7 or larger I wouldn't suggest them.
"The material is good, but the fit is weird. If you try to tighten to fit your bust size, the hook part rides up, way up. It is also kind of loose under the bust in some areas."
crown came broken.
I ordered unisex size 8 and they were women size 10.  Quality of product overal was good.  Just suggest a more accurate sizing chart.
These earrings are very nice. They are very light but flimsy. I feel like they can break at any moment. So far they have not but I don't like the fact that I have to worry about it.
"Decent set of tools, but the jewelry is terrible. Not expecting a lot for the price though and was not disappointed. The jewelry is very cheap and the balls do not like to stay screwed on."
Fit is good but the shirt itself is of low quality. You will not use this shirt extensively because I suspect it will be beat after a few washings.
"Not in love with these, but will wear them for the comfort!!! I love Clarks:)
The service was fast and great:))"
I love the dress but the sleeves are very tight. Do not buy this dress unless you have very small arms.
"This shirt turned into an XS after the first wash (I washed it to get the smell off it when it arrived). It was very disappointing. The shirt was see-thru and when it was so tight, it was a bit unsettling."
Its very bunchy around the mid section - doesnt flow as well as the picture shows. I am 5'2 and 115lbs. Ordered the medium.
Shoe is pretty wide and also top of shoe is very inflexible and does not fit around fit well.  Part of the lack of fit is caused by how wide.
It was very beautiful and soft and lovely material. Unfortunately the upper part was way to small for me and the rest was almost too big. Very sad
They are okay but you get what you pay for. If you buy the expensive toe socks they are anywhere from 10 to 20 a pair. These are not the same quality but are great for the money spent. The run somewhat small.
"The stones started falling out after a couple months, but I still wear it because I like the fit."
Not at all true to size. Extremely tight across the bust.
"It doesn't fit guys way I'd like it to, but I can still wear it with a tank top or tee shirt. Definitely not something that will keep me warm, but still gorgeous."
these shoes are ok but really really pointy so much more than what they look like in the picture so there are onlyu a few outfits they work with for me.
"Seem like a nice quality, but they are not true to size. I have to return them, there's no level of comfort unless you go up at least a half size, but since I wear combat boots in the fall/winter with wool socks I'll probably go up a full size."
Did not give me the coverage I needed
Looked forego is but earrings broke right away so I returned the product. Gorgeous bracelet and necklace though!
"One pair fit great, so didn't bother to try on 2nd pair.  Had to shorten them a couple of inches so did that. Went to put the second pair on, and won't fit.....way too small, like a size or two. Can't send back as I have altered the pants.  Disappointed that there is a big difference in size between the 2 pairs."
"I like the extra height of this clog, but I need to wear thick socks in order to walk comfortably in these shoes.  After much deliberation, I will be returning the GZW Rhythm."
This will be great over a bathing suit. The black skirt is sheer.
"These fit well and served their purpose as part of a costume. However, they snag very easily. I wouldn't buy these again for me rough 8-year old."
Watch band requires special tools to resized.  Could not find a jeweler locally that had the tools to do it.
"Very, very pretty in a very quirky way; actually they're adorable. Sadly, their fit is a bit on the strange side.  They're longer then normal so the back slipped regardless of the thickness of a sock & the toe box runs very narrow-that pretty much elimates a thick sock.  I would've loved to have kept them but they were just not meant to be.....:>("
Arm holes to large and shoulders hang over. Great shirt for knock around at home.
Size runs small though still fits.  A nice blouse overall.
TOO LONG FOR THIS OLE GAL.
Material is jersey/polyester. Hence there is lots of stretch in the fabric and the waistband was too big. Gifted to a friend whose is 14/16 as I had already cut the tags.
"The ring was very small on my husbands finger and it's possibly my fault for not measuring correctly, it doesn't look like the picture which was disappointing to me because it looked much darker. I had to return it and amazon was very nice about it, I had my money back in my bank account a few days later."
"Sizes are difficult between manufactures and that why I try thing on when at a store before buying, except online. A course my first order was way to small.  Ended up reordering next size up and it fit OK.  Thankful for Amazon return policy otherwise I would give up with online clothing purchases."
Received correct seize but stretched too much after first wash.
"OK  for the price but they run SMALL and are not the buttery soft leather that some gloves are made of; supposedly made of Italian leather, but are made in China.  Description is mis-leading."
"Still love the shoes, this pair just a bit smaller than the others."
These wore out-- holes in the soles and color off the front within a few days of light wear. Very soft.
They don't keep the feet warm.
My girlfriend ordered this and she did not like it very much. It was cut a little above her ankle and the deep cut couldn't keep her 'girls' covered. Good thing she can sew and has an eye for fashion because she tailored the legs and the outcome was amazing. And as for the 'girls' I have no idea what she did but they stayed put. When ordering clothes it helps when you're handy with your hands.
Soles were too big on this brand so I decided to size down. Toe band was way too tight and not leather so there will be no extra give. Unfortunately did not fit my mother either who is a size 6. Cute shoe but I had to send back.
"very cute but my high foot would not go under the top, I thought these might have had a stretch top. It was not. had to send back :("
"Colors are much more vivid in photo. In real life they are rather dull. Long posts too, which makes them poke out the front even with backs screwed on tight. Not bad, but not great either."
"These shoes would have been comfortable except I was unable to wear them because the front part was too tight for my foot.  My feet tend to swell in the heat which makes it difficult to find a comfortable pair of shoes that will fit me.  They are attractive & the leather was soft.  They appeared to be well made.  Sadly, I had to return them as they would not fit my foot."
"...look for a cheaper kit - there's no way a cheaper one could be any more poorly made.  I should have gone with a $7.95 version.

That said, I managed to resize a few bracelets today pretty easily and there's no way I could have done it safely without the pin-push tools in this kit.  There some sort of blue ""jig"" in the kit that has a pin push on it, but the blue crank was broken right out of the box - super glue is holding it so far, but I don't think that's a loss as it is otherwise useless other than the slots for supporting a band where you use the ""manual"" pin removers.  There's no rubber hammer like some kits, so I used the case wrench, lazily, as a hammer and it worked fine.

If you are careful and patient and plan you work, you can do this without scratching the bracelet.  I used some thin clear plastic between the band and the tool to protect it - scotch tape might also work and painters tape for other areas of the watch is also not a bad idea.  I also used the flat handle end of the tweezers to re-seat the pins flush - putting it on top of the pins and hammering it rather than the pins directly; this along with the tape and clear plastic shields the bracelet from the hammer.

The spring bar remover is handy too for changing straps / bracelets and works well enough.  The case tools I don't plan to use since my watches require water sealing.  So, 3 stars in spite of how rinky-dink it is.

I thought about spending more for some quality tools, but this stuff gets the job done well enough - and I probably could have gotten by with an even cheaper kit.

Update: the super glue (Loctite brand = good stuff) is continuing to hold - to may amazement - and I have used that little blue pin remover tool a few times now.  If the glue breaks, I'll look for a more rugged version because it is handy."
i have had many crocs did not care for these to large same size as my others i have
"I like the watch, but it broke in 2 months. The small turn-dial fell out rendering the time-keeping useless. Watch has been durable and the strap wears down to a dark brown quite nicely. I'll probably buy another though"
I was hoping for more of a hot pink than a bubble gum pink.
"These were tight on my son. If he had skinny legs, they would be great but he has wide feet and bigger calves. The socks didn't ""give"" a lot and were too tight."
Sz 11 and kinda small on the calf area. Need to put in insoles or something. Kinda like walking barefeet. Nice color though.
it rolls down
Not overly plush or luxurious but I see one can spend 3 or 4 times what this one cost - so I imagine when you do that you get plush and luxurious.
"Not really sure what this ring is actually made of. Although it claims to be titanium, it's probably mostly aluminum. It scratches extremely easy. Bought it as a ring to use working out or cleaning but really don't think it will last long."
"It is cute. I'm going to return it.  I am torn between keeping it. It fits, but I really had to shimmy into it. I am an 8/10 US and I could barely get it over my hips.  I am afraid that I will rip a seam as I move to get dressed quickly in the busy mornings.  It is cute. The fabric has a sheen to it, most likely you will need to press it or have it done at the cleaners.  I have to take care of every body else these days so I'm in to what ever is easy for me. I do like that it makes quite a statement and I am second guessing the return."
Very comfortable to wear and decent looking fabric.
"My daughter is a size 7, going towards 8 so I had a hard time deciding what size to get her. She has normal width foot. Opted for the 8-9 figuring she'd grow into them even if they didn't fit great right now and I hate returning things.  They were huge on her, probably won't wear until the end of next season, even thought Crocs are forgiving. The fact that they are sandals and not clog type crocs makes them less forgiving.  Cute shoes, I like the protected toe and that they are cooler than regular crocs in summer.  This was my bad, just thought this info might help someone else.  I'm neutral on the rating as my daughter can't wear them yet and can't give an opinion."
"This is a great bra, except the band is so tight i could barely breath. I'm not sure that it will loosen up. I'm disappointed to say the least."
"With my prescription glasses on, the so-called LensCovers didn't fit over very well. The result is the LensCovers stand out from my face so much that I can insert 4 fingers between my cheek and the lens. Even without my prescription glasses, the LensCover stands away from my face. I'll wear em but I really don't like em. Too much trouble to send them back."
"i don't like, the material"
I hate the sleeves of this jacket and the seems come undone easily. Other than that... A lightweight water resistant outer shell.
Very small for a one size garment.
"Just ok for the price.  Not high quality material.  Fit is ok, not excellent."
Appear to run small and had a seam around the ankle that bothered me. Gave to my daughter - she seems to like
Absolutely NO arch support so wearing them more than about 2 hours is very uncomfortable.  Otherwise the interior and exterior material is nice and the seams do not dig into the foot as other brands do.  I won't recommend unless you have flat feet and don't want arch support.
"This jacket is alright. it's very warm & comfortable, although it came in wrinkled but in excellent condition (new). But lets get to the point. For those who are wondering about this jacket...

First of all, the packaging was horrible. Amazon packed mine's in a thin flimsy cheap brown cardboard box with just a thin clear tape, even a 5 year old kid can rip the box open. yea, i was a bit disappointed with that cus who knows?? someone could've tear the box open & stole my order easily. 2nd; i've notice the little ""classic red tab styling"" on the left side of the front chest pocket did not have that ""LEVI"" logo on it like it was described above, instead, mine's had a letter 'R inside a circle' emblem on the red tab, but when i checked back here and zoomed in with the magnifier, i've notice it says LEVI on it. i've bought a Dark Rinse so if you select that color & zoom in with the magnifier you will see that it says ""LEVI"" on the little red tab on the side of the left front chest pocket & if you zoom in on the other color (worn out), you will see it will have that letter R inside a circle on the red tab. for some of us it's not a big deal, but you know, how would you feel or like it if someone actually notices it & say to you: ""that's not Levi's, that's a cheap knock-off denim jacket"". it's why i gave it 3 stars. i bought this jacket here online because i can't find no jacket similar to this Levi's denim with the cotton collar anywhere at my local mall or outlet, & if there was any, my size would be either limited or sold out! (sorry for the long review)"
"Because I wanted an oversized shirt to wear with leggings, I got an XL. In shirts, I typically will wear a Large or Extra Large anyway, depending on the style.  I wear a size 10/12 jeans and I'm 5'3"".

The shirt is ENORMOUS and fits like a dress.  I'm swimming in it.  I like oversized things but it looks like I'm a kid playing dress-up in my mother's clothing.  It's hard to see the black stripes on the sleeves and the wrist portion is very tight.

I will add a picture soon so you can all see how it looks.  I'll add two: one with leggings and one wearing jeans.

Don't get me wrong: the shirt is comfortable and quite think but way bigger than I imagined.  I think my husband and I can both wear it at the same time.  That might make an interesting third picture.  I'll see how it goes."
cute addition to my collection
I have a small head so this hat was a little large and deep on me.  Though I do like that the sakkas hats are adjustable sizing by pulling an elastic cord on the inside it was way to deep for my head.
Itchier than I had hoped but also my nipples are very sensitive from breastfeeding. Get what you pay for. Ended up investing in a more expensive q quality bra
"Arrived with tag ""medium"" and definitely was not a one size fits most. Fit my tween tho.forearm cuffs are very tightly woven with no give room for stretch. Strong tar-like odor. Deep rich yellow color tho."
"I love the color and design, only bad thing is the card slots are small and if you fill the wallet up with cards it's hard to close."
This Shoe is too narrow. I am disapointed with it.
"Well made, and very basic. IMHO, nothing special and a bit pricey, given it had two compartments. It was returned."
Love the style of this shoe but the fit did not work well for me!
I was expecting to be a little bettter.
"It's ok, but wasn't quite the look I was going for.  Looks more like a mini skirt over leggings than an extension of my shirt, even when I matched the colors together."
I had to order this one when a previous order never showed up.  The case is small and the leather is very thin.  It feels a little cheap.  My son wanted one and this one is good enough for him but I feel the price is a bit high for the quality.
Great quality costume! The fit is a little off. The top is small and tight and the skirt is large and loose. I'm 5'2 180lbs. I got a large.
Came with a huge hole in the side. Had to Stitch it myself. But all in all. Super cute and sexy.
I am so used to other sleeveless onsie brands being too small that when one runs true to size I think it is to big. Buy these the current size that your child wears.
"Deep long sigh. These are NOT leather. That's sooooo very frustrating when items are mis-described. I would NOT have ordered these if the description was correct -- ALL MAN MATERIAL is stamped on the inside and upon opening, the faux leather smell or glue hit my nose immediately leading me to check the inner label. Well, that and the PVC look of the embossed ""leather"" - it looks cheap and is it feels hard. I ordered 8.5 but could've gone with an 8. And it feels like PVC on the foot - hard & not pliable. I'm not a sneaker head, I'm a heels chic - these were for those non-heel occasions (amusement parks, etc) yet wanting to be cute in sneakers. Shrugs - these may go back despite cute factor. The material doesn't breathe or bend so likely will be uncomfy as a casual option for amusement parks, etc."
"Again comfort issue, maybe Patagonia should look into this, both shoes purchased have same issue."
"decent material, timely delivery, but contrary to the picture, the shirt is NOT yellow.  The actual product it is unmistakably orange."
"Band fit too loose, cup was far too small. Disappointed, as I usually love Panache."
These are inexpensive and fairly good fitting.  They do kind of stretch out a bit while wearing and ride lower than I would expect.
this should be advertised as scrubs. thats how the material is.
It's just an ok shoe. I returned them because my whole body ached after wearing for 1 day.
"I have these in black and love them.  I don't remember having to ""break them in"" as I am doing with this pair, now.  Wore them to a museum and was limping after about an hour.  Will need to wear them around the house to gradually be comfortable in them."
"I refer to these as my ""North Carolina"" boots because they are cute but don't do much to keep my feet warm. The bottom sole is so thin, the cold ground makes my feet freeze if it is at all chilly outside. I couldn't wear them *at all* in Michigan.

On the other hand, if you are in a climate where temperature is not really a concern for you, and you just want some fashionable boots on the cheap, these will do the trick. Just don't plan on walking long distances in them, or maybe get some Dr. Scholl's inserts or something."
"With this product you get what you pay for; the material isn't the greatest and I'm sure it won't last past a few wears, but it's a good price and it worked really well as a quick, easy, and fun Halloween costume.  I'm 5' 2"" & about 140lbs and the children's large was big enough to fit me with quite a bit of extra room.  The robe itself ended about 3 inches below my knees, though that's to be expected as it's made for kids."
"It has nice BIG letters and numbers, something important to us who are 70+. This is accomplished by leaving off the clutter of other Casios. Wish the light were as bright as on other Casios. You can't beat the price, but I would pay more for a more substantial case and watchband."
Replacing a pair and these seem tighter in the thong area. Super light and will keep but would not get these a second time.
Right shoe fit odd. Dug into my ankle. Plus shoes were a little loose.
"They are a little larger than I would prefer.  I bought them to wear with a particular outfit on my recent 5-day cruise.  Although I got complements on how I looked that evening, no one commented on the earrings specifically.  The earrings did complete my look.  I am not sure how often I will be wearing them because of their size.  They are a very nice quality and I like the lever backs."
They hurt my daughters feet. She was disappointed.
"Not terribly comfortable, but okay."
"I got the size 32 as my bra size is 30D / 32C. The rib cage circumference (the elastic that goes under the boobs) is a bit too large for me, while the boobs part (the main bit) is a little small. Because of this, these bras are not at all supportive for me so I only wear them when I am lounging around the house or sleeping. I think these would fit great on a 34A or 34B - basically someone with a smaller difference between the rib cage and bust measurements.
Quality-wise, they are good. Good stitching, soft fabric."
I think the quality could be better look cheap!
Nice knee highs but somewhat tight at the top.
"Its a cute dress... the frills on the bottom are very nice and feel soft . The fabric on top is cotton and is soft on kids body.
But the lace torn of on few uses.. ie it tore from one place... so giving two stars
Listing down pros and cons :
Pros:
Its really a cute outfit
The color combinations of the skirts are good, vibrant colors .
the bow on top adds a nice touch
Cons
The cotton on top and the net on the bottom does not go well together. It would have been better if it was some satiny material for the top as well
The frill are net and hence they run the risk of getting torn pretty easily
as its for kids the material could have been better quality so that it can be worn at least a couple of times"
"They are ok, decent price for the pack"
"Solid socks at first, but the gel that keeps it to the back of your foot gets worn out very quickly. the socks constantly fall off the back of my foot and bunch up inside my shoe."
One shoulder strap twisted. Unable to fix. Returned.
"I absolutely loved this dress upon taking it out of the box. The light blue is stunning and the white detail so so subtle and pretty. However, after putting it on, I immediately regretted buying it. The dress runs much too large and has unflattering excess garment around the stomach. Very disappointed and returned the dress."
"CRAZY long for a pencil skirt, although that may be due to my being on the shorter size"
I love the fit and look of this boot as far as the look of the fit. I don't like that it doesn't look like real leather and that is my fault for not fully researching before I purchased. Other than that I would have given it 5 stars.
But gave to my little neice and she loved it.  Loved shopping on this site and will look forward to more
"Since I got this shirt to play golf in the colder weather I was disappointed that the sleeves were a little tight just below the elbow  I have just average size forearms, so I was disappointed that my arms felt a little constrained"
One of them already broke
Beware of sizing.  XL is more Like a large so size up
This ring was smaller in stone size.  The band of ring very thin.  I probably will give to Granddaughter .  Sorry just disappointed .
I ordered medium because my small scrub pants are getting a little tight in legs. These pants are huge! My fianc who is 250#+ can wear them. I will be sending them back to get smalls.
"Nice and soft, but does not work as a bath robe as the material does NOT absorb water as well as a cotton robe would.  Works better as a house robe."
Kind of big because I wear 8.5 shoes
Size seems to be larger than should be.
"too large for regular size 7 girl. some people said these shoes run small but everyone's size is different so I ordered size 7.
however, they are way too big for me. it's not big because the shoes are long its big because of the rubber band part is too loose.
the band is too loose that it doesn't support my ankle.
it doesn't look pretty it looks cheap and looks like what you get at 5 below

 01/12/2018 edited.

I was very upset when I received this item so I gave 1 star and a very upset/ bad review however if you order a right size this shoes aren't too bad. Its actually somewhat cute and very good on medium/dark skin girls out there.
Im my case I wear 7 for running shoes, heals I wear size 6-6.5. In cause your curious."
could just be because im bigger but it fits kinda tighter not as flowy as the picture on me it just looks like a regular black tank top with a cross on it
Very comfy but hasn't lasted.  
The bag is beautiful but within a week the leather of the handle starts to tear where it was stitched to the bag. The way it was stitched creates a perforation that weakens the leather of the handle and allows it to tear. I had to stop using it because the handle is about to snap apart. :( Otherwise the bag is lovely.
"I ordered this dress during cyber Monday deals week because it was on special - but when i got it , it was shorter than expected & slight see thru, so i will attempt to try it on again with my one piece bodycontrol slip & see if that helps ! if not i will be returning it"
"IT LOOKED BETTER ON MY DAUGHTER IT WAS TOO SMALL ,"
"I usually wear a 41. This was probably an inch smaller than my other Naot's. I would buy two sizes up if I were to get it again. That said, I was sad because it was very pretty and I had to send it back."
They fit me.
"I like this, but have yet to wear it out. Every time I put it on I feel like it makes me looker bulkier than if I just had my clothes on without it. Yes, it holds everything in and is tight and supportive, but I feel like it makes me look boxy. It also pushes your boobs up and makes them weirdly shaped like they are resting on something. I am not a large busted girl either. I usually pull it down so it does not appear that way, but it eventually rides up. Plus, I put it on under a fitted shirt and you could see the hook and eyes in the front. Kind of bummed. I may just wear it workout in because it is hot and makes you sweat."
"Great color, great material.  I recommend you order a size down from your usual.  I'm usually a medium, but with this style/brand I seem to have needed a small."
"We purchased this ring for my mechanic husband. He wanted it so if he were to have his hand pinched or crushed, it would flex, and not fold into his finger. It would have done exactly as we wanted, however it is very flimsy and the links wallowed out quickly and stretched and no longer fit properly after a few weeks."
I found the calves a little snug....I think they will relax over time.  Also I am going to take them to have the heels replaced as these are such a hard plastic....I hate the clacking sound as I walk.
"Nice quality But much thinner than I expected,like see through thin So better suited to be worn under something rather than all on its own."
"Although I purchased a wide size, they were still too narrow. The color, fabric is beautiful and I was disappointed that they didn't work for me.  I gave them to my daughter and she wears them regularly, so they are still a success."
"Narrow-footed sisters, rejoice. These are the shoes for you. My feet are fairly reliably a 9W in most brands, so that's what I ordered, and I found these to be much narrower than expected as well as somewhat shorter. They are gorgeous shoes, but I wanted them to be comfortable and with the width of my foot overhanging the sole by a good half-inch on either side, not so much. It's possible that with narrower feet the length might not feel too short, so I can't tell you unequivocally to order a half size up, but I can tell you that on my feet, the 9W felt a lot more like an 8.5M. Happy shopping! Thanks to amazon for a great return policy."
I ordered these and had to send them back.  The left shoe was much bigger than the right shoe.  I lost money on these because they keep your shipping money and you have to pay yourself to send back.
"I originally purchased these because of the jersey material, which I love because it's soft.  The slippers have much too large of an instep to wear comfortably and it feels like it's going to fall off.  Then, the heel started peeling up after a month. Not really pleased with them and definitely would not purchase again."
Cute but above knee at 5'3
A good costume but have to make some fixing the gloves they have 2 fingers stick together by heat. But overall is a good costume
"Even though it states in the product description that colors may vary, I was disappointed  that the color scheme was not as pictured.  Sometimes the colors in the photos are accurate, and sometimes they are not. The only way we know, is to purchase the item. So I hope this review will help people in the future.
In the photo the color around the watch that looks pastel pink is more of a deep, magenta pink and there is no purple at all....so the actual colors are a deep pink, orange, yellow and blue, NOT pastel pink, purple, yellow and blue as pictured.
Also, The watch face is also bigger than it appears, it is 1 1/2 inches.  All of this info should be provided in the description. If it were, I am sure it would prevent a lot of disappointment and returns if it were given.
Since  the watch only cost $5.55, it is not worth returning.  It is not unattractive, it is just not the colors as pictured. I will probably give it as a gift."
"This skirt is cute but the waist on it missed the mark. They should have used a bigger elastic, with all the tulle it makes the waist area look bulky"
"I gave it 3 stars because the shirt is made of a nice material. However, Its not long as pictured. It comes to your waist like a regular t-shirt does. And it runs a little on the small size, So order one size up. Otherwise, Its a nice shirt, I will wear it with some jeans...."
I ordered these for overnight potty training and they don't make any more of a difference than regular underpants. They don't prevent the bed/pjs from getting wet.
I returned them. I could not wear them.  They did not conform to my odd foot size! It was not the fault of the shoe.
"The arch is not in the right place for my foot - perhaps it is okay for someone else.  And when I walk there is a noise of the flattened air between my foot and the shoe (not pc) with each step.  Would have returned, but I was one day too late on return policy - my fault."
"I bought this for my daughter and it is cute but it is really big. There is no way that it would stay on an infant. My daughter is 2 1/2years old and it's still to big for her. Also the flower doesn't look as full in person. For the price I still like it and she'll grow into it but do not buy this for an infant, you'll be wasting your money because it won't fit."
"This is a nice necklace but considerably thicker than I expected. Besides being somewhat obtrusive when I wear it, some of my pendants can't fit on it."
These are very nice shoes but they just run very narrow & small. Order 1 size up if you have even a med width foot
"I expected the material to be of better quality, instead it feels flimsy and cheap. The neck has a lot of space even though i ordered according to my weight. I weigh 176 and i ordered a size L"
The material is really flimsy when compared with my older scrubs. I'd rather pay more for better quality.
Debating if I should keep it for when he's bigger (9 weeks right now). No size adjustment other than stretch and I don't like the velcro on the chin strap. Material and construction seem good. I need a sun hat since he's too young for sun screen. By the time this fits he may not need it.
It does fit a little tight. I am normally a 44 DD but I am guessing after several washes it'll be fine.
"these fit like slims - I sent back and ordered huskies, which were too big - so difficult fit"
Very poor support for my feet.
"Not a perfect fit. For some reason there is a ""bubble"" right by the waistline, and the material is too warm to wear on a summer day."
"I ordered the small and it was way too small for me.  I'm 5'7, 130 lbs and  I could barely get them on.  Probably won't try another size... I didn't love the material."
So cute that I know most 6-10 year old girls would love it.  So cheaply made I know it will fall apart / break at any moment.
"Runs small. Not as padded as I thought they would be and I ordered size 2, thinking my grandson who where's size one would have grow room, not the case."
"Nothing great about these leggings, the material could have been better quality. I returned them."
I LIKED THESE SHOES UNTIL I HAD FOUGHT WITH THE STRETCH TIES FOR OVER AN HOUR SO GET THESE SET UP
It's VERY SMALL
"Good layering top ..... pricing is a good value.  As expected, lots of stretch in the material. Colors not as muted as shown in catalog, but more vivid and bright."
i always like clark shoes
"The material wasn't as I expected and I quickly got holes in the toes on two pairs out of six purchased. I would have preferred a softer material and better reinforcement. Also, I have an average foot and think ankle and this was fairly tight around the ankle area."
Size and fit not compatable
These leggings isn't shiny I brought the leggings because of the display pic and because of some of the feedbacks but everyone shape isn't the same. If your like me with some junk in your trunk with a small waistline these leggings wil fit you loose around your waistline.  I'm 5'1 5'2 is short they fit loose around my knees also around my ankle. I would not buy another pair of these leggings.
"I'm a 33-24 waist and ordered an XL.  The fit around my waist is fine.  The pouch, however, is too small.  The fabric color and feel is fantastic.  If they manufacturer would make the pouch a little bigger, it would be great."
"My fathers foot was swollen due to surgery.
We picked this shoe because he was needing something easy to slip on. Was sad because the velcro did not  come down far enough to accomedate his swollen foot. The strap was severely short and would not come near to closing. Great looking shoe, great company, just didn't meet our need. Would love to see a simalar shooe with longer strap from Propet!"
I love the product also the color. I gave 3 stars because after 2 months the holding pin broke. Good
Contrast in daylight is poor. Works OK at night. The strap is fabric of some kind and stays wet for some time. Amazon used to have a very good assortment of Timex watches. Now every time I check there are leftovers. Batteries last less than a year and it's nearly impossible to replace them with the compression back as this one has.
"I was hoping this shoe would be similar to the Clark Privo. It had zero support. Felt like a cheap slipper. It looked okay, but I need better support for my arches. I returned them. On a positive note, the seller responded immediately when I requested the return!"
"well, this skirt i order size 2X, according to there chart is about 20W, my size is  XL or 18W, I order bigger to fit loose, but it fits like 16W-18W, tight, material very thin ,just little stretchy, for my 165 cm is to long, so i had to cut , but not bother me, so good enough to keep,
resolt-  price to high for this quality"
"Not impressed at all not much support. Won't buy again. They look like they've been glued together
The Molokini Montrail much better hands down."
"Wish the hardware was silver not brass. Slightly tight in the arms and thin material. I'm 5'2"" and 105 lbs and got an xs. This will do the job which is just needing a plain basic leather jacket to throw on over my club dresses when it's cold"
Provides nothing new over any other pair of slippers I've ever owned.
"I bought this dress to wear to work and because the material is stretchy and see through it is inappropriate. It was too tight for me and not flattering. However, if you are thin and need a dress for a night out I think it would be nice."
I bought these before I was pregnant in a medium. I am now 8 months pregnant and they still fit. They're huge and not super flattering. But comfortable.
"These were way too large/wide for my feet, so I sent them back. Pity, because they were super cute shoes."
"Didn't last very long, back to black Dr. Scholl's diabetic socks"
I wear a size 11 so this is the review for that. The knitted fabric on the top is really soft and has a sleeve for in between your toes making them comfortable but the ankle straps are really short so you'll need to affix it in the last hole and slide it carefully over your heel relying on the elastic to stretch and not break. They ARE comfy once they're on but you have to be careful putting them on. And the straps tend to twist since you're sliding them on not buckling them on so you might have to adjust them some so they're straight.
Not as good as the old style with the little zipper compartment but it will do.
"I like these, but they are a little tight and short for me.  These are definitely junior size.  I typically wear a medium, so that is what I ordered.  They do fit, but are a bit tight to wear out in public.  The fabric is soft and thick (can't see through these like a lot of yellow colors), so I like that.  I will wear them around the house."
wayyyyyyy to short when i put it on it shows your panties i thought it was gonna be up too at least my tights but i should of known so it was kind of my fault.. but i will try to wear this with pants under
"This is by far the best-looking fabric espadrilles I've ever seen. The shantung fabric looks upscale, and the red is actually a very rich scarlet, so it looks so classy. Yet it is narrow and the toe part hurts. My toes were hurt so bad they almost bled."
They run small. I normally wear a size 12. Even the 14-16 was tight. I sent them back.
"has a nice color, yet to narrow"
"I loved the look of suede (waterproof!), but wasn't impressed with the quality of the smooth leather.  It looked too much like vinyl, so I sent them back."
Not cut very well.
"They are great! Do not bother me, I can wear them in the shower or when I sleep. All day use and super cute! It was just a pain to put on! They are very difficult to latch and needed help it took a good 30 minutes to put them in"
"It seemed like ok material but I was just absolutely swimming in it.  I returned it.

As reference I am a 5' 11"" woman who usually wears a medium.  But often the sleeves are too short.  These were too long.  I couldn't even see my hands."
"The fingers for these gloves do not fit that well. Especially since you can only touch with the index finger. Many of my devices do not respond well to the isotoner touch of these gloves since it is a small patch on the index finger.

As a basic glove this item is fine."
Cute boot but not warm like some of the other brands.
"The skirt is very thin, the material is not high quality by any means and the black is more of a grey/navy"
"The fit is fine and the quality is as I would expect of Keen's, however the photo appears that there is a Velcro fastening but there is no making it very difficult to get them on or off when they get wet.  We spend our weekends on the lake these were intended for water shoes so this is very annoying."
"Lenses are thinner. They fit fine. I won't rely on them for ballistic protection the way I relied on the old ones. Not going to risk a weapon malfunction and end up with the charging handle in my eye socket. They are polarized. You can tell by looking at your phone screen or some window tint. Good enough, but that's it."
"First, this is an excellent boot.  The material, construction and stitching are all top notch.  Despite the leather, and thick sole, it is not heavy.  They will not wear you out pursuing upland game birds.  My only issue was the area from the ankle to the heel was too lose.  Normally I wear a size 10.5 D.  Other reviews indicated the boot fit on the large size.  So I ordered a size 10.5, and a size 10.  Unfortunately I returned both.  Despite heavier socks, and tightening the front strap down to the last hole, I could not stop movement of my ankle/heel.  Avoiding an ankle sprain is essential when I'm miles away from the nearest road.  I loved the boots, but I had to return them."
"Pretty skirt though very sheer plus sizing is way smaller then ""American clothing""."
"the 2xl fit more like a Large.  Way too small.  Also, this is made of very thin spandex type material"
not enough arch support
"I'm returning this set. There was a seam coming open on the top of the large case by the handle even though it was obviously brand new luggage. I found that quite concerning. The wheels are top quality and the pull handles felt secure.  The fabric looks mid-grade -- not cheap but not ballistic nylon either.  I just feel that it's only marginally better than sets that are half the price. I'm opting to spend a bit more and get something that is ballistic nylon so it will (hopefully) last longer than the last set which was ""Bass"" branded, almost identical to this one (might even be the same manufacturer), and half the price.  The fabric has been what has worn on that set."
The elastic is pretty powerful. Lol. I know that sounds crazy but I don't like it so tight.
"Great tight fitting ends, the strap is not well connected to the gripping ends.  This connection will fail with a moderate pull.  I have developed a system of re-gluing the ends because of the persistent failure of this connection.
A well engineered product, nice in appearance, good overall quality.  WHY SUCH A WEAK STRAP TO CONNECTOR POINT."
Fits well. I am small in bathing suits and I ordered the small. Fits fine. But the scallop does fold down a little on the top. Wondering how it will fair once it gets wet.
"my wife bought these for my son, I don't really care for them. She ordered them on the large size for wearing in the near future. They seem larger than expected, maybe that's just my perspective. These type of shoes aren't really my cup of tea. They aren't of any exceptional level of quality and aren't very easy to get on and off. I don't like them myself so I won't be too harsh."
Stay away from bushes and stucco houses...the slightest rub against anything not smooth will deflate your jet pack in a heartbeat and your kids smile when he realizes his wings are floppy!
This was a last minute purchase for a halloween costume...is was very small but worked as a one time use type of thing.  My very thin 12 yr old wore it and it was snug on her bum and the jacket was short.  Overall not bad but not something that would hold up to a lot of wear and tear.
30 length is like a 32.  Some styles and colors of  Levi's 30 lengths are longer than others.
"I was looking for a comfortable slipper to wear around the house that hugs my foot and has a hard sole--going barefoot hurts my feet. Fit Kicks have both characteristics, and are okay for a short period of time. I was hoping to wear them with socks for warmth, but they are quite tight. All in all, a nice product but not quite right for me."
"Nice looking but my very wide feet slosh around in there even with thick socks.

Also, after wearing about 30x, the bottoms are very worn and have almost no traction."
These pants seem a bit smaller than expected. The material also feels strange to me. Less like cloth and more like woven plastic.
"It broke within two days of buying it.  Looks great, but the little rings holding it all together are weak."
"A little larger than expected, and the ""free"" goggles broke the first day. The suit seems to be a good quality though."
"I got them in the animal prints and they arrived promptly. I love the prints, but I gave them away because I prefer cotton socks. The price is very affordable."
"The color I ordered (BROWN) was noticeably lighter than expected, and it did not have the shiny look as it appeared in the photo. It's comfortable but, if you're a ""sweater"", the lighter brown color emphasizes that fact."
They were really too stretchy and lost their shape right away. I would not buy relaxed fit again.
This mask looks plastic up close.  ok for the price.
"Fits & feels great. I would prefer a more sturdy material though. A bit thin, so the support was not as nice as other brands I've bought."
"I love Seychelles and they usually run a little big, if anything.  These wedges are super cute, but I ordered my usual size and they were just to small, a little short and too narrow in the toe box.  If you have wider feet I would pick a different style."
"colors pretty, but underarm fits ackward."
"Bought these for a friend, they're very nice but runs very small. Great work or for outing, my friend loves it"
thought they were expensive. they run bigger than the size. They have stretch and give lots of room. Great for plus size women who want a slim look.
"Beautiful color, was expecting a different material but it will work"
"Like the look, the cut was off."
Its a nice coat.  But its a lil small for 18-24mnths. My son won't be wearing it long.but it good for now.
"I went on the general recommendation that I should buy a couple of larger sizes than I would normally wear. The material is thin, but if you have lumps, bumps and cellulite, no size will do it for you.  I'm exchanging this one for a smaller size.  It is attractive."
"When I tried these shoes on & walked in them inside the house, they felt comfortable. However, when I wore them to work (I work in retail cosmetics), they became a bit uncomfortable to stand in & both sides of each shoe were rubbing on both sides of my feet causing me to blister on one side, so although I didn't think they were too narrow when I first walked in them, they actually are. I have medium-width feet/ true size 7 & can fit most size 7 shoes perfectly fine. Also... This may be an odd observation, but I also felt like I was standing in a tilted forward position when wearing these, which I didn't mind, but just never owned heels that did that.

I wish I wore them a bit more in the house before wearing them out because now I'm not able to return them."
The design and quality of this is perfect for any fihssh enthusiast. My sone absolutely loves it. If it can stand up up to what my boys put it through then it's well worth it in my opinion. The clors absolutely pop! And its easy to  attach also. We bought three different ones and so far I have no complaints. No tarnishing or discoloration after 3 months.
"The dress is beautifull, the problem is with the size chart. Had to return it."
"Jeez guys.....ordered my 70yr old husband the tasteful shades of BLUE, received BRIGHT RED, BRIGHT GREEN, BRIGHT BLUE,and two of the shades of soft blue that I had specifically ordered......"
My son loves the pants!! His friends wants to know where he brought them from. I just wish it didn't take so long to ship
I like the bright colors which make it easy to find your bag. However when you are putting it on your suitcase it is hard to slide the buckle tight.
"I liked it, however I ordered another sweater from them that had a thicker quality.  The
PattyBoutik Women's Wool Blend Hooded Cable Cardigan is much thicker."
"In my search for the perfect NB shoe since they discontinued MY perfect fit NB shoe, so I tried this one. This provides support for sure. However, it really inflamed my plantar fasciitis that was under control, and it left my knee hurting (that I injured 9 months ago). So, while they fit around the foot, for ME, there is something in the bottom of the shoe I think that is not working for MY feet. I'm going to try a different insole to see if that helps. Now, I will also add that I was standing for 7-8 hours and did about 8000 steps in them, but I think it was more of the standing that cause the issue. My fee still hurt even in the morning but after several hours they felt normal again. So, they might work for you they might not. They fit my wide feet great, they just left my feet and knee hurting after long standing period and many steps."
The sandal is cute and comfortable.  The red color goes with a lot.
"Very cute- needed for a bachelorette party but someone ended up buying us all the same skirt.  Fits well, is a little sheer but fabric isn't exactly light and airy.  Would not recommend for humid locales."
"The dress is beautiful,  but the Bobby pin wasn't that peppa pig,  is a flower like purple and pink. I expect both products like I see"
Smaller than the what the product stated.
It's a large shirt and logo is pretty generic
thin but does the job
"While I loved these shoes, it could be the last pair of Clarks I putchase. Let me explain.

The shoes are a beauty. The perfect balance between form and function. I bought the tan / sided shoe. After getting them worn in, they quickly became my most comfortable and loved boots. I want to say I paid around $200 for these boots in the store, so a short while into owning them, I was pretty happy. Then come maybe month 6. The toe had this little indention that always pops back out. I took a spoon and tried to press it out, but it just pops back in. So I look like an old hobo. Lol.

Then, and the reason why I will likely not purchase another shoe from clarkes. The entire inside of one of the shoes began to come out. I mean, I'd pull my foot out and the red lining and heel cup would come with me. I took it to the store and was told by a guy that worked there ""sorry, there isn't anything we can do, you maybe would take it to a shoe repair store?""

Yea, I figured that I could do that, I don't need some kid to tell me that. I just need my favorite shoes to work.

What made me so angry isn't that my shoes started to come undone, it's that the store is so unable or unwilling to do something about a shoe that clearly either had a flaw or was poorly made. I don't know.  They looked great, but surely won't last."
Great for the price just what my mad scientist needed!
It's nice but I found string caught on one of the stones that I couldn't get out. I returned it because I felt a little color would have been better.
Adorable but  ran about 1 size smaller.. Not much support for the larger chested... And the quality was aweful... Very cheap materiel... Seams not sewn.. A real let down. I would not reccomend
"I have purchased Dearfoams slippers before, and always the same size - for some reason, these are a bit too small. But, I have had them for a few weeks, and they've stretched out a bit, which is good. These are a good overall slipper. Well made, good sole and a very squishy memory foam insole."
Didn't fit me I'm to small so I gave it to my momma
"I'm 5'2"", maybe that's why it looks so big on me-definitely not like the picture. The lower part reaches to my knees and the upper right under my chest area"
"Runs small, I own another hawk & co. Anorak, I got the same size small as this one, but that one very roomy, not like this one like slim fit, I am a size s/xs, this jacket size small more like others size xs.

The jacket itself is good quality, I believe it can keep me very warm, but size incorrect is one reason why I return it, the 2nd reason is that color is so blue, mmmmmmm, like 50th or 60th Chinese workers uniform. I don't mean it's anything bad, just this is really not my color. I also own some coats in navy blue, but they are way brighter.

And the 3rd reason is, it's really too heavy. I just tried it on for few minutes, I feel my shoulder like carried a heavy backpack for whole day."
I did not care for this item.  It ran small and appears to have no spandex/ stretch.  Will not buy again.
"nice shoes and was happy with the look but the straps were big so my foot sides forward.  Ive had to put non slip to prevent my foot from slideing forward, not sure if that will work but Ill give it a try. if It wasn't for that ive given it a 5 star. if you have wide feet then this will be perfect for you"
Like the shirt but to tight in the neck.
It started to rust already when i got. Nice bracelets but the material needs improvement
"Great shoe, but the sizing is WAY off.
I normally wear an 8.5, based on the reviews I ordered a 9.5 and they were way too small."
"I purchased an 8.5 because I own a pair of Ryka running shoes in 8.5 that are my goto comfort shoe.  I thought these would be pretty much the same fit, but wore them to work and realized as my toes started aching that the shoes were too short.  If it weren't for that, I would give the shoe 5 stars.  I will try and use a shoe stretcher on them,  a little more space and I would be happy, but don't need any added width or they would fall off."
I ordered and Xlarge and a Large.  The x-large was too big and the large was too small.  Kept the xlarge as a house dress but would not wear this outside.  The material is pretty decent thickness so the bulges are not on display.  Would make a great swim coverup as well.
"This really makes it much easier on the knees when twisting and turning with zumba on my carpet. On the other hand, I have to pull the one back onto my shoe every song or two- it works its way off no matter how I place it or which shoe I put it on.  Even with that though, I still use them every time and would totally buy them again for how much stress they saved on my knees- I just wish I didn't have to pause and readjust so often."
"Nice boots, but too small around the calf."
I was a little disappointed at the quality of this wasn't so great but it can be used for a Sunday at the beach kinda day deffenetly not something you could just wear to go shopping a little see trough for me
"Love the interior comfort of the slipper but very loose around the top.  While it is adjustable by pulling in the tie string, not accustomed to a shoe being this loose.  Aside from that love the slipper.  Use it as a driving shoe."
Was not like the pic. Straps weren't shown as criss-cross & puc shows 2 ruffles in the skirt. It had 1 large one. Fit was ok.
"I've been using this product for quite some time now daily as directed and I can't really say I have seen any difference. I know it is supposed to a performance ""booster"" and be used in conjuction with the skin care products you already use, so I wasn't looking for any realy extreme change in my skin to begin with.
Here is what I can say. This product is an oil. It should be used in small amounts. If you have very oily skin, as an esthetician, I am going to recommend you not try it at all. I tend to be a bit on the pily side and when I first tried it , a few hours after using it, my face started to feel like it needed to be washed. I was only using a drop or two and blending it in before applying my daily serum.
After that, I decided to only use it around my eyes, where I do tend to be a bit drier. I can say that it DID work well aling with my eye cream to make the skin around my eyes les dry, but other than that- nothing significant took place.
For a well-known brand in skin care, I was really hoping I could see a positive difference to report, but unfortunately, I didn't.
I say skip this ""extra"" step in your daily ski care routine. It's just another step and an extra cost."
The tong part was too uncomfortable for me.
"The elastic rolls at the bottom of the bra, otherwise okay. Wouldn't purchase another one it's a pain."
"not sure about this yet, might be returning it
it is pretty & a great design idea but really doesn't work well. have to keep your hand like the girl in the pic always up for it to look nice and any movement just looks like a pile on your wrist & hand down it slips right off. yes it is adjustable but if you make it too tight you won't have much hand movement because it is also attached to your finger lol
IT also takes someone else to put it on you, this is not a slip on you have to undo the clasp otherwise you are putting it on wrong & it will be too small."
"I'm 5'7"", 150 LBS.  I have a slight bulge around my stomach, but am otherwise quite fit.  I generally wear either a 33 or 34 inch waist, depending on the cut.  I got these in 34 and they are definitely too big which means I should have gone for the 33.  More importantly, though, I don't like the way these fit around the top.  There is too much fabric in the front which makes it a bit bulky.  It is too short in the back which means I need to be careful about plumber's crack.

The fabric itself is quite soft.  It also has a bit of stretch to it which means if it is just a bit too small, you should be fine (i.e. if you are between two sizes, go with the smaller one).  I don't understand this trend of buying jeans that are pre-ripped; I am pretty hard on my clothes and they wear out on their own fast enough, but.. whatever.

These pants are not great for my body shape, but I think for another body shape that it does fit on, I think they would be very comfortable."
"The description did not make it clear, and I could not tell from the picture that, in the charcoal color, this shoe is in suede.  Suede can be nice, and the shoe may be nice, but I was not looking for a suede shoe.  I did not try on the shoe and did not really look at it because I did not want a suede shoe, and it was not cheap enough for me to want to keep it for next season frankly."
"LOVE the design on the shirt. Unfortunately it was too short, which was weird because based on the other reviews. The reviews I read said that it was too long. I ordered an XL for my 6 ft 4 husband and thought that since it ran long it should be perfect. The shirt was about the length of one of my shirts and I am 5 ft 7. I really wish that we could have made this work. I was tempted to order the next size up but I am afraid that it would make the fit too wide."
"I wanted to love this shoe.  It ran a little small and the white sole is not flexible.  They were awkward to walk in due to the heavy, hard sole.  The gold colored straps were a great color and texture.  The straps were soft and I don't think they would rub, but they're also a little flimsy.  Had to return :("
"This was a nice looking shoe, but as someone with slightly narrow feet, it was way too wide. There was a visible gap between my foot and the top of the shoe, and I couldn't adjust it enough to work. I guess I could order a narrow size directly from the company."
"This dress is alright. I ordered the black and white one. It fits me around the waist as it should, but it is much longer than expected, it goes far past my knees. Also, the top white part fits kind of funny and is somewhat crinkled up around the top. It doesnt sit flat across my chest.. and for reference I am 5'0 ft tall, 100lbs, and I am a 32A bust. I can make it work, it will still look OK, but not exactly as I expected it to be. :( and I bought two of them!"
"Bought this for my 11 year old son to wear for Halloween.  He's a little shorter than average and average build.  It fit him well, with a little room to grow.  I'd say that if your child is on the taller or heavier side, this might not fit.  The jacket is long but narrow.  The vest has plenty of room.  Pants were just a tad long but like I said, my son is on the shorter side.  It's decent quality for the price.  I've washed it twice now and one of the seams is coming undone on the pants.  I'm sure it can be easily mended but I probably won't waste my time as it has served its purpose so it's okay."
"What I liked about these was the silver color and the fact that the leather sole had some support. Also, the rubber soles were nice and grippy. but they weren't wide enough to be as comfortable as I wanted them to be, so I returned them."
"Easy on, for sure but not as much ""cinch"" as I thought it would be. Is comfortable. Might have chosen a smaller size."
"i wasn't aware that the top of the purse had 2 stupid silver lines that stand out and totally don't match the look at all. Still gonna rock the purse, but not happy about that."
Didn't like the straps.
I love the look of the bag but was disappointed that my Macbook Air would not fit inside the padded compartment - the main reason I purchased this bag.
These sunglasses are well made and look great...just not on me.  They are a little small on me and the shape of the frame is just something I don't look good in.  Perfect for the right person.  Try them on a Sunglass Hut.
Ended up giving it away because the torso was very short for me.
"After only a couple hours of wear (most of which was spent sitting down) they start rolling down from the top.  They're adorable and were perfect with the outfit I bought them for, but I was really bummed that they wouldn't stay up.  I'd strongly suggest getting a garter belt."
"in the picture the ring looks pretty thick on the side, but in real life the ring is very sharp on the edges."
"This dress is very pretty.  I do not know how well it wears, as I purchased it mainly for the holidays.  However, I do know the dress runs a size smaller than stated.  Normally, I like things that are not form fitting (which this is), so I order a size larger.  Might be best to keep that in mind, when ordering."
Look nice but size is way off
These are platic backed buttons.  I don't believe the top of the buttons is real brass.  It is difficult to get the tack half inserted straight into the button while trying to hammer it.  I used a pair of slip joint pliers with part of the garment protecting the top of the button.
"These jeans are beautiful, not to thin, mid rise, and the 18 is more like a 14. I am a 16 in most jeans & I was uncomfortable squeezed in these. Update: After successfully returning these jeans last February my ccard was charged today additionally by Zity for these jeans returned 90 days ago. Amazon is processing the refund now."
"material of the shoe is  too stiff in the toe area, no padding in foot bed but as far as looks - looks great!!!!"
"My mom loves purple. These come in purple! They are a very soft leather and are lined so that they are warm, without it being too bulky. Mom has short finger and usually the pinkie is way too long. But these, these fit ... well, like a glove!

They should make this same design in a tech version (only the spot that has the tech material should blend with the glove, cuz I hate when you have patches on the glove that are different color!)"
"this outfit is cozy, but the jacket is very difficult to snap, due to the thickness of the flowers.  should be a zip up."
"<edit: I am leaving my original review below, but am significantly changing my rating, so want to leave an explanation here>

Check out the pictures. As reviewed below, these continue to be comfortable roughly 6 months in, but they are literally disintegrating.

The woven footbed was the first to start falling apart, followed by the stitching, and then ultimately the glue which holds the fabric to the sides.

They began falling apart about 2 months in to regular use.

Original review below.

______________________________________________

So my wife made the decision that we're going shoeless in the house. Problem: we have polished concrete floors.

So obviously we needed to get some house shoes, and STAT.

We already have some asian decor theming to our home, so it made sense to me to look for some asian style house slippers. I tried several and ultimately sent them all back.

THESE puppies, however....

The reviews I read mentioned that they form quickly to your feet. Both my wife and I generally need shoes with aggressive arch support, something lacking in most house slippers. I figured these were worth a shot, and they looked nice enough, so I pulled the trigger on a pair for both of us.

Let me tell you, they aren't kidding. Within maybe one evening of wearing them, they had already begun to conform to my feet. The footbed is packed with something akin to memory foam, but less likely to return to original shape. I've had them for about a month now, and they pretty much retain my footprint no matter how long I go between wearing them.

Very comfortable, they look good, don't get too hot, and they have non-marking soles.

My wife felt that the toe box on hers was too small, but as she has worn them more, either it has stretched out a bit, or maybe her feet finally sunk into the footbed. Either way, she's wearing them more and finding them to be comfortable .

Now if I can just get her to start wearing a Kimono around the house...."
"It's difficult buying shoes sight and size unseen.  These are glossy as the photo shows and true to color...a neutral beige.
As is the case with alot of heels, the back is quite rigid and can irritate the skin if not fit properly."
The soles are fairly slick.
Good Quality but was too big and had to return. Return process was easy and seller was easy to communicate with.
Great looking and fitting sneaker but it's fur lined and too warm for me.
"This looks SO AWESOME but it is SO impossible to wear for more than a few minutes. It is small and the placement of the holes that you're supposed to see out of makes no sense, and there is a random hole in the neck? Maybe to help it breath, but it doesn't. Possibly a little kid could wear this as a costume piece as their head would be smaller and it would have more room to breath but as an adult - I'm glad I just got it for funny photo shoots and not a Halloween costume, because I think I would pass out from lack of oxygen if I was trying to walk around in it."
I tried a pair on before washing them and after washing none of the socks were the same. They shrunk in length and width. They will get me by until I can buy some at the store where I can see what I am buying.
"I have bought this same style of bra before and it fit wonderfully. This particular batch doesn't fit the same from ones I ordered a few weeks ago. The bras do as they say with minimizing your breast size and they do not cut like many underwire bras made for fuller figured women. I will purchase again, but consider getting a bigger cup size just to be safe. No spillage, but just for comfort of fit."
"Its all right, I'm 5'10, 135 lbs and got a medium, which fits fine. But the thick side bands are not flattering or the least bit sexy, it reminds me of a mom swimsuit. I like my butt to be covered, but this is sort of too much coverage."
"These shoes are pretty and look better in the picture.  The soles aren't shaped like the foot --not like Dearfoams-- and they are not wide enough.  The soles are flimsy.  They run small and my toes hit the seam at the front, which doesn't make them terribly comfortable.  Wouldn't buy again."
The pants were WAY to short.  The shirt and hat worked but no luck with the pants.  It was for a school project and served its purpose.  Didn't have time to send it back for another pair of pants.
very comfortable but this bra (I ordered a SMALL) has so much fabric at the top that it shows above the neckline of all my shirts.
"I got one of these for my Kaylee Fry cosplay from Firefly. I've got big plans to paint swirls on it.
I chose the fabric because it will hold up better than paper, and if it rains, it's not a huge problem. I'd buy one again."
"The shoes are nice, but they weren't any wider in the toe area than the med., and were too large in the heel.  Giving up and going to a shoe store where they can help me.  I had foot surgery 1 1/2 years ago for hammer toe and bunion on one foot.  Now all shoes seem to be too tight on that foot in the toe area. Also, stitching rubs on foot."
"Not bad for limited amounts of walking, but even as someone who likes a good amount of cushion, these feel too mushy to me. The fit is good and they breath well, but even on concrete they seem just a bit over cushioned to me."
"Was unsure as to what size to order, so as I normally wear a women's large, I ordered a 2xL based on reviews.  It is a bit too big for me; I can wear it for casual/working around the yard so it is fine, but I would suggest only going one size up or even trying your normal size if you order."
"I think it should be noted that the material is jersey.  It fits well and looks nice, but I am not going to be able to wear it as much as I would like because of the material."
"The waistband starts to become loose and misformed after 20 washes or so (and I only wash on gentle cycle).
Other than that, I love the product."
"The armholes were too small and it was a bit short. I have a fairly big chest for the rest of my body, so that probably had something to do with both of those fitting issues. It wasn't long enough to really wear as a tunic (I'm 5'8). Meh. If the armholes were bigger and it was a smidge longer I'd've kept it & worn it all the time!"
These bras are comfortable but not much support. Not good for long term. This is more of a sleep bra to me because of the lack of support. You will bounce around in it.
I would have rated these 5 stars a month ago but I was wearing them and the crotch started to split. It isn't totally torn but I expect more Carhartt.
"Nice quality shirt overall  ... however, to my surprise it was a bit snug (100% cotton, so a bit smaller coming out of the dryer after the 1st wash) / other brands of XL fit me fine / I should have ordered a XXL.  Recommend prospective buyers click on and closely review the sizing link before ordering."
These did not fit although I have broad feet.  The shoe itself was attractive and appeared well made.  Disappointed that they didn't fit but not the fault of the manufacturer or Amazon.  Should have known better than to try buy without a fitting.  I never need to return stuff from Amazon but this was the exception.
glasses don't fit my head. they fall off every time I bend over.
WOULDN'T REORDER
Comfortable for a while.  Arch support not quite enough.  Comfortable on days where I do not do a lot of walking.
"Sturdy suit, but way smaller than described.  Sadly, my son (when wearing his new bathing suit) looks like he is wearing last year's suit.  Order a size up."
I have purchased about 10 of these shirts.  This past year the material has become thinner and is different than they used to be (bring back the old material). Also they do fade when laundered. It's gradual but I can tell how old my shirts are by how faded they are.
Nice well made boots. I have wore them a few times. I'm  sure they will be good next winter. After reading Other comments and reviews I thought they would be little more stylish For year round and  be very comfortable and have the foam padding like other sketchers do. They look like winter boots  which is fine but that's not what A lot of reviews said. There a little tight on my toes but I'm sure they will  stretch. I ordered a 9 1/2 and usually wear a nine or 9 1/2 boot. The heel is comfortable  Doesn't hurt my feet as some do. I  don't feel any of the foam padding they say it has at all though! Don't feel any different than any  my other boots or shoes in that regard. 3 stars because  this is my first pair of sketcher boots and I expected them to have a lot more padding and be more comfortable like my sketcher  tennis shoes are and more stylish.. I paid full price they weren't on sale so I think I just expected a little more  I think they will be very nice winter boots though I will update if anything changes
I just didn't care for the fit on me.  The product was of fine quality though.
Fits smaller than expected!
These undershirts are thin but they fit fine. I just wish I could find a plus size undershirt that was thicker and made with polyester.
"I would of loved this dress if it fit. The size large was way to small for me, even though I normally wear a small/medium. If you have a small frame, I'd definitely buy it."
"Waist fit was good , but length was way too long had to get the cut and hemmed ,not pleased"
"I want to love this shirt, it's just not as long as I was hoping. All of the previous reviews say that it is long enough to wear with leggings but it just didn't quite meet that for me. I am 5'10"", 215 and it just wasn't flattering. The shoulders fit well which is a first for me it was just the length. I even asked previous customers if it was long enough and got the one with the side buttons as most people suggest since it is the longer of the 2 optios."
Everything great except make feet black. Wondering if I could coat them with something to prevent transfer of color
Not really what I expected. But it's okay.
"Seems like a nice pair of cleats, but even after ordering a size and a half up they were too small."
Would prefer the fitted shirt instead on next order
"Order a size lager, and be prepared to have some bra showing (if you are the type who must wear a bra). (And possibly a needle an thread for any repairs- if you plan on wearing it more than once)"
"I'm 6ft 3in 190. I purchased an XL.
Shoulders fits fine the rest of the shirt is huge.

Reviewers should state their height and weight when describing fit.
At least two said the shirts run small, hmmm."
"Quality is not as good, doesn't stretch like they used to, and doesn't last as long"
"The tank top itself and shelf bra are nice looking, but the clasp is really hard/impossible to do one handed (which you have to do if you're holding the baby). You have to insert the bottom under the open circle and then pop it in. Vs other tanks where you just pull it over a hook and snap into place."
Not for tall girls with a larger chest. But great shirt overall.
Yes I ordered an 11WW and an 11W to see which shoe would work. The 11ww was too wide and it caused my feet to slide in the shoe. Shoe has been returned.
The overall fit was a little bigger than expected. I felt almost over dressed. And unfortunately returned this dress. Thankfully the return was quick and easy which is always appreciated.
"Nice sweater. Color more burgundy than bright pink, but I am keeping it!"
Husband tried it on and fit too snug. He's not a slim fit
"The fit was no where as good as the Decky Campus Jeep cap that I bought.  Too much room ""above"" my head, which shows an annoying ""flap"" that is not flattering for me.  Had I not waited so long, I should have returned this item. It's just not my style once I actually tried it on."
The length was a little long
"This is the second pair as the first pair was returned, They run a much longer than the normal size would be.  We went down a size and they are better but one foot flairs so I don't feel they fit him correctly but for saturday loafers I guess they will do.  The color is great!"
"NOT ADULT size! runs really small, thin and short. could be more for a size xLg. in little kids!"
Ok but the hat was smaller than I expected.  Didn't look good on me.
"Easy wear, easy care.  My kind of dress for work.  I run between size8-10 - I got the large but probably could have gotten medium. I'm keeping the large though because I still like it a lot.  If I wash and dry it will allow for a little shrinkage."
Very pretty but it would not go over my instep and I ordered 1/2 size larger than I normally wear
No support in top.
"My husband LOVES this brand and style of pants - although for his shape they need to fit differently.  They are too high in the waist. He has  a tummy that needs to be above the belt line.  He has other pants that are cut lower in the rise and fit better - but he doesn't like the fabric, or the color, or something....  so he wears these - in one color or another - but they all hang low in the crotch, droop in the seat, and bunch up in front  It also makes the pockets gape open showing the very light colored lining. No mater what color the pants are, they all have a ""cream"" colored lining... WHY?  Even if they fit well the lining would show when he was seated.  Is there another style of Dockers that has a lower rise?"
"Shoes are very comfortable and attractive.  The photo is darker than the actual shoe.  The suede is soft and the soles provide great cushioning when walking.  Those are a great substitute for sketches which were way too expensive. 5 stars for 1st pair

UPDATE: Ordered a second pair...blue.  Item was supposed to arrive on June 4 but after waiting all day was notified at 10:00 pm via email that item delivery will be delayed by 4 days!  It's a good thing I wasn't planning my wardrobe for a trip expecrting to use those shoes.  Again, my purchase is late after being promised I would receive my item within 2 days.  AMAZON, IF YOU CANNOT ADHERE TO YOUR TWO DAY PRIME DELIVERY YOU SHOULD LOWER THE COST OF PARTICIPATING IN PRIME. 1 star for second pair"
"It's cute and well made, but too small. It is 23"" as state. I measured my head first & found it's 23"", but the way the cap is suppose to fit on the head requires more than 23"" to fit."
"I had to order this dress twice and both times it was too big. The sizes listed are three sizes too big, I even measured myself before I ordered the first time. The Blush pink is more gray in person and not very bright, but it's still a beautiful dress and I just wish it fits me."
"Even after loosening the laces, the tongue on this shoe feels like its compressing my foot. These are no where near as comfortable as the 574s."
"Unfortunately they look cheap (you get what you pay for). The vinyl upper looks cheap and the shoe is semi comfortable due to the hard vinyl. I expected better from Polo, but likely a stab at the low end market for them."
"Not quite what I expected. Thin bags, enough for one over night's stay. Not vey big!"
Band broke off eventually
I had to have this dress altered as the waist was way too big and it was a bit wide. Next time I will definitely size down.
"These were cute, however I returned them because they were too tall for me to feel comfortable. I wear wedge sandals every summer day to work, and some of them are sky high, however these towered over them! I didn't feel stable when I tried them on in my house. And they were meant for a night out, so I could see disaster looming after a few cocktails and trying to dance. As for the color (red), it wasn't a super deep red, it was more of a red that had orange undertones than say the blues of a saturated red. If you're a pro at super duper high heels/wedges, go for it!"
"It does feel as if it would cool in hot weather which we haven't had yet. Problem for me is it has zero support. I thought foam cups meant it was a contour bra. It's not. It's got a very thin layer of something in the cup that hides absolutely nothing. It is comfortable though so I can wear it around the house, but I could never go out in it.

Worst problem for me is that it arrived smelling like a glade plug-in or bug spray. I had to air it out on the porch for three weeks before the smell dissipated. When I decided to keep it I washed it and it still has a faint odor. I would assume that's seller's fault for storing improperly but another reviewer complained about same thing.."
"Nice looking boots, I ordered them in a 8.5 just like my last pair of timberlands but they were way to small. A little narrow in the width but in length my toe was hitting the frond of the boot. I would need to get a whole size bigger"
"Starts to stretch after it has been washed, and it lost its shape and texture as well."
It little to big but I think cause it a wrong size but the jacket overall is a nice jacket
Sleeves are too tight - not properly proportioned for the length & width of the garment.
Nice teal color but very thin material.
"This shirt fits very strangely.  You can't lift your arms up when it's tucked in.  The fabric is nice, not too low cut, but the fit kills it."
A Little Low IN The Back Ankle area. So when wearing socks with these shoes expect them to take up half a size.
I was buying for a gift but kept for myself.  Thought they would have been bigger.  I do like wearing them.
Well made but too small!!
Buttons popped off when washing but it didn't fit over my chest to start with so its still wearable.  The fabric is a nice thick stretchy knit.
"Looks kind of cheesy. I thought it would look more like a pearl. It's ok... Just two white balls on the end, nothing special."
"Is it my foot or the shoes?  The right foot felt like a dream, the left like a nightmare.  The right shoe was just a tad loose and feels great, but the left shoe is tight and rubs my heal.  I am trying to stretch it hoping it will fit like the right.
I sometimes had this problem with Skechers before.
A cute casual shoe that looks good with skirts or shorts."
pushes my glass to close to my face - nice glasses well made
Cute boot but too heavy for my foot issues. I ordered 10 and 10 wide. 10 too narrow and 10 wide fit but heel was loose if they were lighter I would of kept them but with my feet issues I can't wear a heavy boot.
I was disappointed that these did not stretch as much as others of the same size. I plan to keep them and slim down into them.
It's a bit on the small size but it's comfortable and does it's job.
"I like the print of this.  It's more attractive on the model than in person.  The fit is pretty big in my opinion, but is not really off the shoulder as opposed to just a wide neckline.  It just looks sloppy off the shoulder.  I did get a lot of compliments on it however.  I wish the skirt part was a little more fitted.  The colors are really nice."
I am tall so the shirt dress was pretty darn short. Without wearing leggings it would have been inappropriate for a business family Xmas party. VERY Baggy but I ordered a larger size for length. The material feels is soft but some things were cheap (Velcro closures). The neck piece didn't align properly but it's only noticed by the owner. Worth the price I paid.
"Too big but they were warm and waterproof. I have to note though, I really prefer a tight fitting glove. I don't like that they don't have elastic to keep them around your wrist when you have to take them off every now an then."
"These shoes are beautiful, hands down, but they do run small. I wear size 7 M and Steve Madden shoes run about a size smaller or so. I have tried 7,5 they are snuggly, but size 8 are loose... so I guess I am in between 7,5 and 8 in Madden shoes. Have to return...."
Much smaller than the New Balance I already own.
"they are comfortable. perfect length for under dresses. only thing they gave me one red pair instead of the pink, that I needed."
It is super cute but the tutu is no where near that poofy when u get it! Very disappointed! That's why I wanted it.
"Good for lumberjacks, not so good in the office"
"Decent fabric but some loose threads, though the stitching itself appeared okay. I thought this would hit my natural waist but it hits above it, which was an awkward fit for me but might look good on someone younger."
"They fit my wife well, they are inexpensive and they are comfortable.  All that is great, but as some other folks have said, the thigh bones curve off to the side so you don't really see them when you look straight at someone.  So, if they could fix this design issue I'd give it five stars but not in this current design."
Cute tights but I read the description wrong and thought they were leggings when I ordered.  A little to tight for me.
"I cannot understand why this pair of jeans fits tight, because my favorite pair from NYDJ is a size 8 and still fits...but, I am sure, this pair, just like the others that I own, will last for years. I LOVE NYDJ"
I was hoping they would be a little heavier. But still a nice earring.
Gael made and nice material. Fit strange with very full thigh area.
I knew the price was very good but I worried about the quality.it feels like plastic.the only thing good is that the snaps work
"This sweatshirt is much shorter than I expected.  I'm very short in the upper body, and it barely hits my hips... meaning when I bend over to pick up my daughter or anything else, it rides up and i have to adjust it constantly.  The sleeves area also short.  The model in the picture must be petite because it looks like she has room in the sleeves as well as the torso, and it's just not the case."
Seems to be well made. I like the pattern. Runs big...I would order a size down next time
a bit sheer of material; overall it was a decent dress but never really liked the fabric
Gave away.  Seemed like it was tight around little toe area.
"I've worn NB before & size 8-1/2 fit perfectly (as do other tennis shoes in that size) but this time they were just a tad short so I wasn't comfortable wearing them for anything over a half hour. In street shoes I use 7-1/2 or 8 so thought I was safe. Otherwise, they're beautiful & the lining is comfortable. But they'll have to go to daughter:)"
Not lined but material is thick. Could have been made better
Used the luggage to travel abroad and the seams are coming apart.
"These flip flops are fine, but nothing special.  I've worn them around several times and they are holding up. Not especially comfortable, but not bad either.  They are acceptable to stomping around at the lake and walks around the house, but I would hesitate to recommend them for more than that.  If you are looking for a nice/comfortable pair to wear around town, these are likely not the ones you are looking for.  If you want an inexpensive pair to cruise around the house in, then you could do worse than this pair of Teva's"
Comfortable but doesn't wick moisture as well as other materials. It is a cotton shirt after all.
I am a size 12 and the 12 fit perfectly. Giving a 3 rating because just too many holes for me. Im a little conservative. The thighs were bulging out of holes but overall the shorts were a comfortable fit
"Pretty, but difficult to put on, and even worse to take off."
"I had high hopes for this one - it looked great in the picture and I figured it would be a good transitional garment for fall/spring. However, when it arrived I found the fabric to be thin - almost like a felt - and nowhere near as shapely as it appears in the pictures. It could be that it is a larger size than I need, but a smaller size would have meant shorter sleeves, more than likely, and I just am not thrilled with the way it looked. I plan to do some alterations to bring it in, make it resemble the pictures more, and add a lining so I have some additional protection. As it is, I can feel any weather right through it."
Beautiful dress although the bling on it was put on very uneven. Easy fix but you would think it would of been put on right the first time.
"had to reorder in a smaller size, was too big on the 1st try. was pleased with smaller fit and wears nicely"
fits very good but the zipper was not attached on one side of the head and you can not see through it
"The dress looked so nice on the reviewers who posted images but it did not work for me. The top was fitted across the bust but then gaping in spots around the arms/sleeves and collarbone. The fabric is thicker than I expected which was a plus but it also was a bit cheap feeling overall. I ordered up because I have a large chest and hips/back and it fit okay in those two areas but there was a lot of additional fabric around my stomach (which is not flat to begin with). Although I have a long torso, the dress fell below my knees and would have to be taken up (not worth the money to me or the time to do it myself because of the peplum hem)."
"Beautiful boot!  Very high end and the pair I received seemed well constructed.  However, they are very short and tight in the calf.  I usually wear a 9 in regular shoes, tried a 10.  Would need an 11.  My calves are 13.5 in circumference and I had to unzip the back zipper to get them on.  Not sure how much they. Would stretch over time.  Sizing was so off it might be difficult to find the right size."
Ended up not being particularly fond of the color or cut.  I ended up getting body glove and was much happier.  This is sitting in my closet as a backup now.
A gift that my turtle loving friend appreciated
"This shirt ran a little large.  Had to wash and dry it on high to get it to shrink to fit.  The material is not soft, and seems to wrinkle quickly.  Also, the sleeves tend to shrink faster than other parts of this pique polo."
"very tight, designed to be a layer."
Very small glasses.  Not for a grown man.
The socks are not like the ones I buy at the club house but they will be ok.
"I love my Sam Edelman Ginger sandals but now it's basically impossible to buy a new pair anywhere. In order to slow down their wear and tear I figured I'd buy another pair of sandals to wear around and give them a break. I decided on these because they have pretty much the same structure, soft sole and ankle straps. Unfortunately these are not nearly as comfortable. The leather strap attached to the toe piece runs horizontal causing it to dig into my second toe. Not ready to give up on them yet I'm going to try to cut into the strap a little."
"I was just looking for a cheap work watch that I didn't mind scratching... What I got was a very well crafted, good looking watch that could be worn just about anywhere.

Update: the date display no longer works. So, down to 3 stars.."
"It was a pretty dress.  Top was a little to big for her and would of needed adjusting, as she is not well endowed there.  Sent it back, but for the price, it was as expected, better honestly."
dress sizes don't match what you actually wear-way too small-had to do a lot of adjusting
"This dress fits well, however, if you are busty it would be best to wear a cami or invest in some safety pins... =)"
This gloves seem like they are well made and built to last BUT the touchscreen finger tips need work because they hardly work at all. You have have your fingers *just* right to get them to do anything.
ok but really big
Definitely runs small. Watch out.
"Fabric is nice. Inseam is actually long enough to cover my ankles - I take a 33"" inseam in jeans - but then I haven't washed them yet. I ordered a XL hoping for a loose fit. The bottoms are much larger than the top. Bottoms fit like a XL, top fits like a medium. Odd."
"I have 6 pairs of Easy Spirit Traveltime Slip On's that I bought 6-7 years ago.  I wear the Black with Mesh insert and the White one's the most thus now they are loooking ragged. I bought the above black shoes with a lil patent leather trim this time and also the White One's that do not have Patent leather trim.  The white one's are great!  The black one's (see above) squeak from the patent leather.  I am not sure I am going to keep these as ""you can hear me coming"".  East Spirit shoes are the most comfortable shoes in the world.  But, I hate squeaky sounding shoes.  This is caused from the added patent Leather trim. May just return these."
I'm hoping this thing shrinks a bit cause it came in way bigger than I expected.
"I love these shoes. I bought them because a friend had them at church and they are so comfy. However, my boots were scuffed when I opened them and took them out of the package. That was disappointing."
Really thin and took forever to get here.
"My husband thought he would like these but they didn't stretch much so they weren't as comfortable as he wanted them to be.  We returned them for the Levi 505 Roth-Stretch jeans, he loves those."
"I usually wear Keen Newport sandals, so I am used to a wider fit in Keens.  These slippers, like other reviewers said, have a snug foot opening and fit closer than a slipper fit.  They do not allow for a heavy sock, they fit best without socks.  I worked the slipper and flexed the soles, and the fit improved a lot.  The elastic gusset will stretch on the sides and give a much better comfort.  Once I stretched these a bit, they fit well and are becoming very comfortable.  Nice indoor/outdoor slip-on slipper shoes."
These earrings are okay.  I expected to be a little bit longer and wider than I received.  It will serve its purpose for what I need them for.
"This VANITY FAIR WOMENS SMOOTHING COMFORT ILLUMINATION BRIEF PANTY (13263) features an extra spandex panel in front to help smooth the tummy.  The spandex does NOT offer firm controlwhat control there is, is barely there, and the smoothing or slimming effect is minimal.  However, its a nice panty."
"Really nice vest, just came in a very large size"
"the plasted sleeves are very strong, they split to easy."
"A lot bigger than I expected!! If you want huge sunglasses, these are the ones. I didn't realize they would be so large. I like big sunglasses, but not this big. Wish they were a little smaller."
"I think it's obvious why these are on sale. Yes, they are Dansko  they are nice  just not as much arch support as regular ones and they run small.  Will wear them around the house today and decide later.
Don't seem to have the rocker bottom."
So adorable but too small
These are a bit flimsy and the fit is small.
Light weight for the summer. Price was also awesome.
"As expected, does a pretty good job on suede. All of the edges are helpful."
Shoes are shoes.... these are fine for work.
I should have read the reviews before purchasing these shoes.  They are tight in the toe box.  One review suggested a spray stretcher which I ordered so we'll see how that works.  They were just what I wanted but just a little snug.
"These are cute slides which I was hoping to be perfect, but they are quite wide and I am having to return them. Not sure how comfortable the correct size would be since I didn't actually wear them."
The quality is the same as other Asics I have had.  Problem is the fit is a little snug.  I would recommend a half size larger.
"This dress is very pretty and flattering on the right body type. I love the mustard yellow color and length is modest. The belt is snake-patterned although you can't really see that in the photo. I rated the dress 3 stars though, because if you are top-heavy (DD+), the yellow top portion is unlikely to fit over your bust no matter what the sizing says. This may be remedied by ordering a size up, but then the waist and hips may be disproportionate. It's too bad since it is a cute dress for work."
"it's an attractive watch and looks well made but, the face and numbers are a bit small if you have trouble reading without reading glasses.  The body of the watch is pretty thick compared to most watches.  The glass is attractive but also looks a bit fake. The watch looks exactly as shown in the picture.  However, the body is large so if you are small boned, it will cover your wrist.  The sides where the band attaches are also thick and when the band wraps around the wrist, the sides of the watch seem to be curling upward and it looks a bit awkward.  If I had been able to try this watch on in a store, I think I would have passed it up because of it's bulkyness.  I may still send it back."
"I'd love to say that I was able to keep these shoes, but I wasn't .  They just weren't wide enough for me."
"Meh.  I didn't realize how FLASHY (I mean, incredibly flashy) the Calvin Klein logo is on this shirt.  You can barely see it in the photo.  Trust me.  It's huge and shiny.  I probably won't put my daughter in it very often.  I'm not too big on words on shirts.  That's just me."
I bought this purse for a teen and she was not impressed. I think it is for more for girls under 12. Cute and seems well made just very juvenile looking. For a teen or adult it would work nice as a makeup purse.
"Im not a fan of flimsy t-shirts, and this one is. I like the heavier material. Overall its not a bad shirt, just not my favorite."
Watch for a little girl its really pretty
They fit as expected....too wide!  Had to return.  Why aren't narrow sizes offered?
Not such a great quality but for the price if was ok!
it's okay. i mean i wasn't expecting much since it was so cheap. It's a bit small. I got this for a coworker of mine.
"Very little support. Not terribly secure. Alright for looks, but certainly not the most comfortable. Ankle strap starts extremely tight and rubs back of heels raw for first wearing, but eventually broke in well enough. I constantly feel as if I'm going to walk off of these, and have actually tripped on more than one occasion because they simply aren't held against the foot well enough. The soles are extremely thin, and let one feel every tiny bump in the road. Not what I was hoping for."
Not as comfortable as I was hoping.
The product itself is not finished good.... disappointed by the quality standards of Hanks. This belt will shred out... it is already shredding. The metal buckle is cool and the 2 inch length is there... can anyone suggest a very fine finished 2 inch leather belt please ?
"This is a see trough dress totally needs to be wear with something under, unless u want to show your under wear or what's under:(!!!"
NICE CAP FOR THE MONEY. IT BULGES OUT ON BOTH SIDES WHEN YOU WEAR IT. LOOKS A LITTLE STRANGE.
"whited that the pant material was better, but it fits very good"
My daughter likes the shirt but the fabric is rough.
Its a nice shirt but I feel like it would only look good on those women who are smaller endowed. I'm a 34B and it just doesn't look right. Other than that it is a very nice shirt.
"They are a little tight. If you want a looser fit, you should order a size larger. They are a little thin, but for the price they're pretty good."
"I agree with other review about being not true to size.  Boots fit tight at the toe, especially with normal cotton socks - not even thick shocks.  So, take that into consideration because these boots have thick inside lining and a hard shell with little flexibility.  I returned, but won't ask for replacement because these boots are not wide enough either, especially with socks!  A sharp looking boot, though, so gave it just an OK."
The material is really odd. Not the satin feel I was expecting.
"Niche quality and color, but a foot or two too short.  At 5'11 215 and wide shouldered this is far to short for me.  If the scarf were a foot or two longer it would have been great. As it stands now I cannot wear it without looking foolish. I gave it to my body's son.

This would be a 5 stars purchases for a skinny/short person.  I do love the color..."
The toe area is way too small and narrow. One shoe slides off and the other stays on. I had to return them.
Very cheaply made. So is only used for play time. I guess you get what you pay for. Otherwise it arrived on time and my 3 year old great granddaughter enjoys playing in it.
"I am an athletically-built, 5' 2"", size 8-10 woman with a large chest; I ordered an XL because I figured the dress might run small. To my surprise, the top of this dress is low cut and a bit large, but the bottom is very clingy and the fabric is somewhat transparent. I will probably not wear this without a jacket over it."
"On the plus side the material is good and the quality also seems good.  The waist extension is very well hidden.  I got these pants a size larger than I have bought pants in the future because all my other ones are too tight now.  The waist seems about right and I did not need the extensions.  However they are huge in the trunk and legs. Also they have a very long rise so they might be good for high waisted men.  But to me they are not stylish or comfortable to be seen in.  That was why I marked them down.  I'm 6'0"" and 180 and got 36*34.  Before this I always got 34*34. But now those are too tight.  But I have never worn pants that fit me in the waist like these but were so big in the behind and so baggy in the legs."
Cute design and very soft. Returned only because they were way too big. Ordered the same size I always wear and should have sized down.
These shoes feel clunky and have given me a couple blisters around the edges of the insoles. I prefer Kayanos more and the Electro33s a lot more.
"The sole doesn't seem of very good quality, unlike my previous Clark's"
"My daughter loves light up sneakers. I bought these Skechers because the price was reasonable (compared to light up stride rites at the time) and they were sparkly and had lights.  Unfortunately after only a few months of wear the velcro straps have frayed, the rhinestones are falling off and the pattern all around the shoe has peeled off. The soles are also worn down.  I have not washed them in the washing machine.  Just wiped them down.  My daughter hasn't outgrown them yet but they are worn out.  I wouldn't buy them again since I prefer shoes that will last longer."
"I was careful to order one of the colors that said ""Laundry Pouch"" on the front, yet I still received on that says ""Secret Pouch"" (printed upside down). I really thought the other people who complained of this just ordered the wrong color selection, but I guess I was wrong.
The quality is ok - about what I expected for the price. I'm going to try and scrape off the lettering or magic marker over the words, I guess. At least the three packing cubes are ok. I do like that the packing cubes are pretty deep and that the entire top is mesh."
"Lovely ring, but too small for my taste.  Have passed it on to someone with very small hands."
This get the job done for me but it rides up al though out the day. I'm a size 14 about 6 feet tall and if this was not a stretchy material it would not have fit.
I love this shirt! I had so many compliments on it! It hides my tummy and arms! It can be dressed up or down. I was so happy with this too until I washed it. I didn't even dry it but the lace is falling apart...little black strings everywhere. I'm so sad because I truly loved this top!
"Just pants. Nothing extra. Maybe could be a little roomier, but they might stretch. I don't know because I haven't worn them!"
bother a bit the back
bottoms fit well top was too small. The top was the reason I bought the outfit.
"Invoice says 10 and the tag on the item says size 10 but after taking it to a jewelry store it's a size 9, I recommend buying one size up from what you wear to ensure a proper fit. Otherwise it's fantastic. Although I received this item and a free and or discounted rate in exchange for an honest review, it does not change my opinion on product."
"I bought this watch to wear to my college classes. I absolutely LOVE the look of this watch as its design is very trendy right now. The face is easy to read and all stones are still intact. Unfortunately,because it is such an inexpensive watch,the back of the face seems to be cheaply made. The paint peels off after a long wear time. The dial to adjust the time juts into my skin and leaves ugly marks. Overall,I love the watch and deal with the annoying pokey feeling because I think the design is so nice."
A little tight in the bust area but large everywhere else.  The fit seems a little off.
"I feel that created stones should look as much as the real deal as possible (not for the experts, for the casual observer at least) and for me this one just does not and I am not sure why. Opal is very nice, so I am thinking it may be saphires' fault - they are just too, I don't know, too pink? Too bright? I know that it is supposed to be a plus, but for me coupled with this particular opal, the ring just looks fake and I am not sure if I will be wearing it.

My fingures are mostly size seven and it fits me perfectly."
Love the patterns and they fit well...but do not care for the loose knit on the inside of the sock.
"Ordered an XL as am buxom size 14 to have room for shirts or sweaters.  With just a t shirt, way too small ... that was a gap of 3-4 inches across the chest area while everything else was okay.  Not happy with possibly having to go up at least sizes to fit the chest area and the rest be way too big.  Returned and will not reorder."
These pants compared to lee comfort waistband run a size smaller.  I think they no longer make the comfort waistband and that this type maybe there replacement.  I like the other style better.  I wear these a lot at work.
ass munch
"I already wear some very casual, canvas Skechers that I really like, so I wanted this pair as a daily wear for work. These are not dress shoes by the slightest stretch, but my weekday work garb is informal. I saw other reviewers who said that ""relaxed fit"" means they are big for the stated size, so order smaller than usual. This I did but these were waaay too large even so. I don't find many Skechers in local stores but I definitely recommend you try them on before buying. I sent these back unworn.

I really do not see the point of making a ""relaxed fit"" shoe."
I have older bras and they maybe stretched out but this one is a little snug.
Not a good fitting for wide feet.
This is a little tight and I have a medium head.
They are really great. It is excellent package of itmes in various design and finish. Thanks to the distributor and manufacturer.
"These were a little rough at first, but after a few washings they got a little softer. I don't know that I would buy them again."
You get what you pay for.  Made like cheap children's pj's
"I usually wear an 8.5 wide in NB sneakers, but this particular style has the arch in a strange place and the top cuts into the top of my foot. It doesn't feel like it's as wide as a typical wide width NB sneaker. I guess this is to keep it from falling off your foot, but the leather is stiff enough to do that on its own. Maybe they just need to be broken in, or I should've sized up to a 9. Going to try a style with less leather and more mesh."
Regarding size description they are somewhat larger. Need to wait for using them.
"shrank a lot, not recommended"
okay for studs.
"Love Gold Toe socks; however, was expecting a thinner material.  They are great for the cooler weather, though; and, I know I'll make good use of them.  Quality is still very good."
"Picture is VERY misleading. The diamonds can barely even be considered chips. That said, good value. You just definitely get what you pay for."
"a bit large and perhaps a bit too gaudy, but not too bad for a formal occasion."
bleeds
Very cute but would be better if you could detach the things that attach to stockings because this doesn't come with any stockings so unless you buy some separately it doesn't look right to wear.
"I bought these to use as indoor slippers. Pros: nice shape, fun color, soft faux-suede material, comfortable, and low price.  Cons:  Out of the box, I noticed gray staining on the suede around where the charms make contact with the suede. This probably would not be a problem on darker colors but the staining is noticeable on the light colored suede. The shoes are not really well made- durability will probably be an issue, but at this price I shouldn't expect too much. Overall, shoes are ok but I wouldn't recommend them."
washed and they shrank right up
"I got this dress because I was not sure if the one I ordered in navy from Macy's would arrive in time for my grandson's wedding. The navy one arrived on time so I wore it.  The lilac color is a little too muddy for my taste. The one I ordered through Amazon should probably be returned since I've never worn it.  Not quite sure how to do that. I should have returned it immediately, but my sister had a massive heart attack the night before the wedding and I've been at the hospital or with her at her home since then and haven't had time to figure out how to return it."
"The fit is great, they're super comfortable, but after only 6 months, they're cracking and peeling where they bend at the toes.  : (  Guess I'll have to find something I like as well in genuine leather. You get what you pay for."
These are cute but seemed to have stretched out over time
"Fit great, comfy on hubbys feet all day. He works construction. Only lasted 8 months before leaked. Where toe meets foot & naturally  bends it seperated. Foot stayed warm. The front toe did scrape up early on too."
"I bought these and they arrived in a timely fashion, well-packaged. They look really nice and are a really good deal, but they were I'd say a full size too small. So, I'm returning them, and choosing a different brand to try."
"It is cute and the pattern was nice, it just wasn't exactly what I was looking for."
"Too small, I wear the same size for years and I can't wear these"
"The CZ stone is really quite lovely, and the setting is just fine. The earring post, however, is incredibly poorly done. I had to bend it back to straight, and the finish looks so rough I'm not sure I want to put it in my ear. My first inclination, since the stone is so pretty, is to break off the cheap post and replace it with one from a craft store."
"This is absolutely BEAUTIFUL. the price pt for details and lace is amazingly cheap.
I used this for a photo shoot-- wow.
But here's my complaints (Coquette take note):
- if you look at the photo in the amazon ad, you will see the 'cup wire' is not situated under
  her breast. i thought maybe the model had the wrong size on. No, the problem is that there
 is too much width bwtn the insides of the 2 cup wires. if you brought the wires closer to the
  front hook tab, it would fit better. Most women don't have a wide space bwtn their breasts.
- also, the patent leather strip running horizontal across the breast is too tight and presses
  against the breast. who wants an indentation across their boob!

I ended up wearing a bra under it, so i had better boob shape. Otherwise, i think it's beautiful.
i bought a large. i'm 145 lbs, 36C, 5'5"". the lace cup fit my breast, just needs some tweaking, i've
mentioned. Otherwise i would've given it 5 stars"
"Good idea but not great quality. Bought for Halloween. Tried on once before Halloween & the foam chest plate ripped. There are ties on each side to keep the shell on, my son tried to remove the shell and one tie came off completely. I had to duck-tape it back on. This is for kids, so it needs to be sturdy enough for kids. The shell is vey light and it's a nice simple outfit for a kid who won't keep an outfit on.  He still loves it and having four masks so everyone can be a Ninja Turtle."
"Like any halloween costume... it is made a little on the cheap side. My daughter went to 3 different halloween events. After the first one, the tights had started to rip. After the second one, the tie started to come loose. After Halloween night... well, it was pretty much trash. However, to wear it 3 times is great. We all know our kids get new costumes every year anyways. I would purchase from this company again."
"Kind of small, got a blister from them, normally i wear a 6 for these you need to order a little bigger. A summer shoe, not for cold weather as they are really thin and light, but the colors look as pictured and shipping was good :)"
just not a good fit for me...do love the color....will keep them for run about shoes...quick slip on to go to store or mailbox...
Absolutely beautiful but the floral decorations peel right off.  Not well made.
IT OK I LOVE THE COLOR!!!!!!!!!!!!
"I had some really high hopes for this bag - after skimming through multiple bag options, I noticed that the Scarleton brand kept catching my eye. Though there were mixed reviews for this particular bag, overall, it seemed to be a decent purchase. The bag arrived quickly and came well wrapped in plastic and a Styrofoam-like paper - it looked great. However, upon opening it, a very noticeable fishy smell was present. I'd seen this same issue in other reviews, but noted that it generally faded with time. After using Febreze on the inside and letting it air out for multiple days, the fishy smell is mostly gone, but is still there. I think it'll fade with time and use. Apart from the smell, it seems like an overall, just okay bag. $29.99 seems a bit much, as the ""leather"" and interior seems pretty cheap. I've had other cheap vegan leather bags before, but they were much more believable. The metal accents are nice and a stylish rose gold color - it looks very good with the coffee color that I chose. On the back of the outside, there is a single zippered pocket, which holds my phone nicely. Inside, there are two sewn pockets - one that would fit the smaller, flip-style phones and a second to put small items in, like chapstick. Aside from one inner-wall zippered pocket, there are no other pockets. A few reviews here mentioned a large, divider-style interior pocket, but this bag does not have that - which was very disappointing. Overall, I'll continue carrying this. I wanted to find a bag good for the winter months that I didn't have to use a strap with (as they don't fit well over bulky coats), and this bag fits the bill. It's stylish and a great size, but does lack in a few options."
"After wearing a size bigger than my regular size for most of my pregnancy, it was such a relief to get maternity scrubs!  The belly part stays up well and at first these fit great.  After washing them a few times they are short on me (I am 5'7"", now 185 pounds 7 months pregnant and I got large pants).  The belly still fits okay and the pants are tolerable but since they're short and I can't reach to shave my legs it's a problem when I sit down.  Also, after wearing them for about a month the crotch seam ripped when I sat down one day.  They are much more comfortable than my regular scrubs, I just wish they hadn't shrunk and hadn't ripped.  I fixed them and are still wearing them."
"The top was to small. I am a busty girl so i ordered two sizes up. Even though the bottoms fit the top did not. i had o buy another top to go along with this so i did not feel uncomfortable walking around with a to small one on. 5'6"" 140lbs. 36,26,38"
did not work...but it is very pretty
"very cute hat, the size is accurate..the baby seems to like it. The fur lining is super soft but is shedding, so be careful or aware of this if your child is a chewer.
have a happy new year"
The cup size is a little small and there isn't enough coverage for a larger cup size. I feel like if I bend over everything will come out of the top. Otherwise it has great shape and support. So go up a cup size!
"Made big, pants are long. Jacket isn't made as big as the pants, it fits better than pants. Pants are made of thick material."
My wrist is small so it is too loose on me.
They r very cute shoes but the do run big!! Other than that I like them. Just order a size smaller
"In the photo the hour and minute hands are readable.  In real life, they are minuscule, and disappear completely, lost in the glare of the shiny black dial and shiny cover glass!  UN-readable!"
"My kid really wanted this for her Halloween party. The quality is great but it was a little too awkward to walk around in, as it made it hard to see. But she really likes them and that's all that matters"
"Not as I expected, but ok."
"The fit's not bad, though the sleeves needed some work...

The blue of the print, though, is lighter than in the product photo which doesn't contrast as much with the grey of the shirt... Could've gone with a darker blue...

The print itself is also of barely acceptable quality..."
Looks gorgeous but I really thought I was getting two an got one.
"Had to return 2 pairs. I wear a 10 womens, so I tried the 10. It was too wide at the heel, but the length was OK. I tried the 9's and the width was OK, but the length was too short. If they made 1/2 sizes, I might be able to wear them. I give up."
"it is o.k, I guess, but one shoe seems little too small and was pinching me, so I had to return it"
"somewhat smaller but ok.,beautiful"
"These shoes are NOT for people with wide feet period, they are WAY too narrow. I used the Amazon Questions and Answers thing to ask and got mixed results. So then I went to the customer reviews and filtered with the word ""wide"" and to my surprise people were claiming that these would indeed suffice for people with wider feet. However, that was simply not the case. Not even close. I wear a size 10.5 and the length was right, but there's no way my big foot could fit in these. So now I have to return them.

Sucks because these are rather nice shoes for people with normal feet."
"I required a heel pad or small insole in order for these shoes to not ride uncomfortably under my ankle bone.

That said, they're otherwise comfortable. I've had several 12-hour shifts in them, with the insoles in, and feel good. I have has lots of compliments on them, and I love the shiny snake/croc look."
UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF LABOR OSHA -  OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH STANDARDS OCCUPATIONAL  DOES NOT ACCEPTABLE THESE FOR STEEL TOE REQUIREMENTS
"I have worn ASICS running shoes for several years, always order size 10D without any issues.  These were noticeably smaller than my 3 other pairs (which are GT-2600) and had to be returned."
Matches a necklace I was trying to find earrings for.
"This mule was okay after I used leather lube on them, BUT before they had scratches on them and it wasn't a very good presentation."
"Gives the impression of the big name boot without the cost.  However...it doesn't seem to have the give/bend in the foot part and the sole is very slippery.  Whatever material it is made of doesn't have the grip, so don't expect to use them for slippery surfaces.  They are cute and were cheap so I will keep them for more of a shoe or slipper than a boot."
I'm disappointed with the fit of this shoe. I need to return themthe toe box is tight and squeezes my toes. I can't wear them without pain!
"I bought mine on the Kickstarter program.

I love how these work with the shoes. It makes them fit perfectly every time without tieing and untieing. However, I got mine about last April and I walk very little due to medical conditions. I might get 4-6k a day in and most of that is around the house so not wearing the shoes. Believe me, they do NOT get a workout from me! About a month maybe 2 ago. (About 10-11 months after getting them) the show laces started to snap off. I am also not the only person having this problem. I went to the Kickstarter page to complain about it and saw another person saying the same thing. I am really sad about this because these are some of the better elastic shoe laces. Just know your laces won't last long. I really hope they work on the quality of the product"
"Smaller than expected ,"
"VERY NARROW AND TIGHT in the toe box.
Very painful on top of the toenails, the fabric on top is so tight, it's not good for normal toes, it sewed for paper thin bony foot. That's for LEATHER shoes.
The suede ones are softer, a lot more comfortable, even though still narrow but they stretch pretty quick.
Long shoe for no reason. The back is falling out of the shoe."
"I've had these boots for just over a year, and I wear them all the time. I got these in a 41, which would normally be fine in this brand, but they fit large, so be warned, that being said it's nothing an extra pair of socks won't fix. I've had to repair them a few times since the sole on both of them keeps coming apart from the leather, this despite the fact that I try to keep them dry and polished. Overall, not a bad boot, I would likely get them again."
"I was hoping it wasn't sheer, you have to wear black bra with it.. I'm totally satisfied."
Much to long for my husband
This shirt is on the larger side. It's okay.
"These shoes had to be severely padded for me to even attempt to walk in them for an hour. I am not an avid heel wearer but when I do I can usually bare night in them without all the extra cushions, not in these. toe area is so tight, and the ball off your foot has no protection from the impact of the ground. Not made with any thought. Beautiful shoe and for that reason I will walk through the pain."
I was disappointed when I received this top. It was all wrinkled and had a white stripe down the front for about 5 inches. It took a lot of ironing to get the wrinkles out. I kept it because I will use it around the house.
"The color is not as picture not a cobalt blue or deep blue
But the bag is reversible and functional!  I like that and ordered another color that I Love!  Great value 2 bags one price!"
I bought this for a cosplay and it worked perfectly but I would never wear this normally. It's essentially a tube of nylon that hugs every roll/curve/dimple on your body. It IS very bright. The neon color is true to the picture advertised.
Starts hurting on both sides of the foot near the toe after couple of hours. I am not a wide-toed person by any standards so the pain is due to the poor quality of the material. I never wear these shoes on days that I may have to walk beyond a couple of hundred steps.
"I'm 5'3"" tall, 165#. I am typically size 12-14 in petite jeans & US medium or large in shirts. I'm short waisted and prefer a medium shirt in the shoulders & length but the bust is usually too tight. I'm a 36 FF in UK bra size and US size 36G.

I kept these for the day that I loose weight. I ordered them in large, the price was great for 3 shirts. They were just too clingy on me at the moment. The fabric is soft and they are well made."
"Very simple but extremely cute Sad part, after 2 weeks the rose gold color was gone making the ring look cheap ugly.  I know it's only plated, but I wish its color would have lasted."
The velcro is only on a small tab. These lasted MAYBE 3 weeks before the velcro started giving up with every step. My poor daughter became so frustrated having to bend down and REDO the velcro a bazillion times a day. I ended up tossing them. Bummer cause they are absolutely adorable.
"I was so excited for this hat to come in! Pros: fits well, doesn't feel cheap, good price. Cons: I was looking for a true olive green hat and this color is more like a greyish green. When I held it up next to one of my shirts, it looked grey. Also it is absolutely a trucker hat. I didn't study it well in the pictures. But overall I'll probably still keep it and keep looking for what I really had in mind!"
A bit small in the side wall. Ya weird right but really. The hole that your foot goes in has shallow sides. Feels like my foot is falling out of the shoe. Sent back.
"These are baggy in the legs. Look oversized on my 4 year old. I don't like them and don't think the straight legged description of them fits. My son is thick boned, so it's not because he's too skinny for them. They are just too wide in the leg."
"Love how soft and smooth things feel the first few seconds of wearing it. However, unclip the sling and replace and you encounter a weird bunching up with the cups...must be the fact that it's slightly molded and lined. I am a 38/40 G/H. So, it's hard to speak of how much support I'm supposed to realistically expect without wires. I'm used to underwire, but know better for mommyhood.

I just got it today and I'm not even sure I'm keeping it. The clasps function really smoothly one-handed, but I think it runs a tad small. Also, this sling, while I like that the inner part actually supports the upper breast tissue for a huge bust like mine, I don't like that in replacing the flap it requires a ton of adjusting to avoid quad-boob. I also find that the band could have more fabric. It fits perfectly standing, but sit or flip the sling around and it seems to roll up under me. It doesn't have as much side-boob coverage as I like either.

That being said, the fabric is luxurious on sensitive breast tissue and it takes some stress of my aching back right now. I think I'll keep it. Probably a great fit for a more petite frame, even if you do have huge cup-sizes. I used to do bra fittings and it pains me to wear one that isn't ""perfect,"" but I do think there are some unreasonable expectations with boobs that fill and empty and change sizes all day...

Over all, a great bargain and I will probably keep it after all. Most of the bras in my size range of this quality are upwards of 70 bucks a pop!"
"They look just like the picture, but are almost child-sized. I don't have a very large face, but they felt small on me. I bought them for a costume, and figured I'd get some more use out of them this summer. They worked fine for the costume, but I won't be wearing them again."
"I loved the pattern, but the cut is very unforgiving if you don't have a flat stomach.  It was beautiful out of the box and extremely unflattering once I tried it on.  It's clingy on my lower abdomen and the pattern/cut draws all the attention there."
"Nice cozy fit, but a bit bulky and has a very shiny brand tag on the back. I am not into flashing brand names around, otherwise I would have probably kept these."
The cut out part looks a little cheap or cheesy to me in person. It's much cuter in the picture than in hand.
"This ring is very pretty. Unfortunately, it was too large. I used the ring sizes and measurements on this site, but it turns out they were wrong. Those need to be reviewed to avoid such incidents in the future. The sellers of this ring are all the way in China, shipping costs were too high, so returning it was not an option. I would recommend this ring, but would urge anyone trying to buy it to know their actual ring size before you order it."
"The glasses were structurally fine but the ""yellow"" was disappointing; rather light com p a red to picture"
A bit small for my needs. Bag seems well made. the back compartment is made for a tablet or small (real small) laptop. My chromebook didn't fit.
"Weird fit, they faded pretty bad. Kind of warn. The build quality is good though. Couldn't use with my uniform because they faded so bad. I would go ripstop by Galls every time now. Way better quality, cool, feel good , and don't fade. Should have done my research."
They're nice boots I just prefer a wider foot bed
"Unfortunately, the V-neck opening was too large for my husbands liking. It showed through his dress shirt. So can only wear with dark shirts."
"The only  2 complaints I had was that I ripped the crotch on these before I felt I got my moneys worth. The leg pockets were a little big. If I placed anything in them that had a little weight to them, it caused the pants to swing around.  I did like the knee pad pockets with these pants."
My calves are not huge my any means but I could not get these zipped up around them for the life of me. I got my husband to help hoping they just needed a bit of stretching but after he got them zipped up it was still just to tight..:( And then trying to get them pulled off of my leg was an epic ordeal all by itself. I thought we were going to have to cut them off at one point. So if you have toothpick legs its a beautiful boot but if you have anything over that...move on ladies. Sad I know.
"The tags on this underwear are in an unusual place on the hip closer to the front and on the outside of the underwear. If you get dressed in the dark like I often do, it can sometimes take you a couple of tries to put them on right-side out and with the right part facing forward. Why can't they put the label on the inside/back like normal underwear? I suppose it is a trivial complaint, but it is a bit annoying.

Other than that they fit well, seem to be made of durable material, and are comfortable."
"These pants are not bad considering I never heard of this brand. I ordered 30 waist and it seems a bit large (feels like a 31) compared to my Levis but it's not a big deal.  My only complaint is the denim material is a bit thinner than normal. I wear these for work and carry a radio clipped on my back pocket. My radio falls off when I'm working so had to clip it around my work belt.
These are good alternative if you are looking for (white) work pants but you loose the cargo pocket that Dickies offer with their work pants.

Edit 6-21-17
Above is my original post. I ordered size 30 waist which seemed like a 31and now after a few months the waist is now 33...lol"
Runs narrow but heel feels great.
Bottoms were perfect..but the top was small or a lot of the breast is exposed. It's very sexy
"Nice looking. But here's the problem: I got these thinking I could walk to/from work and grocery store and other things in my neighborhood. Between 2-3 miles/ day. Unfortunately, they are not good for walking in the city because there's not enough cushion for the soles of your feet if you walk in sidewalks for any distance at all. Also, when they are new, they are stiff which surprised me because they looked so soft online. Better soles and softer leather would make me want one in every color!"
"The strap that secures the wallet closure is not is a good place because it easily slips off and thus, holds nothing in place. The overall wallet is great. A little bulky, but a safe wallet."
Stitching and the stretchy material was okay and it fit pretty nicely. I believe working out definitely helps for this dress to look nicer on a thicker or more shapely build.
Didn't look as much like a cat as I hoped.
If you need a white shoes don't buy this it's beige but it looks nice if it was actually white i would give it 5 stars
runs small and there's no wearing a bra with this dress since the back is all open embroidery. No padding sewn in either. Pretty fabric tho.
"It's a very long strand that you wrap around if you want to achieve the look of multiple strands. I thought from the picture that it was actually three strands; not so. The pearls are of consistent size and it's got some weight to it, but not like the picture."
The pads keep slipping up but overall this item is fine.
"I love NAOTs.  They usually fit like a glove and I can wear them for hours but these are narrower and maybe the quality of the leather is different, but they are not the normal NAOT."
Fits small and fits higher on waist
"Runs, a bit small But I do love the way it fit on me.  the material is very nice."
The footbed was great in comfort and fit but the straps were to loose and stretchy that made it worse Some wide leather would have been better in my opinion
"It's a nice shirt, it's much bigger than expected , the photo of the shirt looks more form fitting, it fits like a baggy sweatshirt."
"Pros
1) Comfortable and light shoe

Cons
1) The New Balance ML501 running shoe cushion tends to give in more and the shoe is lighter than the New Balance ML565 Classics Running Shoe Light Grey.  Supinating or Pronating individuals will find this shoe not very supportive.  If your feet are well balanced then this shoe should be adequate otherwise try the ML565."
I still haven't been able to walk in these. They are extremely slippery on any surface. I'm not sure how to fix that.
Generally a good buy
"LEAK!!  great looking boots- they keep my feet toasty warm, but in the snow the left boot leaks.  I had the boots a month or so before the snow came and I just love them.  When we received 6 inches of snow I wore these boots to shovel and the left boot leaked !!!  - I can't tell where the leak is, but my foot got very wet and very cold.  I can't believe I spent this much on leaky boots.  It's a shame because I really like the look and they are warm- just not to be worn in the snow or rain.  - wish I could return them."
"As far as the sizing goes, whenever I read mixed reviews of how it fits I always lean towards ordering my true size. This slipper is one that believe the people who say it runs large! I wear an 8 and 95% of my shoes I own are in the size of 8. The slippers I received in my size were too large. I think I could have ordered a full size down and been fine.  They are slippers and will stretch over time.  Also, as far as width goes, I am one that is borderline medium/wide and these felt exceptionally wide. These slippers do have a patch of velcro that you can tighten, a bit. The patch is maybe 2 inches at the most and will adjust the fit across the top of your foot. It would not matter if you put it all the way to the end on the patch, the part of the slipper that is wide will still be wide. And again, the slipper will stretch over time. Had to return reluctantly."
"They are OK, but they are baggy in the thighs and too long. I would not purchase again. They do NOT fit like the model in the photo. Thighs are baggy. Soft and comfortable though."
My husband bought these. When he tried them on I thought they were for little kids and that he accidentally ordered this in the kids section. May work better for people with smaller faces. He returned.
"These gloves will not fit you well if you have reasonably long thumbs.  The fingers fit okay otherwise, but the thumb was too short for me which made the overall fit awkward.  The fabric was okay, but I didn't care for the quality of the sewing.  The fingers are strangely pointed at the ends.  Probably fine if you're not picky and have short thumbs.  :-)"
"I loved this, though I didn't realize it would be so big. The crystals are really big, so it's very bling. It's very pretty, and the rose color is gorgeous, but the face broke within 2 weeks of getting it for Christmas. I'm going to try to return it and find something a little less gaudy. The fake diamonds make the whole watch look a little cheap, though, even though it isn't."
"Bought it for the hubby, and he said it was too tight in the junk. He ended up wearing shorts on top of the pants."
a little tight. could be wider - not longer
"Fit as expected. The color is true, but the quality of the material is very poor. Arrived all crumpled and I had to iron it before wearing."
I wasn't crazy about this as it wasn't very fitted or flattering.
"Not a bad bag, but just be aware it doesn't mean the 12x12x6 standard the NFL and a lot of college teams are implementing."
Appear more cheaply made in person than in the pic but still cute.
It is hard to break in the shoes. It still hurts when I use it.
"They are beautiful! Sure wish I could wear them! The top was snug for its size but the pants were ridiculously small. I ordered 3xl and my wife wears a Womens medium and they fit her. So size is WAY, WAY OFF."
"Cheap looking around the edges, but will do for a one-off event I have. Will look fine in photos."
"Only $5 for a Macho Man shirt. I love it, "" Oh Yeah!"""
"I bought this shirt hoping to get something similar to the Down East Wonder Tee but for a smaller price. The quality is not as good as the wonder tee, but I do like how the cap sleeves are a little longer and the neckline a little higher. It is not as stretchy or as long as the down east wonder tee so you may see some bulkiness if it is used as an undershirt. I am satisfied with it, but can definitely tell a difference in the quality vs. the wonder tee."
"This wallet is pretty, but is kind of cheaply made. Thought I would get it in pink too, but changed my mind."
This housecoat feels heavy on the neck and shoulders. Not comfortable. Colors are nice.
"Works well when its like 30 degree Fahrenheit.
On super cold days, this doesnt do much. The cold air goes right through the mouth vent and your face still gets cold."
"Cute, very inexpensive in price and *cheap* in quality earrings.  I knew exactly what I was getting  (as in, ""You get what you pay for"") when I ordered these, and have no complaints in that regard.  However, I must say that it's the absolute worst sort of false advertising for these to be sold under a marked down from $99(!) discount.  These earrings, in terms of quality, are more along the lines of the sort that you'd allow a child to borrow for Halloween; costume pieces that you'd shrug your shoulders over if they were lost or damaged.

These are currently ""discounted"" at just under seven dollars.  In truth, this is more like what they'd actually retail for, with a proper sale price being anything under three dollars.  I'm seriously considering giving them a matte finish so they don't look quite so exactly like something that you use to be able to get from a box of Cracker Jaxx.

These earrings are adorable for what they are:  Very, very cheap costume jewelry."
eh looked a little flimsy.
"Boots are really nice and seem to be comfy, but they are going back. Sadly. Calf is too wide. I am not sure what people meant when they said ""I have really skinny legs and these fit perfectly"", but those are one of the widest boots I have ever tried on so far. Yes, I DO have skinny legs, my calf does not even hit the 12 inches and I look ridiculous with these. Thus, if you are on the petite side as I am, those boots won't probably work for you. (Boot Calf is about 15 inches)."
"This is a very durable mask, and good for a child's costume, but only that. As a 25 year old female, cheap costumes are only okay when they don't look ridiculously cheap. The mask was so durable that it felt like a piece of cardboard cut-out that was placed on my face. I ended up using a cut up sock in order to enhance my costume."
There's a scratch on the inside of the right boot that won't wash out.
Gave to my younger son because it didn't fit the son I bought it for.
"Was gift, but was told that they fit well."
"i love the dress sooo great for summer, but there were alot of snags that couldn't be fixed on the dress when it arrived. The snags just messed up the whole look of the dress."
"Ok, they are warm and soft. A little small and I am not a big fan of the nibbled soles. Prefer them to have more of a non skid canvas bottom I think."
"This dress is very cute. However it is a tad short, and it fits me very snug in the chest. I have a 38in waist and wear a 40D bra, so i am at the top of their size chart and ordered the4X.
I have 6 dresses from Lindy, all of which fit me differently. This one is by far  the tightest.
The dress does not have a lining to it, and the material is very lightweight, perfect for summer time.
It is a unique design, and i like having it, but If i had it to do over again I probably would go for a different style altogether.
Not to take anything away from this dress,  just prob not the best look on my body type.
I have to say it is very cute, and i like having it in my closet, but i don't for see getting much use out of it :("
"These books are pretty.  The color says whiskey but i'd say they are the same color as FRYE's cognac. What I was disappointed to see is the sole is NOT as shown in the photo.  The sole is black. If you wanted a tan more natural color sole you'll be as disappointed as I was when I opened the box.  For now, still thinking if i'll keep them or return them."
Ordered and got a size 10. Had to go through the extra time and $ to ship  back to get exchanged a size 6. Which also meant I did not have for the holidays..
"While these shirts are comfortable, they're very tight. I normally wear a small blouse, but these leave no wiggle room! If you have a great figure then you'll love these, but don't buy them if you have anything to hide!"
Ordered for my 16 year old daughter. Top is cute. Bottoms are tiny. Will keep & wear the top with black bottoms. Good price even for the top.
It did well for the wedding I wore this to but the back strap was a little large for me. I added inserts into the shoes to keep my feet from sliding ( I was in the tropics at the time). I never felt secure even though I had the strap pulled to the farthest hole.
"The good news is that these are some really cute shoes. The bad news is that I didn't take some of the reviews seriously-they are not true to size. I always wear a size 7, but these were more like a 6. They are also very narrow and tight which may not change even going a size up in length. Bummer. I think they are overpriced and overrated."
"The fit is exactly as shown in the Amazon.com size chart  I measured my daughter's bust, waist, and hips, and chose size ""large"" based on the size chart link next to the size drop-down on Amazon's site.  My daughter is 5'10"" tall, and measures 35-32-39.  Honestly, I was astounded when I measured her... she is so skinny... not an ounce of fat on her.. and I never imagined that she has a 32"" waist.  I would have guessed somewhere between 24-28"" for her waist.  I guess she is proportional to her height.  The ""large"" size of this jacket fits her perfectly.  The length is good too.

The quality is good.

The reason for only 3 stars is that I also purchased this product for myself:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Men-s-Single-Breasted-Black-Full-Length-All-Year-Round-Raincoat-46L/dp/B001GS6ATK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Men's Single Breasted Black Full Length All Year Round Raincoat 46L</a>.  The men's long raincoat costs HALF as much, and is better quality than the women's long raincoat.

Why do women's clothes cost DOUBLE???  I purchased the lowest-priced long raincoat that I could find for both myself and my daughter.  The criteria for both was:  Not too flashy (my daughter and I both prefer simple clothing that doesn't attract too much attention); Long enough to keep our clothes dry in the rain; and decent quality.

There is absolutely no reason for this women's rain coat to cost twice the price of the men's coat that I purchased for myself.  When I walk into a department store, the women's clothing section is always much larger than the men's clothing section.  It seems obvious that women shop for clothes more often than men do, so it makes sense for a department store to devote more space for women's clothing.  But... is it fair to charge higher prices for women's clothing???"
"That these ran so large. They're super cute but I couldn't find in my size. I estimate they are about 2 sizes larger than stated. Understand that mens sizes run bigger, but these were sold as a woman's product."
"Cute, but a little too wide for my son's feet.  The velcro top doesn't allow you to tighten very well."
"Wasn't as soft as I was expecting, but it fit the person I bought it for as expected."
"These are an odd fitting shoe.  The length seems fine  or as expected but there is a strange thick padding in the forward ball of the foot area that makes a strange feeling fit.  I always have to add an arch support to Bella Vita shoes, as the lasts are very flat and have no curve to them.  But maybe after a bit of wear the pad will deflate a bit and be more comfortable."
Hoping to wear with extra thick socks when my feet swell with my multiple feet issues.
"I like this, it lasted two years, but since the zipper, wheel and handle broke, i think it could be cheaper"
Liked the color & price
"One compartment, the largest, has no
zipper, consequently things can drop
if you're not careful.  It stands to reason
that a product that keeps jewelry should
be made in a manner that its contents would not
drop.  If you are not super careful,
I bet you will lose something!"
"The scarf is very pretty and sparkles brightly. However, there were numerous stains on the material and there was fabric beyond the stitched hem that was not cut off.  I had already intended on cutting the scarf down to make a head band out of it so I was able to use it. Otherwise I would have returned it to the seller."
"We loved the backpack but now it's dec and we r getting a new one. Only lastEd 4 months of school. Grr
Zipper issue and the mesh from water bottle holder busted throggh"
Cute but runs a little big
"The length of the shoe is OK but it is wide-which make my wide feet look even bigger. These shoes are not much on comfort, ""not made for walking-only to put on and look cute"". I will keep these so that I can have something cute to where this summer-I had surgery on my foot and I am finding it difficult to find comfort and style in one shoe"
"Expected to get the dark indigo blue jeans but instead got the slightly faded ones. Made the same order about 2 yrs. ago and got the nonfaded jeans like I was supposed to. Why it was different this time, I don't know."
"These shoes are uncomfortable and run narrow/small. The seam on top rubs on the feet and caused a blister. I tried to exchange for a larger size but the price is much higher then I originally paid.
Very disappointed.."
Ok so the jeans are really nice love them! Came super quick! BUT.... Sorry but if you get your size and you have curves.. And a big butt... They aren't for you.. Fits every where perfect but my butt area..stretchy fabric but tight in that area maybe they'll stretch out. I'll do another update after a couple wears.
"I don't know if it is just my head, but it cannot fit over my hair even if it is in a wig cap. The hair is too static-y and doesn't comb very well. I wouldn't recommend for any cosplay because you can tell it is not the best quality."
The shirts are what they are. Theyre inexpensive polos that show up large and shrink a little too much once you wash them losing a good bit of color and tearing the fabric up slightly. Still usable for a few months at least.
Short and tight..but good material
"These shoes are not ""white""...more of a winter white or off white so I was very disappointed because I really wanted a white shoe.  I'm happy I did not pay $70 for these shoes because I would have definitely returned them so fortunately I caught them on a special offer.  I was also very surprised that the sole of the shoe needs more cushion so they are not very comfy for wearing all day.  I normally wear a size 9 but I ordered a size up based on some of the comments but they are a little to big but that's why I got them for a lower price...guess they are trying to unload the bigger sizes.  If you want white shoes don't order the patent leather!"
Did not receive two sets of epaulets only one and did not receive the free mail in coupons for the elbow pads
small shoulder and not for man so it return and should size large and norrow
"Too thin to wear without layers. Soft fabric, perfect for nightgown."
"it has no support on sole. i love the shoe,,,but i can not wear due to it feeling like i am on the ground without a sole"
"This is attractive, yes, but not on me. I am a size XL (which I ordered), but this fits my size S daughter perfectly, so she's the one wearing it! Also, the material is rather thin. But the style is very attractive. Too bad I won't be wearing one until I can lose enough weight to fit into an available size, which will still have to be the XL even if I am really a size medium!"
"Bought this one and an army green strap from metastraps. Both seem well made but the proportions of the metastrap, I like better. With this one, I have to wear it short side down to get it comfortable. Sides of the strap are fraying after a month."
"The fabric is thick and soft, and the maroon color is gorgeous, but the stitching on the side is not reinforced enough, and it ripped when I first put the skirt on. It has a zipper, so it was not because the skirt was 'too tight'; though it was very form fitting, so if I buy again I would order another size larger than I normally wear. Also, if the side seams had a double stitch, or at least a second pass of a single stitch the seam may have not ripped. I am returning the item, but not cancelling out another future order.

Overall:
pro - fabric and color
con - side seam ripped, runs slightly small"
"Runs small. But very sparkly. Ordered a 7, but it fits my pinky."
"These are first pair of this brand that I've ever returned. We have had five pairs of See Kai Run shoes and usually find they run large so I ordered the expected size. I couldn't believe how tight these were. They WERE really cute, though. If they'd had a little more room I'd definitely kept them."
The one size is tiny tiny tiny. Very cute looking but doesn't fit most humans.
Order down a size. It is very stretchy
The material is a little flimsy.  They fit okay.  I will wear them but probably not order again.  They would be good for a big top to cover up the top of the pant but other than that they are okay.
"I would have liked them better,  if I had gotten them the first time I ordered them. But thanks to the subpar USPS, I had to order these twice to get them. I hold any company that uses USPS partially responsible because they had the poor judgment to use USPS. Other than that,  these are cute and good quality. Still a bit small but it seems this brand runs small."
This product definitely smooths your figure out but it does not hold anything in; Basically it feels like a tight mini dress (shapewear) rather than a high compression gament. Don't purchase if you are looking for something to pull unwanted fat in; if you just want to smooth out your figure then this is the right product for you!
I have other Dansko's and they are great. These are very tight around the top of my foot even after trying to stretch them out and I'm leaving this review years later. Hopefully my next pair won't have this issue.
"a little small in waist, but very big and long everywhere else.  I will be returning."
"They fit fine and my daughter likes them, but I was expecting a little more variety in the package. There were only 3 different patterns included instead of the several patterns pictured."
"For the money, this watch is okay.  The copper colored plastic looks awful, very cheesy.  The band is also cheap looking and of poor quality.  The watch itself works, and has several useful functions.  The face is busier than necessary, taking away some of the simple clarity of the analog display.  I would gladly pay a few more bucks for some more quality.  Casio should be a step, or two up from Timex, Armitron, etc."
This product was a lot shorter than I had expected to be. And keep in mind it is Japanese sizes. The sleeves are pretty snug.
"I wore one time a half a day. The point is bending up and the heel is showing wear already. The plastic of the heel is peeing off  I hate it, wanted more colors, but forget it."
Sizes run super small. Cute dress. Cheap fabric.
Way too tight.  Cute dress but because it is so snug I feel like a sausage.  Pretty colors.
"The top is actually very well made and good looking. the material is soft and the design is great. I am only giving it 3 start because of the size. It is awy toooo small. I could barely get it past my arms (head did not go in).  I usually wear US size 12/14, so probably would need to order 3-4 sizes up. Will give it to my younger and slimmer sister."
These seem nicely constructed. I wear a 9&1/2 size shoe and the opening that sits at your ankle is very tight (and no I don't have kankles so I have no idea why it is tight). Otherwise I like them. Just don't like the ring I have around my ankle after wearing them.
the long piece goes past the nuckle
"This shirt runs extremely small. Based on others' reviews, I ordered 2 sizes up, and it was still too small for me.

Additionally, the item was a shipped wrapped around cardboard. The cardboard cut into the shirt and the shirt looked pulled.

The material itself was stretchy and - had it fit and not been damaged - appears as if it would have been flattering. However, I don't think it would have worked with leggings - it's not really long enough to wear modestly (I'm 5'7"")."
"Update...i did end up returning, the top just didn't provide enough coverage for  me and im not big at all. Super cute swim suit for those who don't mind the smaller top.

The a little small compared to bottom. It will work but if you have larger breast I would not recommend this swim top. I'm a B and considering returning because I'm affraid my boobs are going to pop out. Lol"
"quality was ok, got a hole in the butt really easily. fit large, always slid off."
"Size up. Not very comfortable to me either, but bought my mom same pair and she loves them"
This was a very cute costume for my 2 year old son. The quality wasn't too bad but the strings on the front were very cheaply made and they pulled right off! The hat is adorable!! My other complaint was that the costume did not come with a tail. Other than that my son looked adorable in it!
i like the quality but pants and shirt was small
not to bad but not very compfy!
"This is a pretty watch, but it is very heavy and bulky."
"Came with a hole in the leg, I other wise like them and they seem warm but I hadn
't even taken it out of the packaging when I spotted the hole."
Did not stick as well as I thought it would. Not sure if perhaps how I was trying to use it was not a regular usage method.
"I thought this was made of plastic. Turned out to be cardboard. The assembly instructions were a bit confusing, too. But once set up, it serves its purpose of providing a neat storage for your purses. Looks sturdy as well, never had a problem since setting it up 3 months ago."
Nice but the metal mesh back proved uncomfortable to wear. Returned it
Just to bright in color. Other then that. Not a bad shoe. Returned.
"This is a very nice-looking watch. It has a simple, clean design that I really like. The mesh band is comfortable, and the watch is very lightweight. It works well with formal, semi-formal, and casual attire. Unfortunately, this is a rather expensive watch ($175 when I got mine) and the watch lacks some quality control. I don't know if this is normal for the watch model, or if I just got one that has issues. If my watch is a fair representation then I would estimate a fair price for this watch to be in the $60-$70 range. If this watch were sold in that range Id easily give it a 4 to 5-star rating.

Heres what I like about the watch. In short, the design and appearance of the watch are fantastic. The watch face has a clean, minimalist design that makes the watch easy to read. The case design is also simple: round, lightweight and thin. It sits well on the wrist, and hides very easily in a shirt sleeve. The mesh band feels nice and allows the skin under the band to breathe. Overall this watch is a pleasure to look at and wear.

Timekeeping is very accurate.

Water resistance is 3 ATM, which is good for splashes only. This is not surprising, considering how thin the watch and its crystal are. This is a bit disappointing considering the price, but this watch isn't meant for sport or work wear.

Heres what I feel makes this watch overpriced.

For starters the watch is *designed*, and probably partly manufactured in Denmark. The band is from China, and the quartz movement from Japan. The documentation didn't say who the manufacturers are, but Im guessing the movement is probably a simple yet accurate one purchased in bulk.

The watch lacks some quality control. On my watch the second hand is not aligned with the markings on the watch face. For instance the second hand lands to the left and right of the 12:00 mark, but not on it. The minute hand wobbles. Sometimes it jiggles when the second hand moves. This might be acceptable on a watch that costs $50 or less, but not one that cost $175.

The date window is surrounded by a ring of chrome or similar shiny material. This reflects light into your eyes when looking at the date and makes it hard to actually read it. The actual date numbers are small. If your eyes aren't too good at seeing things up close you may have trouble reading them, even without reflections from the date window."
"These are my school colors, they are pretty comfortable, but they don't let your feet breath. Otherwise, okay for the price."
"Not flattering,don't like style"
"If you're traveling and you don't want to check-in your bag but you have a lot of stuff to carry then this is the bag for you. It has lots of space and you can carry it on your back like a back pack. the only thing I didn't like about it is it doesn't have a lot of compartments. It has like two pockets on the inside and one on the outside, would've been cool to have compartments to separate all of my stuff. But for this low price you really can't complain. The material looks a little plasticy so I don't know how long it'll last but it does the job in the mean time."
"Old one ruined three credit cards in six months. They replaced my wallet with a new model, and this one seems like it'll be a bit easier on the cards than the old one. Customer service was awesome as always. Still, only bumping it up to a three star. It just seems like maybe the awesome qualities of Saddleback products don't translate that well to wallets... leather is too thick and the wallet's just not as versatile as the more pedestrian offerings from other manufacturers. Perhaps glove leather is better than 100 yr quality leather for wallets."
Im 5ft and 126lbs I ordered a size 6 and it fits perfectly. The height is perfect with heels on as well my only complaint is it came ripped at the seam on the bottom of the dress. I need it for a military ball next week though so Im just having a friend fix it for me instead of exchanging it. The material is very nice but the stitching isn't the best.
"Beautiful dress, but too small. 4x states to only be a size 22? Really?"
"You can't miss with Frye, but these did not work for me. The style was too masculine and I was uncomfortable walking in them."
No good as I think
"Awesome bag, but size in description was wrong. Returned for larger size."
Tight at the waist.
"These shoes looked better online. The color was really pretty, but there is not enough fabric on the shoe to show off the pretty color. And it looked weird on my feet. These were returned"
"I like it a lot, but the seams are not stretchy enough for when you put it on"
"I'm questioning if this is 100% cashmere because it feels a little scratchy, like there is another wool blended in.  Fabric is also very thin.  I paid around 25.00 and will keep them but won't buy another.  My other 100% cashmere sweaters are super soft. This is meh."
"The frame color, and fit are awesome. The lenses are just a tint, but my issue with lenses is that everything in view when wearing glasses is fuzzy. Quality frames, cheap lenses."
"The top part material is way to ridge, I wish would be soften. But I love the shoes and the colors."
The neck area widens out with a few uses.  Thus the two knocks.
"The cup fit was good, but there's a bit of extra room with the band. It's not terrible. I just prefer a tighter fit."
"THe material is a little cheap, not very soft, even after washing"
"good compression and sturdy pantyhose material. i didn't like the closed toe, it's too constricting and makes my toes curl and sore in the shoe. decided to get open toe stockings after trying this."
"It fits fine, but it is completely stretchy, so it shows every little bulge you MIGHT have. They're not for me, but they might work for someone else."
A little small for a normal man's head.
looks nice but doesn't fit properly
"Yes, it's big.  And heavy.  So far, it functions glitch free, and the fit and finish are better than I expected at this price.  Don't believe for a second the ""list price.""  If this watch ever sold for $695.00, I'd eat my hat.  But, for an $80 watch, it's a solid buy."
Great for the price but like other people have said it leaves little specs behind of fabric. I didn't expect it to be high quality for the price and it was great for the hour or two my son actually wore it. I'd buy it again knowing that.
Caillou is obnoxious and whiney.  So are we when we lose our Caillou toys.  They never seem to go back into the bag.
"I didn't have any problems with the fit of these as others mentioned, but I stil wouldn't recommend these shoes. The first day I wore these walking for a couple of miles, my feet hurt, my legs hurt, my thighs hurt. I'd never had these problems before. Over time, it wet away, but I have found these shoes do not have much cushion (even with my own inserts--New Balance Pressure Relief) or support. They have some, so they are wearable for just everyday wear, barely, but, in my experience, they are not really suitable for exercising or walking long distances."
I love these leggings. Despite the fact that they are not seamless as stated. They are very comfortable and feel great. The only problem I found is they tend to sag and I find myself pulling them up more often then not. I am 5'2 105lbs with very long legs. I bought the smallest size and was a bit sad to find them to sag. hoping they will shrink in the wash. If so I will purchase again!
"I really like this style.  The Carnevale  brand does not seem to use as many crystals as some others I have seen, which is a little disappointing.  If you look closely, you will see that the purple paint supplies a lot of the color instead of the color of the crystals.  But it is pretty anyway; don't know how durable it will be.  Very sparkly, and get many compliments about it."
"The purse is unique and pretty, although I was disappointed in the color.  In the picture it looks like what I would call a salmon color.  Some reviews described it as a salmon color as well.  When I received it it was more of a red-orange, which makes it hard to match with most clothing."
Glad I was able to get these at a big discount. They run a bit small. I'm an 9 1/2 D the 10's I ordered are borderline. I'll probably try 11's next time.
"I do not get the sizing on the label of this suit at all. The label says US 14-16.  XL/XXL. I ordered a XXL (to be safe) which fits me perfectly and I am a size 18. Otherwise the suit is very flattering and the straps stay well in place for doing water aerobics and swimming laps. I've been told the design makes my waist look smaller. Yay!

Update 1/19/17 I wear this 2-3 times a week for water aerobics and the suit had faded unbelievably. The blue is now mostly yellow with a couple patches of minty green color. The yellow and pink have also faded ( the yellow is now very pale, wheat color and some black is now grey. Just wanted to give warning the colors don't hold up to pool water at all after less than four months. It still fits fine though and hasn't stretched out."
Fit across the chest and arms were tight.  If you are big chested it may fit snug.  I am a 40DDD and the XL fit to snug.  Other then that it a very nice coat.
"Beautiful bra but too small, I don't understand though because I wear 34H so I ordered that size but the cups were way too small! I'm confused. So unfortunately I had to return it. :("
Way too small. My boyfriend is only 5'8 and they came to his ankles! There was also a couple of inperfections that were ok considering the price I paid. However the length is terrible. The material is nice and soft though. I was going to return but my boyfriend decided to keep them as he onlywears them in bed. However will NOT buy these again or recommend
Run very small! Got my size and there is no way I can fit into them :(
"material was very thin, seemed almost like they were disposable, but they were pretty"
"I bought these underwear for my daughter who typically wears a size 14 and these were HUGE! I'm a women's size 4 and these fit me perfectly so, you get the idea of just how large they are. I don't think I'll be buying underwear on the internet again."
Doesn't stay on ear  tho very pretty. It just falls off of ear and is vary difficult to get back on.
"I read the reviews and ordered a size 10 (5'9 and 145lbs). There was a lot of room in the boob and underarm area, and I did not like the ruffle at the bottom. I ended up sending this dress back. I did order a different dress from this seller, purple with lace at the top, and it was a keeper for sure!"
I like these tops they fit very nice and give some cover to the arms
"I absolutely love these pants! I have recently lost a lot of weight so my skin has quite a bit of cellulite and saggy, however these really hide that a lot.... they make my thighs look smooth and sexy! So thrilled that I got these! And they fit really well! When I got them out of the bag I was positive they be too small because they look a lot smaller than they are.. But when you put them on their stretchy and really hug your body"
"I bought this bra earlier this year in 34 DDD and I am actually wearing it as I type this.  It's comfortable, very supportive and durable.  I highly recommend it, if you're looking for something comfortable and supportive.  I also bought http://amzn.to/2icn65i and http://amzn.to/2iBYpSL They're both very supportive for a gal big up top."
Asics just fits awesomely well. Never had a sneaker that fit so perfectly right. Thanks again Amazon.
super cute booties!  fit well and are comfortable!
"Mad very well, looks good, great charity"
I felt pretty wearing this to an SCA event. The quality is beyond anything costume you will find.
Love it!! Love that it has a bra closure in back. Fit is great. Feels comfortable. Would buy again!
just like the picture!
"Soft material, comfortable sox.  Wash inside out--no pilling."
"I bought 3 and they are very comfortable, fit as expected and warm. Will definitely buy more."
"The best ever. Took care of the problem completely. Our dandruff was over the top are falling from the top constantly. Now, there is none. Use three times per week."
"Great quality, beautiful. I definitely will be buying more from this seller."
"looks great good color combos it is nice and tight and shaped nice :) im 5""5 and petite ordered a small I love this shirt :)"
"Really like the purple stripe pattern in this sock.  Fits snugly, but has a decent weight to it.  My feet aren't too cold nor do they sweat. Good buy."
Fit well. Comfy waistband
Nice look. It is much darker than the picture. More green.
The colors and image design are fantastic on this pullover.  It is a little small for a one size fits all so I only gave it 4 stars.  Make sure you size it appropriately if you plan on gifting this as I did.
"Color is beautiful, but too large for my daughter. If you have a tall girl, this seems to be a better fit."
"If you are just getting started in customizing watches (Like I am), this is an AWESOME case holder for the price.

FYI, you WILL need one of these if you want to protect your case from scratches when opening the case back. I recommend getting a case back wrench as well.
I got this one and I'm thrilled about it; http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZLWFO6/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

The nylon pins are adjustable to accommodate different case sizes and the material quality is pretty decent. I recommend lubricating the threads on the screw mechanism before use as the threads were not perfectly cut. After lubing and running it in and out a few times, it felt great."
Nice order up half size
"The shoe was beautiful!  I ordered it for my daughter to wear at her wedding.  The color was perfect, unfortunately it was too small and no longer available in purple. I had to return it."
"It took three orders (two returns), but I finally got a pair that fit, and they are very nice shoes. The heel is high enough to make your legs look good (not old lady style, and I should know, because I'm an old lady), but not so high that you have to take baby steps. I usually wear a 7, but sometimes, in a pump, I will get a 6.5 because I like them to fit more snug and not slip on my heels. I started with a 7 and I could put two fingers behind my heel in the gap. Exchanged them for a 6.5, but also ordered a 6 at the same time so I didn't have to wait. The 6.5 was better, but still big-ish around the heel and I would have had to put a pad in there. The 6 is nice and snug, not tight, just snug enough that I don't feel like it's going to slip off. I can walk easily in these shoes, and while I'm not walking around town shopping for a whole day in them, they are very comfortable for an evening out."
"True to size, however, the ruching on the back is awkward on my backside..."
one of my best shoes i have
These glasses are so clear and sharp. They are as clear as much higher priced glasses. They also come with a hard case that protects the glasses perfectly. I got the brown glasses and love them!
"I love Ecco shoes, own about 6 pair and will continue to add more over the years. Ecco's just are always the highest quality in fit and finish. These are true to size as all other of the brand and very light comfortable. Perfect with denim or shorts. Casual while still having a low key style; unlike the fluorescent sports shoes that seem to be all the rage today."
"Like it. Nice color. Looks durable.  I may have been ok with the smaller size. I chose a Medium for a 33"" waist."
"Super cute! I usually wear a 6.5/7 so I went with a 7, but my toe (comfortably) comes to just about end of the shoe. I'm not sure if its something that really needs sizing up for, but maybe if you plan on wearing thicker socks or are on the larger end of a size, it might be something to consider."
"Fairly thin, but I'm a guy so I don't know if that's normal. Bought it for my fiancee. Makes her breasts look more amazing when she wears my favorite bra with it."
"After going to two stores and not finding a lace up shoe for my daughter in her size, we went to online.  She loves these shoes!  Hopefully now she will be able to learn to lace her shoes."
I'd buy again.
"Great shoes for a good price.  Can wear everyday or with a summer dress.
Not great support,  but they don't claim that."
"Fits as expected, very flattering, length is to top of hips so not to long.  Very comfortable.  There is no bra cups or under wire just extra lining and the top tier covers you completely.  Very happy with purchase, this is made well and good quality."
My Carly looked so sweet in this and it fits to a t. So if ya want it to last a little longer you might consider ordering one size up.
"I wore these shoes to my 40th high school reunion.  I danced and stood non-stop for six hours straight and they still felt comfortable!  Not to mention that they are absolutely sparkly, gorgeous and fun to look at!!  My feet almost always hurt so I thought these shoes were amazing- I love them!!!!  Perfect little high heel and enough cushion to take the pounding from jumping and dancing!!"
Excellent craftsmanship beautiful shiny exactly what I expected
"Durable, comfortable and easy to put on for my 5 year old daughter.  Will purchase again in the future."
Love it! We got it for a party we never made it to and now use it as pj's. Super comfortable and fun to wear! :)
"Nice all purpose, low rise crew socks.  These go up to about 1/4 on my calf, so be aware.  They are comfortable to wear when going to the gym or playing basketball.  I initally bought the general Hanes crew socks on the first page of a ""crew socks"" search, and those were atrocious.  These are so much softer and provide excellent support for long physical sessions."
"This is a great pair of shoes, I would make sure that you get 1/2 size larger than.  This is my second pair and the sizing is important.  Excellent shipping, one day with Prime!"
"I love the deep, rich, wine color...I love the weight of the cotton...When I put my feet up on the ottoman, there's enough drape to cover my legs...And the hood REALLY keeps you warm....This is a GREAT robe!"
Cute but they run a bit small.
"These are the most comfortable sandals ever. I absolutely love these. I got a few pairs for my mom as well and she is extremely picky, and she absolutely loves them too. I have pretty slender feet and they fit me well and she has pretty wide feet and they fit her well as well. They are vet light weight, soft and squishy. I rarely get this excited about shoes, but these are special, very comfy and stylish."
"So lovely! Light, airy and delightfully witchy. Perfect for summer. It would be hard not to fit into it since it's a kimono and they're already very roomy, so no complaints there. It doesn't look cheap, which I was worried about. The material is not heavy, it's lacy and thin so if you're looking for something to keep you warm, this won't do much. The only thing you have to watch for is the stringy bits because they have a tendency to get caught on stuff which is to be expected when you have a bunch of long fringe. I'll also be taking care when washing it. Probably will just hand wash. Great purchase. This kimono will be my go-to cover up for the rest of the summer!"
"Was a bit concerned about the fit after reading these reviews. I wear an 8, I ordered an 8 and it fit perfectly. I'd suggest tightening the straps if yours are a bit large, although I didn't need to so I don't if that works. The shoes are suede offset by leather straps as advertised. It's worth noting I could not find these shoes ANYWHERE for less than $60 and some places went as high as $100."
"I wish these had more rounded (i.e., less pointy) ends and were available solely in the 1-3/4"" length, but I knew these factors going in so did not deduct stars.  The stays are thick - comparable to the Brooks Brothers ones I have (except for the pointier ends) so I'm pleased with the quality. The carrying container is handy."
"I had a thumb ring and lost it, and my thumb just felt naked without it. I finally gave up on looking for it and decided to replace it.

Stars have kind of become my trademark. When I go camping, I draw a star on things, and everyone knows they're mine.

So, I was really happy to find this ring! It's really beautiful!

When I first got it, it didn't spin really easily, and it felt sort of grainy and rough when I did spin it. But after a few days, it spins easily and a lot more smoothly. I really like this! It's a really nice design."
Good quality for such a smokin' deal! These were much sturdier and nicer than I expected for the price. We had great fun with these.
I'm 6' tall and average build and these fit great!  Nice and opaque.
I find that Keen shoes are very consistent in the sizing. I can order the same size each time and they fit fine.
I rarely see my husband pleased with material things. He was pleased with this one.
"These take some breaking in, which surprised me.  But it was worth a week of blisters to me.  The style is unbeatable."
Very Nice Vest
"This product was just right. I ordered the red colored one and I have to say, it's perfect for sleepwear.
Thanks!"
Not the best quality fabrics but my granddaughter likes it so we'll keep it. I do like the colors of the plaid shorts and lavender shirt.  I guess for $9.99 I got what I expected.  It arrived with wrinkles in the shirt and shorts.  The collar on the shirt doesn't want to lie down.  I haven't washed it yet so we'll see how it turns out.  I have a feeling it will have to be ironed to smooth out all the wrinkles.  My granddaughter just turned 2 and is small for her age so this is a little bit big on her.  I'm hoping she'll grow into it by the time summer arrives.
"great jacket, love it"
"My nephew loved the boots. Very well made, very sturdy for rough kids."
Second pair of these. I do like them
"These are very comfortable and they really help with my planar fasscitis. However the insole in them blows and provides zero cushioning. It will be replaced. Also, for some reason, the shoes are not totally symmetrical. One of them is wider than the other and is visibly not write the same.

Edit: I forgot to mention these run about a half size small. I own another pair of kelsos in a different size and a 6 was fine, my normal size. I needed a 6.5 in this style."
"Cozy and warm, love them."
"This is a great costume.  It's just like the picture, except the yellow isn't quite as neon in real life (which is nice) and there is a thin yellow trim along the bottom of the blue shorts.  The costume fit a larger-framed guy, and came down about to his knees.  It had a slight crease running top-to-bottom and another across the chest, but it wasn't very noticeable and could probably be flattened out with something heavy."
"I purchased (2) pairs of Fila Women's tennis shoes, this one and then Fila Women's Memory Proficient White/White/Metallic Silver Sneaker 7 C - Wide, both are very nice but the other ones are just a bit wider and more comfortable."
I'm thinking...
"There are no others. You must wear 180's if you desire the best. My man & I love these. Both of us get 2 new pairs every year. Not that they break, we just love them!! Keeps out all the cold, sturdy, stylish and the fit it great!!"
I thought it wasn't the right shade to match my dress but it was & I didn't have to return it My boyfriends loves it
"Traveling overseas can be challenging to keep everything in its place and organized.  Luggage locks are needed since the disparity between the Haves and Have-nots are larger in some countries and the theft from unlocked baggage is simply too tempting.  So these will not keep out the determined thief just the opportunistic thief.  So finding the keys to all of the locks can be a challenge in itself.  Having all 4 locks keyed to the same key was a solution.  My wife did lose a key but I could open her locks, so all was fine."
"These tights are so elegant, comfortable, and pretty.  They fit great and Im glad I bought them."
Arrived on time. Cute
These shoes are awesome. I like absolutely everything about them. I regret wasting so much money on nikes over the years.
Pretty looks expensive
Very nice and comfortable shoes!
"I read reviews before I buy anything and I will tell you these boots are exactly what customers said they were. The boot is very nice looking, warm and durable, fits great and they were delivered before the expected date . I bought them for my son and he loves them. My husband liked them so much I am buying another pair for him. I recommend to buy these!"
"Beautiful dress! I'm great aunt, mama niece loved it."
"I got this onesie for my friend for Christmas. She is about 5.5-5.7 feet tall, slim girl. I got her a medium grey one and it fit her perfectly, just like on the picture. I believe the small would work also but I wanted it to be loungie and loose. I tried it on too, I am 5.7, athletic build and it was super comfortable! The onesie feels and looks as if you could wear it outside with nice high top snickers or Vans. I am seriously considering getting myself one just like that. Love it!"
Very cute shoe my daughter wanted to sleep in them. They do run about 1/2 size too big.
"Excellent fast service, beautiful pin...I would have liked to have been able to add a gift note to the recipient
....."
beautiful product it  is well made highly crafted and well thought product. love it i am glad i bought it. i had points on my prime card so i paid less for buying this now i am definitely buy more products from this seller.
Was a gift. My friends daughter looks adorable in this though.
"Nice and long, was able to use on tall boots"
Top notch products from the NF. They just know what they are doing!
it fits great!!
"I'm size 10 and usually order a Medium, but Small was the only size available. Tried it and it fits great"
This is my third pair.  I love Clarks.  I wear this brand exclusively.  I give it 5 stars!!!!
Great wallet with zipper!  I love the way the color of this wallet is the same as the color of coffee beans.  Nice color!
"These shoes are G-R-E-A-T they are comfortable and soft. I am protective that these shoes stay off the ground, they are my favorite slippers of all time. I will be purchasing another pair and even want some for my 11 year old daughter. LOVE LOVE these shoes."
These are cute and well made. Not sure why it's so hard to find plain white ruffled socks in stores these days. Glad I found them here!
"It looks gorgeous! Kinda surprising at how small it is, but then again it is for your septum and it needs to be that little. I'm being very careful about where I put it when it's not in my nose for this reason.

It came in a small baggie, in a larger baggie, inside a large padded envelope. It didn't come in a box.

My only issue was that it felt like the opening was a little too wide for my comfort. It went on fine, and stayed on; the width still made me worried that if I moved a certain way, it'd fall out. I ended up adjusting it with some pliers (easy to do)."
"Looks great, looks even better on but my little guy hates anything semi ""puffy and insulated""."
"I really think the watch looks nice, and I wear it almost everyday. It is very loud though, so when I sleep, I always put it in a drawer. Also, the watch face got a bit scratched up, and I've only had it for one month..."
As with all Gerber clothes we have used this is a bit small but still adorable:)
"i ordered a size 9, but should have gotten an 8 1/2, i returned them and will be ordering the correct size, they just looked a little baggy around the ankles. otherwise very cute and lovely boot for the price. was sad to return them for that reason but i would be upset with myself if i kept them running a bit large and just tried to accept it. cant wait to get the return done so i can get mine for real!"
Nice heels
I love my shoes it's make my feet look sexy
My doughter loves this hat
"Finally got the right size! Love these tennis, my son loves them too. Shipping was fast!"
"For the price, these shoes are awesome!"
"True to size, nice feeling to the skin. Great look and quality."
The best product we bought on Amazon for our newborn. We use them everyday - keeps baby warm and does not fall off. A bit expensive but worth every penny.
best suit
they are lovely I am wearing them most evenings for supper
Bought this for my guy because he broke the other one I got him
Collar is too short and floppy.
Shower Gifts
"The picture here is wrong too. This is just a regular sweat, not 1/4 zip cadet collar which is what I wanted. However it's a nice shirt so I gave it to my husband and he likes it, Runs very large and doesn't shrink."
"This dress is very cute and comfortable. The material is stretchy. This dress can be dressed up or down. I normally wear a 10-12. I ordered a M in this dress, and it fits fine."
"I love this little clock!! It looks so modern. I love a HUGE number face that is easy to read, and this delivers.

I didn't need to use the enclosed instructions at all. This is a VERY intuitive product. The switches on the back very clearly show which setting is for changing the time, the alarm, or the date. Then there are 3 buttons you use to change the hour, minute, etc. It's all very easy.

It takes 3 AAA batteries. The slot very clearly shows how to insert them and the compartment cover is very sturdy. Speaking of which, this clock is hardy. I did drop it on accident. No problems at all. The screen didn't even flicker.

The alarm is great. It works reliably, the noise isn't TOO blaring and annoying. The snooze button on the top is big and easy to find when you're tired. The back light on this (which you activate by pressing the snooze button) is superb! It is just bright enough to see, but the light is pale enough not to kill your eyes in the middle of the night.

I love this so much! It's exactly what I was looking for. When I was offered the chance to buy this product at a discount to offer my review, I JUMPED at the opportunity! I had been looking for a great alarm clock for my husband's night stand and this delivers in each and every way. It's trul a great little product."
"Fits well. Kind of cheap, the ""polish"" the back of the ankle and the toes are coming off so you see a lot of white, it looks like paper. But it's great for use once in a while."
"This was my first pair of Chacos. We're going on a family vacation to Disney World in May and I wanted some sandals that would be comfortable to walk around in all day. I have several pairs of Teva flip flops and, while I love them, they hurt my arches after a while. I tried on some women's size 7 Chacos in the store and I loved them, but they were really expensive. When I left the store I searched for cheap Chacos online and found a blog recommending buying kids Chacos if you can wear a women's 8 or under. I measured my foot and found that I would need a kids 5. I ordered these shoes and it turns out that a kids 5 is identical to a women's 7! I bought these for literally half of what I would have paid for adult sizes and they fit exactly the same. I love my Chacos!!!"
Super FUN!!!!!
I ordered this for my boyfriend because he was looking everywhere for a Chelsea grin shirt as it's his favorite band. He was definitely surprised but really loves this shirt. Fits him perfectly and arrived on time. He wears it all the time now
Love these things. Ill be getting the brown/brown next time tho. The brown on white is kinda goofy looking
Beautiful shoes.. very comfortable!
my dog ate three pairs of birkenstocks so I decided to try these.  They are rubber so good for walking in the wetness in that they won't get soaked.  I normally get a size 41 birkenstock and got a size eight in these and they are a bit small or they fit perfectly I should say.  I am used to the bigger feel of the birkenstock so would probably get a 9 next time.  They have pebbly footbed surface which is a bit annoying but I guess it keeps your foot from sticking to the insole.  I don't like how the buckles are arranged as well as on the birkenstocks.  I might opt for the one with no buckles next time.
Perfect. Just as picture and described!
"This fits great, and washes up very nicely. I plan on buying a few more when I highly recommend this product for colder days."
"After reading other reviews, I am glad that I bought these slippers a size larger. There is just enough room to wear socks. They are very light as well. They don't hang off your feet or flop around when walking. The fuzzy upper is super soft and velveety to the touch. These slippers are definitely for indoor use only. I haven't found the need to wash them yet, so I am not sure how they will hold up after being laundered. This slipper provides some cushion and keeps my feet toasty. Would absolutely purchase another pair. I gave these 4 stars because of the size discrepancy and the fact that the sole of the slipper could use some extra protection if one needs to step outside to grab the paper."
"This watch does everything I want in a watch, and then some.  I really only need to tell time (to the second), but the day and date are handy.
The stopwatch feature is difficult to use - not important to me, but it is one of the ""features"" of the watch.  The four side buttons on the watch don't react to my finger pressure - I must use my fingernail or my pen to depress them enough to activate them.  The alarm is so quiet that I cannot hear it - unless I am holding the watch to my ear.  As with all the watches I have tried, the light fails to light up the information sufficient to read it at night.
I suppose the new plastic bands wear better than leather, and they are no doubt cheaper than stretch bands - but I don't find them comfortable.
Since the watch tells time - to the second - accurately and has an easy-to-read large display, I am content with it."
"Very comfortable nursing bra.
Was skeptical was first based on my experience with others. After trying one I decided to make a second purchase (current review) because of the level of comfort and support it gives.
It is also very easy to use while feeding.

I would recommend to any breast feeding mother looking for a good, comfortable, supportive and easy to use bra."
Very well made and very nice looking!
These are my 12 yr old's first pair of running shoes and he LOVES them.  He runs about 5 miles daily and has had zero issues.  They wear well and provide proper support.
"Very soft maxi skirt. I love it. I bought two, the navy blue and jade in xl and it fits beautiful. I plan on buying more colors."
"Fit is ok.  Probably not the best choice for my body type, but comfortable and stylish"
"I bought a pair of these this weekend (not on Amazon) totally on a whim. They're absolutely adorable - and perfect for the beach! They're linen so they're automatically a little wrinkly (but on linen that looks good, generally). I bought them in white and they're a bit see-through but that's not a problem if you're wearing them over a bikini bottom. If you're going to wear them as shorts, nude underwear makes them much less see-through looking. I'm 5'4"" and 126 lbs so I'd normally buy these in a Large (they're JUNIORS sizes, after all). I somehow ended up buying the Medium, though, and they fit perfectly! They're tiny little shorts though, just like in the picture. If you're my size and you want them to be a little looser (and not just for the beach) I'd def try buying the Large :) Also, wash them on Gentle since the draw string on the front gets a little tattered if you don't."
"Nice, smooth and comfortable.  I like sleeveless T's and Hawaiian shirts and this style fits right in with that group.  I will likely be getting more of these as time goes on."
"IT's pretty big for 2T, but it still looks cute and wears well."
"Love this!! It fits perfectly and make my booty look awesome. It's a thick good, quality fabric, bonus!"
"Beautiful black heel , great fit, easy walking, I wear a 6 1/2 , love these."
"Originally ordered a 7, too small, ordered an 8 and they were too big. Can't win them all, he'll grow into them!"
I buy lots of shoes here.  Since they are made in China you would think they would be cheaper in Asia.  You would be wrong.  Buy them here before you travel.
my son runs track these she are very comfortable to run in he says that it feels like your are running on air. They are true to size my sons other running shoes was a 91/2 order a 10 and they fit perfect
Omg I am loving these keys perfect .. valentines gift.
"I am in love with this urn necklace, it is about the size of a quarter. A truly meaningfull piece of jewelry."
"This is the best bag ive ever had; except for one problem. The dividing cloth between the 2 main large compartments is just a very thin, see through, piece of cloth that probably won't hold up very long, i do hope i am wrong about it. Otherwise, it is so roomy and has so many pockets, very useful. Great color and texture goes perfect with a pair of boots i have and really just about all my clothes. The Ash color matchesvwell. I definitely recommend."
Beautiful. Perfect size
Happy with the product.
"This I bought due to back pain and lower back pain and it sure helps,  Better than those compression ones they sale and will probably end up buying more,"
"Not only did I use this bag as my beach bag in Mexico but as my carry-on as well.  Yes, it fits and meets the requirements.  I only gave it 4 stars because it was just a tad TOO big."
"At first, my wife thought of it as ""no special watch"" - however in real, this watch is 10 times more beautiful than on picture, and she said all her friends are envious now.. great buy, highly recommended."
Was I gift for my nephew and he loved it.
"For everything less formal than a church wedding or the opera, and in all weather other then deep snow, Venice by KEEN shoes are the ONLY shoes I've worn for the past ten years.  They are the most comfortable shoes I've ever tried."
"I love these sandals.  They are extremely comfortable and look great with casual and business casual clothes.  CROCS tend to run big in size for me, but these run true to size."
Great quality as usual
Favorite pair of scrub bottoms ever
"Love! These are lace with a flower print. I ordered a size larger just because of the boy short style, and glad I did. I think would be great  as cotton. Lots of colors."
"Perfect fit, typically have a difficult time finding something to accommodate my chest.
That was not the issue with this shirt, it fit perfectly.
Held up to the heat of adding iron on vinyl, washes well too."
"Bought these for my son who is 5'2"" and they are pretty long on him. Other than that, he likes them. Very comfortable, he lounges around for hours very well in them!"
I LOVE IT. Everywhere I go people are impressed by this hat.  Just wet it and form it and it is a great hat.  I have had one for three years and it has literally been all over the world with me.  Great hat.
Great fit and just what I wanted!  I use these as a costume accessory and they keep my hands free. The loop that goes around the finger is delicate. If you tear it it's an easy fix to re-sew it.
Beautiful wallet!
"Great, perfect for wirk over a hoodie"
Feminine and sleek.
Nice addition to professional wardrobe. Might be a little too bright for the corporate world. I would recommend this item
"I'm a true size 7 shoe and sometimes 7.5 if the shoe runs small. After buying the lucky brand Basel boot in size 7.5 (based on reviews) I determined I could've bought my usual size and been fine. So I bought these boots in my usual size (7) and I'm pleased that I did. They were snug at first but didn't squish my toes at all and they loosened up after only two wears. Now they feel just right and if I had sized up (7.5) I'm sure my heel would slip out of the boot while I walk because of the pull-on design and loose ankle. Adorable boot, just wish they had the bourbon color in my size! Please restock!"
"Overall I love these boots!!! Especially for the price. They are perfect for rainy weather or snow. I even wear these on my motorcycle and they are the perfect boots for it! They do run a little large. I typically wear a 9, and I definitely have a little extra room, but nothing crazy. Would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a cute wedge boot."
This is the second one I've purchased because I liked it so much. No sunburns and dries very quickly. The fit is great. The price is great. The product is great. Look no further.
Fits OK...Just didn't like it.
Loved them! They are still like new!
Very nice shoes thank you.
"Falls below the knee, very light lining inside. Soft cotton. So far I am extremely happy with the purchase."
"If this fit closer to what it should have it would be 5 stars. It's VERY soft and warm, my daughter is in love with it. Just wish it were a little bigger. It came fitting snug and I ordered a size larger than she normally wears."
"I am a Dansko girl, plain and simple.  If you have a bad back and haven't tried this brand, give it a shot.  I have advanced scoliosis, and I'm a teacher, so the shoes on my feet definitely influence whether it's a standing or sitting kind of day.  Danskos usually guarantee that I can stay on my feet with little back discomfort.  I have multiple pairs of Danskos and have never been disappointed.  And on top of all that great news, these shoes are even CUTE!!  They last and last, have excellent workmanship, and come in so many styles, colors, etc."
"I like this umbrella so much that after my first one was misplaced, ordered the same one to replace it!"
Excellent quality - so happy with these and love that they are available in wide sizes.
"I bought two of these wallets to choose from, one pink, and one coffee as I was thinking the pink might be too bright. But I LOVE it, it's a deep rose pink that I believe will get darker with age. Gorgeous!

Before I could return the darker one my cousin fell in love with it, so I gave it to her for Xmas; than her sister saw hers and wanted one of her own, so I got her the orange.  In future I shall just direct people to Amazon or I'll have no money left to actually put in my lovely wallet!!!

The design and quality are great, you can easily see that it's good quality leather (which is why everyone who sees it wants one!), it has a large amount of storage for cards, money, receipts, etc, and my Galaxy Note 4 fits in the pocket behind the zipper section (access under the front flap) quite comfortably.  (The fit for the phone was a bit tight at first, but the wallet is real leather and will stretch just a little to conform to what you put in it.)

If I had to find a fault it would be that they need a double press-stud fastening to accommodate closing the front flap when the wallet is full to bulging (my mother would just tell me to carry less c**p in it. :-D ).  All in all, a great, very attractive wallet that I look forward to using for many years."
"It is one of my sons favorite shirts. He says he's a super hero and hell save the day because he's wearing this shirt.

Sincerely,

Mrs. ""I"""
This watch was purchased for a friend. She is very happy with it and wears it every day.
"My third pair of sirens! Why switch, if they work? Each pair usually lasts me about 4 years of constant use. I like this new version, because there is a bit less mesh, so they should be perfect for winter snow. They always fit right out of the box, no blisters, good arch support (I have high arches and narrow feet), ankle support, and nice thick tread. I recently started wearing thin Merino wool socks with my last pair in summer to cut down on moisture in 90 degree heat. The socks prevented any odor issues from sweaty feet. Normally I'd wear my Keene sandals in that summer heat, but needed to wear the closed toe boots for work."
"Nice, but too large."
"I wear a medium and ordered a large because these run small. The buttons will fall off, but my mom is a seamstress so it's not a big deal to get them sown back on."
"Adorable boot, but calf
 is a little tight"
Fit okay was just shorter in length than I thought.  But overall okay.
"Love to wear this blouse, it's comfortable and a bit dressy."
Got it on time. It make me feel like a million bucks. Comfy but luxurious and eye catching..love it a whole lot.
Very sexy Kitten Heel! Love the sparkle and fit! Heel height is good for wearing all day! Would recommend!
"Love it!!! Seriously!!! Freaking love this purse!!! It's perfect for u if your husband likes for you to ""hold on to this""!!! Good zippers and good quality of leather! I am not one of those ""fake"" comments they leave! This really is a good purse!!!"
Very nice I love it.....perfect side for me.
This is my fourth pair and all I can say is this is one comfortable shoe. Just give a little time to walking in them.
they are a great staple in my wardrobe and the fleece lining will keep you warm in the winter
I can't say enough good things about these shoes. I LOVE them. Trained for and ran a half marathon in these and already planning to get another pair. The color is great and they feel like you are running on clouds. Will never go back to Brooks shoes again.
"This scarf is so soft and stretchy!
It keeps me warm without being bulky.
It also is nice because it is not itchy wool. I may order new colors."
"I'm usually a 7 and rarely a 7.5 but the 7.5 fits well AND my feet look tiny. I sit, stand, and walk for my eleven hour days and these stay comfortable. I love than and want to live in them, but as others have mentioned about this brand they'll probably only last a season...the price is right and I think they're a great fall buy"
They are very comfortable and fit well!!
"I have this dress in two colors- cream and black. I bought the cream one and used it for my wedding dress. It was so comfortable so I chose to get one in black too. It can be a bit revealing, but add a cami underneath to change that based on the occasion. The material is so soft and forgiving. I just washed and dried on regular cycles and it comes out beautifully."
"Very warm and cozy! However if you do order this, please make sure you check the measurements, because they run somewhat small.
I actually ordered this for my mother. She like her jackets to be somewhat baggy, so I ordered an XL. I didn't bother to measure her and check it against the size chart, but I assumed since extra large clothes tend to be very baggy on her, it would fit.
When I received it, I unpacked it and had her try it on. She could pull the coat together but she couldn't zip it up.
So, I decided to try it on. I wear a small/medium in most coats/jackets/blouses. So I was surprised at how well this fit me. It was a little baggy in the chest and somewhat baggy in the stomach area, but other than that, it fit perfect.
The fleece inside is very soft, softer than most fleece coats or blankets you find in stores.
It's thick enough to protect me from the wind and cold, but not so thick that it feels heavy.
Personally I find it to be the perfect jogging jacket. It's warm but not bulky and keeps me warm without being too hot or stuffy.
The quality is great. I have another jacket (that's 3 times the cost of this one) that I replaced with this, because it's better in every way. The fit is better, the fabric is more soft, the fabric is stronger, and it provides more wind protection.
The fit is very stylish, the sleeves and wrists are a bit long on me (probably because of the larger size), but I prefer that.
I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased review.
Pros: Really soft
Warm
Fits well, but order a size up
Light, not too heavy
Cons: Runs small"
Very Comfortable and look great
I got this for my sister for her birthday and she loves it!
Great tees...........regularly order these...........and will continue to order in the future!
"This garment is so unique you probably will never see anyone else with it on.( except my niece, I bought her the blue one). It is so futuristic looking. whomever designed this was a genius."
Good looking tie and good quality.
"Great shoes.  This is my daughters second pair.  Her other pair are over a year old and still light up, but they are too small and getting worn out on the soles."
I bought this ring because of its 'feng shui.'  I like the look of it and it is comfortable.  The ring came on time; no problems with the seller.
I gave these as a gift to my bridesmaids and they loved them! They look exactly like the picture and they will be able to get use of these after our wedding night!! Great success.
The color is perfect and goes with my multi cam uniforms. I plan to order a few more as they are also warm and comfortable.
AS DESCRIBED AND DELIVERED ON TIME.
These feel wonderful!! They are so soft and comfy. I will definitely buy more. Actually I have these and Lularoe leggings. I like these better and they are half the price!!
Love the design. Got a medium because it was on sale and small was more expensive. Its slightly loose but still ok. Its not half bad.
"Boyfriend loved these. He's not a sandals guy but we went on a road trip to California and convinced him that he needed an ""adventure"" sandal before we go. He's glad I got them for him and he also uses them as water shoes!"
"My a solute favorite sandals! I received compliments where ever I went! If I tied them tight enough they stayed up. Generally a couple hours of wearing them they'd start sliding down, you can feel when they are starting to get loose and slide down though, so untying the back and tying them up again tighter is easy. Not exactly sure how to describe the material of the strings. Faux suede, but whatever they are, they aren't a normal string so it helps keep them up. Tying them tight ensures they stay up, but they can dig into the skin a little bit. They are worth it to me! I ordered a 6.5, they fit great. I'm generally a 6-6.5. I could have ordered the 6, but 6.5 fits good. These are so versatile and go with anything. I ordered this in the taupe. I'll be ordering more colors. Hope this review helps!"
"I, unfortunately, had to order this shirt for a funeral because I didn't have a black dress shirt.  I've bough Arrow shirts before, so I know that they fit well.  I have to say, I like the look and feel of the shirt.  The fit is perfect and the length is long enough to stay in your pants!"
"I love this suit! I am 5' 2"" and weight about 135lbs. The medium fits me perfect and I may have been able to get away with the small. There is not a lot of support in the top. I am a bit short waisted but the bottoms don't totally engulf me. The colors are just as they seem in the photo. Overall I am very pleased with this suit and will be buying more!"
"These are vey nice panties, but be careful as they are really silky and I had a little trouble keeping my palazzo pants up, especially during  standing and walking."
I was changing from pumping bra to feeding bra and vice versa every time. That too in the cold winter of January.  Bought this bra and have never looked back for pumping bra or breastfeeding bra. I don't even know where do they exist these days. This bra is very very convenient. I loved it so much that I have bought two more and I even wear this at work even though I only pump at work. It's expensive but totally worth it.
Fits very well !
"These fit great for my super hero-loving five year old.  She never complained that they hurt her ears, but I do recommend taking them out for bed and baths."
I are normally between size small and medium and order a medium. It fitted me perfect but it's very slim. Since I prefer the clothing to be a little bit loose I should have order it in Large. I'm 169 cm tall and weight 66 kg.
"Only bra that's worked for my small frame and tiny bust in my whole bra wearing life. Very comfortable and very feminine.

Update: Purchased this in August 2015 and it's now Dec. 27th 2016 and this bra is still going strong. It's in perfect condition still and is worn almost everyday. Love this bra!"
"I took my 5 yo nephew to the Marvel Live show, and he wore his cap america halloween costume so I thought it would be perfect if we matched. The shirt came in 2 days, fit perfect, and we matched just as he wanted. The price was half the price of anything I saw in the stores."
"This swimsuit is great!  The green color is darker than the picture, and its a shiny green. Its actually really pretty, just much darker than the picture.  The torso is a little short.  Id size up of course, because of the weird sizing."
Aha!
My everyday go to work shoes
Keeps our watches running. The old winder we bought was a lousy one so was hesitant to buy a new one. But this one rocks!!
"Not too 'beautiful' but it fits well and the brim does keep the sun out of my eyes.  I wet as soon as I got it - and went outdoors to water the flowerbeds - worked great.  If you get one, be sure to take the cardboard out of the inside - which I did not, but then realized it later!!!"
"These styles are AMAZING, but why are they not in leather???  I want several, but im not buying because they are not leather."
"the color is great! very cute! i love it! since it warns that it contains chemicals, i put it in the yard for several days."
Like the design. Very comfortable. My favorite bra.
"This is by far the most comfortable bra I've ever worn.  The straps are stretchy and just thick enough to lay nice and flat without 'digging in'. The fabric is super soft. The cups were seamless and would look great in a tee shirt.  I had to return it for a girls size, as my girls were a little too small for the cup size. I imagine it would fit nicely on someone else."
"love the chain!  but it is light weight, It tells you the weight.  It was perfect for my pendent!"
Great boot! I've been wearing them all winter & at times up to 3 hours of cold nights working as a yard officer. Very warm & comfortable.
"Love these leggings! Very fun, lots of compliments! I am 5'6"" and typically wear size 4-6 and they fit great.

This summer, i have warn them with a light weight black tunic and ballet flats as well as with a short black dress and high heels. I am looking forward to wearing then this fall/winter with boots and a short black dress. Very fun leggings! If you buy them, be prepared to answer this question over and over:""Where did you get those?"""
"Wore them for the first time today and everybody is admiring them, (loads of compliments).  I followed the advise of other reviewers and went 1/2 size up (thank God).  It is a really beautiful shoe, very happy with my purchase."
"I bought these to replace my Kirkland shelf bra tanks that have been discontinued, and they did not disappoint! The fit  and quality are fabulous."
Never disappointed I loved these scrubs
"Decided to buy these after my regular underwear started to not fit or cut into me bc of the bump.  At first it felt weird bc they sit so low,  but now that I'm used to them,  they are great. I no longer have band indentions on my belly"
Fun and flirty. Bought as a costume for Minnie Mouse but I can wear out to dance or out to dinner.
These are great spin shoes.  They are durable and fashionable (most spin shoes are extremely plain and not girly.)  I am always afraid of buying shoes online.  But these met my expectations in size and fit.
"I love, love my new par of shoes "
"i love this stuff, however they trick you by putting it into a canister with a raised bottom so it appears there is alot more in there than reality - don't be tricky - !"
"These nylons rock! Good tight fit and work very well on my long legs (34"" inseam). They go almost to my crotch, so works well with tall boots. Great value too!"
Loved the shoe great look works for both dressy and casual wear.
Gave to a friends son for his 3rd birthday. They're adorable. He wore them to gymnastics and they were really cute and comfy looking.
Somewhat small.  I am 7 1/2 and I ordered  size 8 to have some little room but he feeds like 7 1/2 which is OK but for next time I order the shoes which I love I will order 8 1/2. Overall 5 stars. Love them.
"Light, functional money belt, I used it well during my two-week trip. Now that I am back, I use it during my daily walk to carry my cell phone, tissues, and two tablets of glucose. Because it is so light, I don't feel I am carrying anything. Very happy to have it."
"I'll get to the technical stuff first:  Heel is 1/2"", sole is just under 3/8"", uppers are smooth leather, leather linings are a more sueded texture, and the Sbicca Keeling's have lightly padded smooth leather footbeds, though no arch support.  Soles are manmade, plastic-y feeling but fairly flexible, textured and not at all slippery on my floors.  These sandals come in at close to 3-3/4"" at their widest point (on size 7  YMMV).

I purchased these in my normal size 7 and they fit as they should lengthwise with no issues - about as you would expect.  Had I bought them in a size 8 (amazon suggestion), this particular style would have been too long.  Half sizes might want to consider a size up, though, if half sizes in this style are not available.  The width is generous but not wide - if you wear a normal width or just *very slightly* wider  your little toe should not hang over the side.  I'm actually pretty impressed with the Sbicca Keeling sandal for overall fit and comfort, especially since they are not relying on elastic to provide it.

The T-strap does not have elastic gore on the sides for flexibility of fit, however, I have an average instep and they fit me comfortably.  Since the Sbicca's are leather sandals I expect this to stretch somewhat and conform even better with wear though they are already comfortable 'as is'.  The side buckle does have a bit of elastic gore though most of it is sewn down very close to the buckle - not enough to feel sloppy while walking but enough for me to get the sandals on and off without having to use the buckle each time.  The toe post or ""thong"" is not rounded, it is flat and sewn doubled so it is thin and both sides are smooth leather making it very comfortable to wear especially if you're not used to a thong sandal.

I'm giving the Sbicca Keeling Dress sandals 5 stars overall though I would have liked to see the leather footbed match the upper especially since I bought these in ""Nude"".  I also would have liked to see a more rubberized and flexible outsole but those are just personal preferences and I wouldn't deduct stars for them.

I would not consider the Sbicca Keeling to be dress sandals as their name implies, though what you wear them with would determine that.  The woven braided styling on the upper strap does lend these sandals some interest, but they'll work with casual jeans or capris just as well as a summer dress because the styling is not overdone.  As far as fit, materials and comfort goes for a sandal of this type at it's amazon price point... good job Sbicca! :)"
Happy with the product and ordered more.
"thick, flowy skirt
true to size"
"I order these a half size big, because I like them to be a little loose after the break in period. This is the second pair I have gotten in this size and by the time they are ready to replace, they are worn to the point of being a bit looser then I like.....but before that point they fit like a glove :)"
This was a jean that I liked so much.  It fit perfect and material is great.  I am really happy to have this jean.
I love the Invicta watches.  This is my second one.
Absolutely adorable.  My daughter added it proudly to her elephant collection.....she was overjoyed!!
"Great black heel,it takes 3-4 wears to break them in."
"I disliked NOTHING about this top!  It doesn't shrink, the owls are wonky and adorable, tons of colors to match many of my scrub pants.  I love how it's not too boxy and that it dips down in the front.  The size was great, I'm a size 14 (medium-ish in the chest size) and ordered a Large.  This fit perfectly!"
"I purchased the white and black one too because i loved this one so much .. very cute, warm and comfortable not to mention love the look - have gotten a lot of compliments on it, thanks"
"Loved it, very comfy but the white is see through! Would HAVE to wear a slip of some sort because you can see right thru it. Very thing material but is super comfy"
"This bag is possibly the most beautiful thing I have ever bought on amazon. The quality is through the roof, I bought it for myself as an early christmas present and am beyond impressed. Thank you Szone!"
this was a cutie shirt for Halloween its fitted more than I like but it was cute
really great work socks
"For the price, I don't think this set can be beat. We've used it multiple times and it seems pretty durable. The various pieces have come in handy too. The tote is very large. The duffle bag is slightly larger than the carry-on size recommendations but I checked it once. I also use the little toiletry bag on every trip, the little hanger is very convenient. We haven't needed the big bag yet, but the small suitcase is the perfect carry on size. I will say I was dumb and didn't realize that four-wheel suitcases should be moved while upright, so I dragged it behind me for two trips, and now the wheels are a little messed up and uneven."
"This is my first time I have ever loved a dress so much that I went and got another in a different color.  I first got the grey, which is soft and drapey and flatters my hourglass figure.  I am a little heavy on the bottom with a thinner waist and this made me look proportional, and gives me so much confidence.  I ordered the purpley pink next and am so happy that it is more purple than pink.  GET THIS DRESS!

(I marked the fit ""somewhat large"" but it fits exactly like the model photo, drapey and not tight.)"
doesn't snap easy but otherwise great suit
"I bought this for myself as my Christmas present & I absolutely love it.  I highly recommend this watch. It is simple yet class & beautiful & even though it's not super fancy looking, it definitely catches the eye. I am going to definitely be buying more Stuhrling watches here in the near future"
Its beautifull
good quality perfect for travel ...
"Bought these a long time ago.  They're great for skating (inline and ice).  Slim fit in legs give a good feel if that's your preference, and comfortable up top.  Great pockets, and my phone doesn't slip out easily while skating as I expected it to, they're nice and deep.  Pretty good material, relatively breathable.  Cool looking too."
"for the price you can't beat um. Or the De Witt Clinton grad, know how to be stylish. The Best."
"Great fit, don't ride up, very comfortable!"
This was purchased as a gift. It arrived on time and was packaged appropriately. The charm is actually nicer than the picture represents. The surface is smooth and shiny and unflawed. I was pleased to give this charm.
"I have digital calipers for my job, so I was able to measure these myself.

They are advertised as 11mm. The smallest part, in the middle, measures 11.45mm

The flared ends measure 13.25mm. If you have true 7/16"" holes, you will find it very difficult to get these in.

I can wear normal double flared 11mm plugs loosely, however these were next to impossible to get in. Had they been just another mm thicker, I couldn't have forced them in.

Some of the reviews I have read say these run small. Not only do they not run small, but the flared ends are almost a full 2mm wider than the middle, so your holes will have to be a little looser than 11mm to accommodate them.

I would assume since these are stone, that would account for the difference in size. It is probably very difficult to get stone plugs all EXACTLY the same, within just a millimeter. Keep that in mind when ordering, yours may be slightly larger or slightly smaller than expected.

That being said, I did manage to pop them in, and I love them. No irritation from my very sensitive ears, and I haven't gotten that 'stinky cheese' film that my stainless tunnels give me. The weight is nice, and the wearable length hits me just at the right spot, not to short and not too long"
Nice soft material.  Love that the shorts have pockets.  Runs a tad small.
Very nice. Good looking.
"Adorable!!! I was a little worried about the quality, but no. They are Beautifully made! Great quality, cute box, adorable arrangement. Love!"
Good cape for a superhero or Snow White
"I'm not particularly a fan of digital watches, but I needed one for a job that required a lot of punctuality. This watch has fit the roll very nicely. It has 5 alarms in it that was just what I needed. I could have used 6, but can't find any watches with 6 alarms in it.

What made it even better was the ease of use and very readable display. I was a bit worried that the low resolution and a lot of information on the screen would be cluttered and hard to read. It is not. It's quite easy to read and find information. The resolution is enough that you don't notice any problem.

Some have complained that this is a very (overly) large watch. It is a little big, but that helps the readability of the screen. I measure the outside of the bezel from 3 to 9 at 37mm. That is not large by any standard in today's watch market. There are plenty of watches that dwarf this one. I have a medium wrist size and think it looks sized very nicely on my wrist.

It takes a little bit of learning to understand the interface and the way things work. Luckily the way things work is very consistent, so once you learn you don't have to use the manual. (Well, if you change anything every now and then.) I find the screen much clearer and easier to read than a Casio G-Shock - which was the alternative when I was buying.

I have used the Settings, Schedule, Alarm, Timer, and Time functions a lot and love them. I have not used World or Chrono. I like the amber lighting better than the blue, but that's probably a personal issue.

I've noticed that it gains about 5-10 seconds a month, but that is pretty good for a lot of quartz watches. I admit I've become spoiled by atomic watches. This accuracy is very workable. When it annoys me I set it to an atomic watch.

The Casio G-Shock line has a lot of the same functionality, but it looks very much like a sport/military/adventure watch. That didn't quite fit as well in an office environment. This Pulsar looks a lot better in a business environment.

If you are looking for a digital watch with a lot of features that is easy to read and use AND it looks semi-business, I highly recommend this one. I love mine and haven't had a bit of trouble with it. If it ever dies, I'll get another one."
Nice sandal for the money. Well made with good materials.
Nice Butt! Oh great shirt to
"I get a lot of compliments when I wear these. They fit nicely however, I have only worn them for a couple of hours at a time."
"I love it, very flattering. Already ordered another! Thinking about a third!"
"***just as described, cute and lovely***"
"I`m work for SCC inc. (RF microelectronics R&D) as production equipment maint. eng. I have to walking trough manufacturing facility all day long - up to 1,5 shifts. In this case shoes  selection look for me extremely important. My old Pazolini boots give up last month and I was try to buy (something less expensive) like Rockoport or Dockers.  Dockers was looking  more attractive and better equipped for lowest price.
  Conclusion:  Great looking, solid build, pretty comfortable and !!!Woa!!! waterproof!!!. Great stuff for this price.
  Just place order for one more pair in brown color."
"For years I worked for a New England outdoor company famous for their hunting boots.  As a result I have owned almost every boot they ever sold.  None of them were as good as a Muck Boot.  Not even close.  Muck boots fit great, are very easy to get on and off, super comfy, warm and completely waterproof.  I have two pairs exactly the same;  one for tending the animals on our farm and one for ""dress"" wear.  I love these boots."
I have a lot to put and back issues. I went to a foot specialist and the shoes were recommended .  I have been wearing these for almost 2 years. I have them in every color available. They have a nice arch in a thick sole. Since I live in Florida it works well for me to wear flip-flops here round. This is one item I would not leave home without it!
I love FitFlop shoes. I normally wear a 6-1/2 or 7 but all of my FitFlops are a 6 because they run big.
I bought these for my wife. She loves them. There well made and very comfortable once broken in.
"I've never been a huge comic book fan like a few of my close friends are but I love the Punisher, I've often dreamt of throwing on the good old Punisher skull and doing some punishment of my own on some pedophiles & rapist, the lowest form of existence!
And the no sweat fabric is really nice!"
Great big bag  perfect for weekend traveling and extra plane needs  Love the wide straps
I am going to order more.
"My favorite boots! 
Love these very comfortable and cozy!
Expensive but well worth it!
6stars"
A bit on the dark side (darker than shown) but other than that you can't beat this deal. Definitely going to buy a couple more in the other colors
High quality shoehorn with leather handle.
"I must have bought 5 different brands of long sleeved polos from amazon (required for my work uniform) and this one is by far the best fitting for an hourglass/pear shape: tapered at the waist and wider at the hips so it looks feminine. Neither too loose nor too tight. (I'm a 12/14 and ordered a L). The fabric is very soft, smooth (not ""pique""), and washes well. Have washed at least 5 times with no pilling. Downsides: the sleeves are a tad bit longer than I'd like and it doesn't come in black."
I love the color and fit of this shoe. I thought the heel would be a bit uncomfortable to walk in but surprisenly it is not bad.
I wear this on my thumb and I love it. So far none of the stones have come out and it still 'blings'! =) Update...I pretty much wear this ring all the time. Even in the shower. It's a great ring. All stones are present and accounted for so I'm really happy with this little gem. And it still blings! =)
Nice looking and good material hope to last for years
"Great socks to protect the back of my ankle from rubbing against shoes. They do shrink a bit in the dryer, so be careful."
THE most comfortable work shoe I have ever owned. 'Nough said.
"This is a great kimono! I love the fit. I'm really tall--6'1, and it hits me in the middle of my thigh, which is perfect. Great quality for the price, and the pattern is really nice."
Gave this as a gift.  My Daughter loves it.  Great Leather bag.  This product is qualilty product and well made.  The color is a nice rich chocolate brown.  You can also use this a purse or back pack.  Great size too.
My mother in law loves this and wears it all the time~  it is very comfortable and cute.
"I ended up returning the shirt. I was able to wear it but it was just a bit to snug in areas I am trying to disguise, namely my tummy area. This is no fault of the shirt or sizing of the shirt but a personal preference of mine. I believe these types of shirts will not work for what I want."
"Whether Capri or long pants, I wear these  98% of the time.  I've tried a few other brands without success.  If I didn't like Danskin so well, I wouldn't buy them.  Petite fit best but I can wear a regular small in the capris. Long pants, no. I detest hemming!"
Good quality cotton shirt.  It was bigger then what I expected (even after reviewing size chart).  However it did shrink after 1st wash and dry.
This one is a perfect fit. My favorite. Love the 3/4 sleeve and the length of the tunic overall. It has a great aline fit that is slimming and helps hide faults. I would like more colors. I bought the grey one as well.
"The tee arrived on time, was well packaged, and fit as advertised. The graphic is just okay."
I got this for my daughter in law for Christmas. She loved it and so did I so I am going to get one for me now. It is so soft and warm. It is the perfect length . This is a great scarf.
This shoe was recommended for my mother from her doctor for heel spur seems to be working for her
It is everything I thought
"As others have posted, it is a short skirt. Halloween is typically cold around here, so I ordered red leggings to go with the outfit and it worked out great. The fit was good, the dress material was thick and held up after multiple wearings. Only downside that I didn't quite think through is that most kids and teenagers didn't know what my costume was! There are several people now identified that need to sit down and watch the movie!"
Love that these are cotton which make them cooling and comfortable.  I am a 34 D and the 36 fit me perfectly.  Would buy again.
"Love this jacket although it definitely runs small. I always wear  medium in jackets; after reading the reviews,
I purchased a large size. Still, jacket is  somewhat tigher than I'd like, Many young women routinely wear tight fitting
clothes but-- i'm not, and generally, I don't! However, since this is NOT a jean jacket of yesteryear,
it has plenty of stretch, is a very comfortable fabric, has nice details and a rich deep blue color.
Won't be layering much underneath due to fit, but for now, LOVE wearing it!..maybe there's something
to wearing tighter clothes!..LOL"
Good for cooler to moderately cold weather
I just got these a day early. They are so fuzzy and soft. I wear a size 8 shoe narrow foot. They looked small. They fit perfectly. I got size l/xl. I'm very happy with them. No damage to the package. Now I need to get the pants I just saw.
"great box, stylish and functional"
COOL ITEM1
looks nice and fit well. not sure about the jacket though since this was a gift.
Really soft!!!
"Its a good shoe, my daughter loves to wear this shoe. I think she likes looking down and seeing the kitties peaking out from the bottom of her pants legs. This is a good sturdy shoe."
"He loves his boots - purchased for a 4 year old.  A little big on him, but I like room to grow.  Thick wool socks and these are great for Va winters.  Very high up on the calf.  Lightweight compared to the typical Bogs.  Everyone compliments him on his boots and I will buy the little brother some next year.  Hope they last a long time, but the price is great for even one season!"
Good quality for inexpensive boots.
Lightweight hemmed perfect
My favorite lightweight warm base for snowboarding and work.
"Earrings are my weakness, and I like having them on display so I can pick the right ones for any outfit without having to open drawers or look in boxes, so before purchasing this organizer, I had a soft wood board with pins to hang my earrings on, which wasn't very practical. When I saw this item, I really liked the design, and decided to get it. I've been using it for a few months now, and I'm very happy with it, it looks pretty, it's functional, and fits a lot of different styles of earrings. I had no issues with the quality, it was easy to put together, and it's quite sturdy."
Got these for work. So far they are perfect. I will update as i have them longer. Already seem to be stronger than the last pair i got from wrangler. Am definitely ordering more.
"As a big guy belts are hard to find, well belts I like. I don't like this one, I love it. Fits great takes the daily abuse of my size and looks good."
"I'm a 5'10"", 142lb woman. The fit of these is extra slim for most American companies but is perfect for me. I have broad shoulders and long arms and this fits just right. The shirt always parts below the bottom button because of my hips, but that's to be expected and isn't a problem. It isn't that noticeable."
Gr8!
This was perfect... had so much compliments!!
"It's a cool T. Kind of a weird material, stiff ish. I like it overall but I'm still looking for a softer more comfy T. Also normally a men's L is nice and big but this one is more like a M."
"Take your waist measurement, subtract  5 inches, then order accordingly. The sizing guide is misleading. If you have a 30in waist, order a 25in waist corset. Trust me. They don't do exchanges, you have to return/refund/reorder. Inconvenient, but it's fine. Nice quality, sturdy, pretty. Changed my rating from 3 to 5 stars. Great product, just order 3 sizes smaller!"
"Love the color I chose (lime green), just what I wanted.  Very comfortable, can wear them all day.  Thank you, thank you."
This is the model # of the Playtex bra I have been wearing for years.  I love how comfortable it is - no underwires cutting into my skin.  I got so frustrated going to local stores and not being able to find this bra in my size.  It was so easy to order form Amazon and get the colors I wanted in the size I wanted and the price is comparable to a sale price at a local store.
amazing / attractive / quality / shipping time /
I love the comfort of these panties. I rated 4 stars because the top band does roll down on me. Maybe I need a smaller size? Still comfortable though.
"I love this shoe...Very Comfortable!  I have  multiple pairs -  I wear one of them all of the time!  My favorite ""go to"" comfortable shoe!"
"I have trouble finding closes. I am 6 ft 300lbs. This 3X is exactly as described. Nice thick material, not cheap."
"Bright colors, very very beautiful. My daughter got so happy with her new shoes, she asked to put them on right away. I love it!"
"Item description is exact. Daily items that ladies normally carry, fit in the bag comfortably. Plus a Kindle Fire, paperback Book or iPad fit in the purse just fine. Love the versatility of carrying with just the handles or as a cross body bag. The packaging is superb! Along with paper stuffing,the zippers, tag, handles and straps are all wrapped. Placing a fragrance dryer sheet in the bag overnight absorbs the slight chemical smell. Most impressive is,the bag is packaged in a plastic Coach (emblem) bag, comes with another light weight cotton drawstring Coach (emblem) storage bag (which is large enough to store more than one purse), in addition, a white Coach (emblem) shopping bag was included. I had saved this bag in my Amazon shopping basket hoping the price would drop, it did, I am overjoyed and completely satisfied with my purchase!"
Love these boots! Very comfy and great price. Very happy with my purchase.
"LOVE THESE, FIT IS PERFECT SIZE, NO NEED TO UP OR DOWN SIZE ANYTHING. I ORDERED ANOTHER PAIR THATS HOW MUCH I LOVE THESE PANTS."
Perfect length. Well made. Perfect size.  Medium weight coat which is perfect for Houston Texas.
Very comfortable. Fits well. Long enough to tuck in. The material is soft. Adjusting straps
"42C chest 5""5"" height - this costume fit well, was plenty big and was flattering.  Combined with husband beekeeper costume and it was a big hit. Swapped out hood with a more cute and substantial headband.  This was comfortable to wear and not too hot or cold with black shirt and leggings underneath."
I love this purse it is the best one I have ever had and I would definitely buy another one.  It fit my over-sized wallet perfectly.
"Amazing product that looks great. It fit very nicely, made with good material. Don't know what else to say except that I loved the product and wish it came in more colors so I could purchase them all."
The medium fits more like a small. Material has a sheen and is very soft.
These are the only socks my husband will wear because of the padding.
I have theses in all the colors they make! They are well fitting and the soles are padded enough for aging feet!
My husbands favorite go to jeans.
"Absolutely LOVE my Withings Activite Watch! I loved it so much that I bought one for my husband too!!! What we love most about is that it is a watch, but, you can track your exercise and sleep with it through your phone! Both my teenagers want one now!!!"
"If you're on your feet a lot, you have to have Skechers. The most comfortable shoes ever! . I can rely on Skechers to give me a good fit and a quality comfortable shoe every time."
"I am always a true 8 and these fit a little snug. Not too snug that I would go up to the half size. Otherwise, for the price they are the quality I would expect or slightly better but because of the tight fit I don't think I will purchase another pair."
I love them!!Just what I expected. I waited for them to go on sale!!!
This is a beautiful ring. It looks and feels good. I am excited to wear it and will update my feedback if it does not meet my expectations.
"Simply perfect in every way: fit, looks, material... a gorgeous jacket at pretty much any price. I love this jacket."
"I ordered this set but a variety set of 4-5 different sizes was delivered. No big deal, I'm sure I can use them all anyways, I had just wanted all one size so I didn't have to hunt, but it was probably just a one-time mixup."
"Normally I give vendors 5 stars when I buy Rainbows, but this pair had a super adhesive size sticker right on the edge of the footbed and it won't come off the padding, which could have been a manufacturing deal. Otherwise, super shoe, quick and easy shipping and a good price. Thank you!!!!"
This was sooo cute on my son!  It could be used as either a Halloween outfit or even an elf costume if you ask me!
"This is my second pair, they are so comfortable, it's like walking in slippers"
"This coat is fantastic! I got it as a gift for a petite woman and it fit perfectly and with style, as it was fitted for a woman's body. Its heavier than most lab coats and very high quality. She LOVES it."
Awesome dress great fit. I ordered the large 38C and 5 6
These are nice boots. my wife enjoys the way they allow her foot to go in and then the velcro tab to close them easily.
These should be what the Crocs shoe should fit
"Came really fast! (thank you!) and I love it, I can't wait to use it. I didn't know if it would actually shade me but I tried it out and it seems to work. Everything I hope for"
The costume looked great and was comfortable for the most part. The mask bothered my son's nose so he took it off frequently during trick or treating.
"Runs a bit small, I'm a small framed woman and it is tight around my chest but the quality is very good."
"This is my second pair of these. I got the first pair at Famous Footwear. I wanted to have a back up pair because these are the most comfortable sneakers I have ever worn.

I also have a pair of the two other colors but I ordered them in my usual size and for some reason this show works better ordered a half size bigger."
Even though the straps adjusted they are long that is my only complaint it fits really well
Very nice design but larger than wife's purse so its non value added unless of course you have a large purse.  Build solid (from a man's point of view) with a number of compartments for misc.
I LOVE these pants! We are using cloth diapers so their slightly larger size is perfect. Finding pants that fit over a cloth diapered tush isn't easy. These pants are super soft and a great quality. I couldn't be happier with the price or quality. Finding organic options for clothing baby is so hard. I'm thrilled I stumbled upon these.
"Love this bag! I bought it as a book bag for my teen daughter, and it is roomy enough for all her books and binders, plus all the other stuff girls shove in their bags. The pocket on the front is perfect for her pens, pencils, and phone. It is really sturdy, and the super wide strap makes it really comfortable. She does not complain about the weight of it hurting her shoulder at all. She's pretty rough on things, but I don't have an worries that this bag will last her the whole school year."
I wasn't sure if the support bra would fit.. got it.. and it fits great. I would recommend this product. True to size.
Ordered this tie and got it within a few days. This is the second time ive done business with RTZ and they have been absolutely phenomenal. There ties are great quality. Cant wait to wear this weekend!
"Received this item and in 5 minutes I had it trimmed to the appropriate length and put together.  I was very impressed with the quality of the buckle device, I could see it lasting a lifetime.  I am looking at getting another one in a different buckle color just to add some versatility to my wardrobe.  Definite 5 star item, I would suggest trimming it longer at first and then fine tuning it to your preference."
"These shoes are wide, therefore my feet slide to the front. The bottom strap rubs my pinky toe on the left foot, but that's my toe's fault not the shoe.  All in all, I'll keep the shoes 'cause they'll come in handy sometimes."
Much better than I expected. Good quality leather considering the price.
"These are pretty little earrings. However, the look is broken up enough that they have a subtle rather than bold look. Very pretty, though."
"Originaly had a silver chain...but way to small for my 6' features, your chain allows me to wear my St. Jude Medal again. Thank you, simply perfect"
"Snapped these up in the spring as I feared they would be gone by the time cold weather returns. So close to the tartan of my mother's Scottish clan that I could NOT pass them up! Feel great, too!"
"Got it quick, just in time for the rain.  Fits perfect.  Stylish.  Keeps you comfortable and dry.  Looks good with jeans or to the office with slacks"
"I bought these for my 13 year old daughter. They are perfect! Nice quality..pretty color and shine...so far so good ; )
By the way..I would like a pair for myself!"
"Another nice tee from this brand.  Lightweight so I have only worn once/briefly since purchasing, cannot comment yet on how it stands up to washing."
These are my favorite sandals! Comfortable and sexy. Have them in almost every color.
I started hot yoga and really appreciate wearing a buff as a headband to keep sweat out of your eyes.  Buffs are fun and fashionable!
I am short but this skirt seemed long. But really cute. I'll have it hemmed and I can't wait to wear it this summer.
"Good bra for those of us who need a lot of extra support while running. I'm 5'7"", 140lbs, 34D-34DD and this bra is great for HIIT and running. I do wear another regular bra under it for some added support, but I have found that I need to do that with pretty much any sports bra."
"Bought these were my five-year-old son who wears an 11.5 shoe, he absolutely loves them! He hates socks that have the little seam in the front, he calls these his marshmallow socks and will not wear anything else! They're very cushy thick and plush"
Really like these watches. They were so cheap but don't look like it. I mean they don't look expensive either but nice none the less. Keeping time well so far... Face is nice and big so I gave the white one to my mom who is now able to actually see what time it is lol.
"I comfortably wear a 9 in Nikes and Asics. Previous Adidas I have tried in the store were a bit narrow but reviews of these said they provided good room so I ordered a 9. They fit great! I have a slightly wide foot and these feel good on my feet. I have worn them to the gym and around the office all day and they remained comfortable. Could probably use a little more cushion and not much arch support but overall pretty good on my feet. As others have noted the Red/Black does look bright Orange/Black in real life. I plan on using these for everyday use and some light hiking. The back of the heel is cut a little low to me though so I would be worried about running in these but that's just me. For what I'll be using these for it's a great shoe at a great price.

The box arrived pretty beat up but the shoes were unaffected. Not Amazon's fault."
"I normally wear an 11.5 M mens, but knowing from a years ago purchase of a Merrell boot, that they run small, I took a chance on a size 13! and man, I couldn't be happier.  I could honestly say if 12.5 was available, that size would probably be more appropriate, but 13 works for a size 11.5 normal foot.  Buy at least one size up."
They are amazing and not thin or see thru like most leggings. These are perfect for fall. Black goes with everything but they do have other colors too as well.
"my sub is rather large 44d.  and she hates underwire,  she loves these .  this is the 2nd set i have bought for her."
Shoes are good. Fit as expected. This is my 4th pair. Will stay with Asics until they screw something up
Overall I love the cap. The only tiny issue is the snap is a bit off centered which makes it sit a little weird but it's hardly noticeable. Recommend to anyone!
"I love it, exactly what I was looking for: a moderate brim (2.5""), well built but not too thick, so more all around of a hat. Could have a bit more of a pinch crown. I usually wear a 59 LG, and that is what this is-but it's a trifle big. A bit of cardboard did the trick."
I love these but cant get them any more!
Stylish watch and perfect for my 12 year old daughter just getting wearing a watch.
I wear an 9.5 ordered an 11
I really like this light weight trendy bracelet. Great buy. Looks great with my other silver jewelry.
"Love love love this purse!!! It is well made, everyone that sees it wants to steal it from me! The smaller purse also comes with a strap and is great for nights you only need a small purse...such a great value!"
So confortable and very good price. Fits as expected.
I love these shoes. No complaints. Perfect.
These fit nicely but were slightly too narrow for comfort.  I returned them for the Ride 10.
"Ordered these in a wide size for my daughter's wide foot but, to my surprise, these were too narrow.  We've purchased many Stride Rites in the past for this wide feature so this surprised me.  Otherwise,  a good summer shoe with lots of toe protection."
A must for cold weather walking jogging.
My daughter uses a purse hook and thought it was a great idea.  So I perused Amazon for one and this just caught my admiration among the 100's there are out there.  I got this for myself and I use it when I go out.  Even for my cross body purse.  Just loop the strap under the purse and support by 2 handles and then hook it.  I love it.
"WORKS GREAT
THANKS"
"The dress material is great. Very stretchy. Very soft to touch. The pattern is awesome. The dress fits well. I will note that we ordered a medium size but the tag says 3XL. When we saw this we immediately discouraged thinking that a mistake was made, but then the dress fit well either way."
"Very flattering! Nice thick material, but not too thick. Definitely does not feel cheap. I got lots of compliments while wearing it and even purchased other styles! Love the dress!"
I'm usually a size 6-8 in top or sometimes small. I didn't know how this soul run. So I ordered a medium. Fits me very good; how I hoped. Not big not small. And it shipped as stated
Bought for my husband and he really likes it
"My husband loves this robe.  It is very soft, very absorbent and adjusts to the temperature. Really nice looking."
"I was so happy when this arrived before the due date! My daughter was very excited about it. My daughter is 5, but I bought a 6 because she is tall for her age. It fits great. She loves how it looks and was super excited it had arrived.

As you can see by the pictures before you buy it looks like a mix between a Jelly fish and an octopus, but it is adorable no matter what. Very happy the size fit her. The neck of the shirt also has buttons. I guess this is nice to have but at my child's age I feel they are a bit unnecessary. Really great shirt!

I got this product at a discount in exchange for my HONEST review. I am in no way obligated to give a 5 star rating. I am in no way affiliated with this company. I gave a 5 star review because I will be buying from them again at full price because I liked the shirt."
These are great for Winter golf.  I'm 6 foot and 190lbs and the M fit perfectly.
"With wide feet converse were never an option so I had been doing my ground lifts and squats using a pair of Vibram five fingers for years.  These shoes are comfortable, support my ankles and fit great. Not cheap but well worth it to me."
"I ordered a half size bigger (9 to 9.5) like other reviews advised but they're just a smidge too big. However I'm keeping them because I like the extra toe room and I know my Podiatrist will want me to use orthotics, but honestly they have great arch support all on their own."
I bought this for a super hero community event
Very nice.  I love how they sparkle.  I also bought the sapphire and the Nov. Birthstone.  These represent my three daughters.  Very pleased.
"I love Gold Toe, mainly having a large collection of their crew and longer length socks.  I was ecstatic to find these no-show sock liners.  Love the anti-slip material placed on the inside of the heel which helps them stay up all day.  They've retained their elasticity after washing.  Furthermore, the elasticity is not so tight that it digs into my feet."
It's very comfortable but one size smaller then regular sizes.
I ordered a size up because that's what other reviewers were saying but it was still a little snug around my butt. Other than that the length material and quality of the skirt is amazing. If you have a larger butt maybe go up two sizes.
This is a nice shirt.  Nothing bad to say.  It is a T shirt.
Second pair I love the look and they not expensive
"I was looking got a wallet that was small enough to fit into a coat pocket and hold my many cards (not all credit). This is it I also like the divided currency slot so I do not mix up my $5s and $10s, etc The only reason I did not give it a 5 star is it is oiled leather and somewhat slippery. It is nice to look at which is another plus"
Great fit. comfortable for all day at work.
"A lot better quality than I was expecting. They have held up well enough for about a month, and still feel great. More snug in the middle so does not slide or bind up from walking/running.
They run a little thin so if that is not your style I would recommend something else.
Overall awesome socks, and would recommend and buy again."
"Got my attention getting two, his and hers set.  Nice length with handle. Helps in taking shoes on with out bending over, etc. Seem to be durable and lightweight."
Super comfortable and stylish.  Great with skinny jeans or leggings.  Could wear them all day.  I'm a 7 and the 6 fits perfectly.
"These dresses are THE most flattering style on any size.  The dress size chart (not the Amazon size chart) is very accurate.
The colors are so so very vivid, the photo doesnt do it justice.

Big breasted women, size up and belt that sheeiot.
Perfect with chucks, heels, or sandals!  Look at other purchasers photos for an idea of how they fit based on your  body type."
THEIR GREAT !!!
Great cleats we've used them for 3 seasons of soccer
Nice shirt with matching tie . Actually pretty decent for the price .
"I have been wanting one of the dresses from LotusTraders for over a year, so I finally broke down and bought one, and was thoroughly pleased with the quality and customer service. In communicating with the seller, I was able to not only learn I could order some of their plus sizes in regular sizes, but that they were kind enough to expedite my shipping so I could have the dress to show my boyfriend, who, by the way, loved it and immediately remarked that it was ""sexy.""

My only gripe is it is a bit shorter than depicted  in the photos, but I am 5'9"" with a 34"" inseam, The tag was marked with a size ""M,"" and fit very well on my frame, especially where I happen to be fairly busty at a 34H cup (measures 42"" across, the max for the fabric's stretch, and it was not at all tight), and I was able to cinch in the waist to just the right fit. I will definitely order from this company, again."
"My daughter's favorite BOOT! She loves them says they are super warm, cozy and the fit is perfect. She wears a size 2.5/3 and I got her the 3 and it in no way is tight quite roomy in fact. They color is very vibrant and everyone's focus is directly to the boot when she walks into a room. Compliments are routine. It pairs well with many things from leggings to straight leg jeans. A great buy. I'm a happy customer."
It's the quality you expect from Samsonite
Nice hard case for regular Glasses
we love him and a bit afraid wearing in the grocery stores yet.  a great product.  we will for a private party but we don't really don't give what people thing. but we live in the opposite party area.
"This is a beautiful watch, it is definitely small and elegant. I was under the impression that it was an echo-drive because one of the pictures showed an echo drive box. But it was still a good price and I was pleased otherwise."
"Great quality but not for short people. I'm short and this is too long for me. I gave it 5 stars because it I were 3 inches taller this would be perfect. I'm 5'1"". It is very well made, and looks exactly like the photo.
-The Wife"
"Perfect, cute & great colors. Perfect sizing too!  Would recommend!"
I love this little wallet. I get many compliments on it and it holds all my cards.
"These are just what I was hoping for! They are really pointy, so my toes do get a little smushed, and after a full workday, I do look forward to taking them off. The footbed is really cushioned, but I would not wear these for a walking tour! I'm usually an 8.5 and the 8 fit great, even with a ped. A great buy!"
"This bag is a lot bigger than appears in the picture. It is actually a real tote bag, and we got it for my sister in law for her wedding. My filled it with all kinds of stuff that would be helpful to have at the wedding, and gave it to her sister the night before.

Was a really nice gift, and made her sister smile :)"
Was happy that I could order it and it would fit so well!!!!
Good size but doesnt seem hard enough to do true damage. Hope I never have to find out though
"i love wearing this by either doubling it or tying a knot. it looks very sexy, is very weighty and a fabulous purchase."
This is a quality belt.  It is much better than most I see in department stores. I would recommend this to a friend.
I got this necklace for my daughter in law for Christmas and I think she will love it.  It is very dainty and pretty with  a good message engraved on it.
This was a fun holiday costume part.
Very comfortable and looks pretty
Look exactly like diamonds cut is the best in the business which is why swarovsky is required to engrave each zirconia jewelers are totally unable to tell the difference.
"I've been buying NB running and casual shoes for 40 years.

These are by far the best fitting and most comfortable casual shoes I have ever put on my feet!

They are light, have real ""bounce"" when I walk, and feel like a glove around my feet but not too tight.

I did not buy them to ""run"" in, but they feel more like ""running shoes"" than walking shoes or hikers. As a runner, I
can tell that these are based on a running shoe platform, but given a very ""cushy"" feel that most running shoes
do not have.

I've never actually had a ""perfect"" pair of shoes before, so this may be the first!

I just got them, so obviously I can't comment on their durability, but they appear to be made well. I give them my highest rating."
"My daugther love these. She is a fan of Frozen, she loves wearing them and the fact that they light up makes them fun to wear. They are well made in general, the only reason I am not giving them 5 stars because she has been wearing them for less than a week and the paint is already peeling off, so I guess the image of Anna and Elsa is going to fade away sooner than expected."
These shoes are exactly what I was looking for and fit perfectly with a modest heel.
"I really love this watch!!
The titanium casing is very light and looks great.
The dial color seems darker than the picture but it is absolutely beautifil.
The eco-drive is a big plus for me so i don't have to change batteries.
This is a great every day watch for me, i definitely recommend it."
"This bag is a good size to hold an ipad, travel guide book, iPod and a camera.  It is light weight and comfortable to use.  Inside the main compartment is a zippered interior pocket to keep travel documents or something you want  to keep easily accessible."
"I'll make this simple, I have this ""Dress Venom"" now as well as the Black faced-strapped ""Dress Venom"". If you gave me $25,000.00 to buy a watch, I would still buy one of the Invicta Reserve Venom's. No kidding!

This is a very well made and stunningly beautiful time piece, don't hesitate on this one!"
"Cute swimsuit! It does run small though, i weigh 280 and got a 3X but it was too small in the top, and a bit too small on the bottom. I used a black bra extender on the top and now it fits fine, and after wearing the bottoms a cohple of times theyve stretched to my size, but getting a 4X wouldve helped me out a bit. My bottoms are different than what everykne else got, others have a scrinchie stretch on the sides and mine are plain/have none. Its cute though! It makes me feel confident in wearing a 2 peice !"
First as described..
"These shoes were great, and a very good quality. I ordered the Touch Me Tie Up Slip On in the Navy blue. My 4 year old was able to just slip them on with ease. These are perfect for the summer and saves time by not having to tie the shoe everytime you want to wear them. The material is thick the and they have been put together very well. I would definitely order these again. Even though Amazon sent the wrong size,  the company itself is amazing and only send the best quality. You can't beat the price either. I will be ordering more for my son in the future.

I received this product for a discount. In exchange I have provided my honest review."
So comfortable! Always my favorite go to bra. Don't like anything else
"Good quality, happy with the purchase. Nice touch to any dress shirt"
You will love this outfit on your daughter; Absolutely beautiful!!!
I bought this for my husband for his St Christopher medallion. It's beautiful and so brilliant! Excellent Quality. I definitely recommend it and will purchase again.
"The sunglasses come with a case and a microfiber cloth. These sunglasses are really nice. The frame feels very quality and sturdy. The lenses also appear to be very good quality. They were too small for my big head, but they fit my 19 year old daughter just right. The lenses are set a little closer together than most glasses, but I think it contributes to their unique style. My daughter absolutely love them. I did received this item for free or at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. That fact has not influenced this review in any way, shape, or form."
"I've only worn these shoes once, but they are good quality shoes. They're just a little tight, but not uncomfortable. I'm hoping they will stretch a little with wear. The color is somewhat different from the picture in that the darker parts are more copper than gold or bronze, but I still like them since I wasn't trying to match them to a purse or clothes."
"I've used them for over a year now and they've held up really well.  Initially purchased for hiking/winter activities and I now use them frequently in the winter as a second pair of socks when it's super cold (-30F wind chills this year!).

Pros:
Fluffy, warm and durable - have held up great to washing and wear

Cons:
They are just a bit big but it works perfect for me as I usually wear a base sock under them for added warmth"
I like this bracelet.
My son loves his Vans!
It's like walking on squirrels.
"There's two important things about this order.

1. First time I bought and wore boxer briefs
2. I bought a few other kinds of boxer briefs with this order.

Pro: I have to say I love boxer briefs and they got a convert for life. Boxers were always riding up when I sat down and these are a godsend. The way the hold everything in place is what's great. The price tag ($10) can't be beat.

Con: The material isn't the best. I'm not talking about the quality of the cotton or the stitching, I'm talking about the choice of the material. I bought some Saxx underwear made of viscose and it lterally feels like wearing women's underwear (not that I've ever worn it....okay maybe I have but my girlfriend wanted me to try it). There's nothing like having the smoothest and softest feeling fabric down there and that's what Saxx is all about. Unfortunately, Saxx can't match the price of these Levis.

Conclusion: At this price point Levi's are in a league all their own. $10 for two pairs is hard to beat. Saxx charges double for one pair of underwear. I am knocking off a star because I only give 5 stars to the best products."
"Love it! Amazing quality, fits perfectly! I'm 5'7"" 135lbs and ordered a medium. Dress is shorter then pictured, above the knee. And the deep V isn't too deep, I got this for Vegas, but now I think I can wear it to their functions too! Would buy. Whoinshop dresses again!!"
"Perfect fit! Love the gray colors because I can go around in my sock feet and nobody notices the dirty bottoms - LOL!! I usually wear longer socks in WHITE, but decided since I can't keep the white ones sparkling white (I do a lot of sock feet days), these are PERFECT!"
"Great socks, grandkids love them."
great product as described
"Great quality, very happy with this purchase"
Pandora quality for chip price ! 
Nice that they are on the thicker. Runs large for a small.
good quality product is as described and shown
Exactly what I was looking for. Removed one star only because the way the fringe was tied the ends were bunched. I loosened the knots a little and stretched them out.
These fit well over my prescription glasses
"Are you a professional twenty-something who's been told not to wear leggings/jeggings to work but doesn't know how to wear any other type of pant? Are you into the semi-high-waisted look or want to give it a shot? Want to wear pants that work with flats OR boots? Just buy these. Really flattering and comfortable. I am generally a 4-6 and went with a 6 short (I am 5'2''); they work great with boots but may opt for a regular 6 if I want to wear flats. I also sense that wearing a 4 wouldn't be too unrealistic so, in my experience, staying true to size works--possibly err on the side of larger if you have the option. All in all these are badass pants and I've already gotten a lot of compliments at work. Which is weird, right? They're not just work pants. They are magical.

UPDATE: after wearing a few times, they have loosened a bit, so I have ordered another pair in size 4 reg. Since I am generally between a 4 and a 6 anyway, this is not critical of the pants or manufacturer, just letting you all know for sizing help! Party on, Wayne"
"I was invited to my (Jewish) friends' wedding. I decided that the dress shoes I owned were inadequate since they were $30 from a department store and I've been in Vivos and other barefoot/minimal shoes for about four years. So I bought these. And not only was I not dying on my feet like many other of the attendees, but I also was able to easily keep my feet throughout the dancing. I hope to attend other classy functions to fully utilize these shoes."
"Well, these aren't shoes. BUT it is a great wallet with the security issues addressed."
I love these pants and will be buying more in the future ..
A bit light weight.
"This Pinkie Pie coat is just about the cutest thing ever. My 4 year old is a major My Little Pony fan, so we had to get her one of these.  I have absolutely no complaints whatsoever.  It arrived quickly, fits just the way it should, and is fantastic quality. I won't lie, I kind of had some reservations with a price tag of over $20, but I'm happy I coughed it up. It was worth it. The mane and ears on the coat are extra cute. I would even wear this."
"These boat shoes fix perfectly and look great.  The came with 2 pair of shoe strings, one white and the other navy.  Love these shoes!  I will order another pair in the spring."
Good looking but to large. Had to go to a tailor to make it fit me.
"Very Comfortable, good quality in and out. Even though I have quite a few number of sneakers, I wear this more than I thought I would."
You wouldn't believe all of the compliments and people trying to guess the episodes from the quotes.  Great shirt!
Love the shoe!!!!!!!! I got a size 8 and had to get 7.5 because the 8 was so large!! I am waiting for the 7.5 to come.....
"Received my shipment very quickly, they fit perfectly & are super comfortable!  You can wear them all day with no foot pain!"
has some static but that's to be expected. the colors did seem a little duller than in the photographs but it's still a very warm blanket scarf and perfect for fall.
Very comfortable. If not perfect fit would recommend an anti slick in sole since one is smooth and slick. Causes foot to slip inside somewhat.
I purchased this glove larger than I normally would and now it is paying off.  The glove is conforming to my hands' grip.
"Cute ! Love it ! Fit as expected!  Ordered a small , 5 ft 115 pds"
really like it I only gave 4 stars because it is slightly smaller than I expected
It's a compact bag! I can fit a lot of clothes in there when I decide to use it as a weekend bag and not a gym bag. I recommend this to anyone that doesn't mind not having pockets!
"The 2X Plus size fits a size 18-20 (bra size 42G). The bodice closes all the way.  The skirt is incredibly long, so it does require hemming, but that also means you can order it without worrying that it'll end up being too short.  I appreciate this very much, because I'm 5'11"" and lots of skirts are made too short for me.  Also, you can run some vertical stitches up the skirt and gather it up to the correct length, for a piratey ruched look.  Either way, the skirt probably won't work for anyone as-is  You're going to need to sew a bit.  Personally, I like the flexibility - you can take something in or up pretty easily, but it's a lot harder to add material if a seller scrimps on the length.

The thing I like the least about this costume is the under-shirt.  Firstly, it's not a chemise, it only goes to the waist.  It's made out of a poly-cotton blend that is somewhat scratchy and uncomfortable.  On the plus side, it'll probably stay white because it's so synthetic, no stain will stick to it. If you just need a one-time costume for a party or something, the shirt is fine.  However, if you're going to be spending a lot of time in garb for medieval recreation or LARPing, you'll get itchy & you'll want a better undergarment.  The workmanship of the bodice is worth the price of the whole ensemble, in my opinion, so it's still money well-spent, even though the shirt is sort of a throw-away.

The other materials seem to have a higher cotton content, so they're more comfortable.  The skirt material is a lightweight broadcloth, so if it's at all chilly, you're going to want some kind of under-skirt.  I'd just plan to replace the included under-shirt with an actual full-length chemise, made from a softer fabric and you'll be good to go.

I recommend this outfit, especially for tall people, and I would order more of these if they made colors without fleur-de-lis. Overall, I'm quite happy with the purchase."
"Great inexpensive garment bag.  Bought this as a first time ""dance mom"" to use for my daughter's gear. Allows room easily for two costumes, and the exterior pockets are great for holding shoes an accessories.  The bag folds up to allow for ease of carrying, and is a sturdy material that seems will hold up a while."
These are fantastic.  Warm and cmfortable.  My wife and I celebrate Christmas by giving a gift to each other on each of the 12 days of Christmas and these were my partidge and pear tree gift.  I was reminded each of the next eleven days how wonderful the slippers are.  And regularly since. We are ordering another pair today to replace them when they (inevitably) wear out in a couple years because she wears them for hours each day.
Super cool but had a BAD smell had to aired out!
"I bought these for my 5 year old granddaughter as a Christmas gift. They are well made, and very cute! She wanted a ""big girl boot,"" and these filled that expectation."
"They look great, they feel great and they ARE great on those tired feet. A nice summer color to brighten any day. They are worth the every cent and will last for many years. I'm a big fan of comfort:)"
This ring is perfect. So far it's every thing I was looking for. No loss of stones this is a great Buy. I've had the ring over a month.
"It was everything it advertised. Small enough to fit in women's jean pockets, but big enough to hold a good amount of cash.  I've gotten lots of compliments on it as well!"
Very comfy on my nephews feet wore them all day
"I love these socks so much! They fit comfortably and they never slip during the day, not even once. The lace does show a little with flats, but that is to be expected and it actually looks nice because it's lace. I ordered 2 sets of these and I wear them all the time; they're pretty good quality and I have yet to experience any of them tearing/ripping. :) Definitely recommend these."
ran a little big
Granddaughter was very happy with the coat.
Nice fit looks good
"I received the ring in the mail today - 2 full days ahead of the estimated delivery date. I am extremely pleased with the product. I tried it on and it's a perfect fit. The 2mm ring is a great contrast to my 4mm engagement ring. The ring is exactly what I was looking for - beauty, elegance, and decently priced. I mean, ALL rings similar to this one in the stores are SO much more expensive! I immediately came to Amazon, knowing I'd find the same quality but better priced. Thank you Amazon for providing decently priced jewelry on your site. I can't WAIT to say ""I do"" in October!"
I love these slides!
Excellent product extremely pleased!!!!
All good. Still waiting on the shoes.
"These are granny pannies!  Perhaps you can tell from the picture, but it caught me a bit by surprise.  That being said,  they are really, really comfortable.  I won't buy them again because I'm not a huge fan of how high waisted they are, but the material is soft and you forget you have them on."
I'm so happy I purchased this shoe. I have bad feet and shoes are difficult to find. I can wear these all day plus and not even have tired feet. Will buy another pair when these wear out
"This is a roomy, study bag with comfortable straps for hand or shoulder. There are several compartments inside. I would like to have seen one or two on the outside as phone gets lost in the dark depths. There are two brass rinds on either side which is good for hanging keys. The division of compartments is not delineated very well (not truly divided), so things float about a bit. But for the money and a patient sort of gal, this is a good deal!"
"These are the most comfortable, most durable slides available anywhere. Have been wearing them for 20 years. Each pair lasts about 2-3 years with hard everyday summer use.

I wear an 11.5 and an 11 fits perfectly."
Like the fabric and how it fits.  Was a great value.  Looks perfect.
"Great socks, perfect fit."
Absolitely love my nee danscos. Supportive as well as stylish.
Bought these for my son who works as a chef and spends 12+ hour days on his feet.  He not only loved the look (found them extremely stylish) but said they felt amazing and really gripped the floor even when there was oil on it.  So happy with this purchase.
Has survived NYC winter
"Well made, just right."
"These shoes are beautiful, good material and quality."
"I have very sensitive skin that reacts negatively to many synthetic fabrics, especially in the warmer, humid months of summer. These mostly cotton bras have been a revelation in comfort. No band rashes anymore, no desperate dash for the dressing room as soon as I get home to rip the thing off.  So far I've worn these with just about every kind of top and if they peek out, they look like a camisole. I have a small bust so these have been fine, support-wise, for nearly everything I do from yoga to cycling. If you want a busty look, these won't be for you, though they are a bit better than the squashing of most sport bras. Great price, pretty colors, too.  I just ordered a second set in different colors."
"I am extremely psyched about this purse. Beautiful color, inside and out, and the outside pocket wallet is exactly what I wanted for easy organization without a lot of bulk. This is the ideal day to day purse for me, as I mainly need easy access to my wallet, id, and cards. I would love to see this design with a slightly larger interior to carry an ipad, but that does not take away from how wonderful this bag is. Can't recommend it highly enough."
"These are fantastic, fit and feel great, and I will buy more of these soon."
"Great value, good product"
"it's a cute suitcase for kids, but the wheels do not roll very well"
"My wife likes it, is is just a little small"
"I couldn't be more pleased with these boots! I have 28"" to 18.5"" calves and never had tall boots until I discovered that ""extra wide calf"" boots were a thing. I did my research, digging into reviews, product descriptions, and measuring my calves to make sure that what I bought would fit, and I am not disappointed. These slide on easily, with plenty of room for any pants, from leggings to jeans, but aren't too loose by any means. These have a slightly flared top, yet don't chafe or rub, and you could easily stash your cell phone in then comfortably. They're very comfortable compared to other inexpensive boots I've had, easy on the feet. They're lined with a fuzzy fabric and will be nice and warm and comfortable this fall and winter. I REALLY love the look, the texture, and the studs with the red zipper backing. I really couldn't be more pleased! And the Brinley all seem to be such a good deal (mine were under $45) that I'm looking forward to getting more colors. Will definitely be putting some on my xmas wishlist."
"Spin shoes are not meant to provide a good arch support so, my negative answer shouldn't take away from the quality of the shoes. I feel I got very good spin shoes. They do fit a bit smaller than expected, not by much. I use them one hour at a time for spin classes and I am still in the process of 'breaking' them but I love the quality and the look. Quite pleased with this purchase."
beautiful and loose and cool for summer days
"Made well, especially for this price! Good support, and actually gives a little bit of shape, unlike my other nursing bras. It's a little hot, though, due to the padding. It's not much padding, so not a huge deal. The only reason I did not give it four stars was because it seems to run small. I ordered a large (I'm a 36 D) and the cups were too small. I pop out on one side sometimes! I wish I'd ordered the next size up. The pink color us very pretty."
Douvle lined so not see through. Perfect stretch. Nice simple skirt.
I love this duet top.  Easy to care for and looks great on.
"These tanks are just stretchy enough for wearing as an undershirt everyday.  The built in support was just the right size for me.  I ordered 10 total camis because I liked the fit and feel of these.  I would write a five star review but the straps and hardware are very thin/weak.  One of the tightening pieces broke on the second wear, I've had that happen with more expensive Camis after more wear and it is always frustrating. Now I'm more careful pulling them on and off so that hopefully no more will fall victim to broken straps."
"These kept my hands warm during long periods of time outside in cold weather with wind and some precipitation.  The glove aspect worked well for photography where dexterity was needed.  When the exposed fingers got cold I pulled the little hood down to warm them up.  Great quality.
What also helped due to the prolonged exposure required was to have a Hot Hands chemical warmer packet too.  The combo of these Heat Holder gloves and a Hot Hands means freezing temps can be overcome during outdoor photography sessions."
"This was a great product, just as advertised and the shipping was lightning fast even though it was right before Christmas.
Thanks!"
"Cute nursing top, very convenient and discreet."
"This did exactly what I needed, smoothed out the bumps and lumps under my little black dress.  I have since began wearing it under just about everything.  The length of the legs helps prevent he dreaded chafing and the straps are adjustable and you can wear your own bra.  I love it!  It is NOT a corset, so don't expect to lose 5"", but it will definitely help smooth muffin too and back fat and create a nice silhouette in your clothes."
Its beatiful y perfect. I love it
"i love these socks they make my feet feel different as if massaging them 24-7. my feet feel invigorated as i wear them, not like any socks i've ever worn. i like them,"
"The quality was great. the stitching seem strong enough for rough handling and multiple washes. The only problem was the outer brim, even though its flexible it was hanging down in my child's face too much. So most of the time the part that covers his forehead was flipped up. Fairly satisfied with this purchase"
"I've rarely had problems with leggings except for maybe ones bought cheaply at stores. This was no exception... I bought the fleece lined royal blue leggings and so far I love them. The material is great, they're thick enough to be true leggings. I'm 5'4"" and weigh 130. The picture is pretty true to how it looks.. except I don't have the same slack at the ankle."
OK-- My family happy means I get to be happy. The 7 year old like's it.--Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!
"We LOVE this piece!  nice fabric, not cheapy at all!!"
"So I'm a women in my 30s and sometimes, you need to go old school to hold it all in. Elastic shapewear can only do so much, yall. And when I got the opportunity to purchase this at a discount in exchange for my honest review, I decided to add this cincher to my collection...

Now this is not 'steel boned' in the traditional sense that people imagine; flat, solid pieces of steel. It is *spiral* steel boned, which is lighter and more flexible and literally made up of spirals of steel. So please do some googling before buying, so you understand what you're getting. Spiral steel boning is still pretty great though, and can be an excellent way to introduce yourself to being cinched in. It's definitely a more comfortable experience.

The material is thick and I would call it similar to dive suit material? It's almost...foamy feeling? Which is great cause once this sucker is on, it is ON and not moving or slipping. That 'foamy' material keeps it right in place.

I ordered an XL, based on the size chart provided and I think it runs just a bit small. It's still wearable and I know it'll stretch a bit with more use but wooooo I had quite the experience the first time I got it on.

Speaking of that, the eye hooks are really strong. Like...really. I made this thing work *hard* for a few hours, a lot of sitting, some reclining, walking, standing, and not a single unhooking or popping was to be had.

This product boasts an underbust 'lifting' effect and I would absolutely agree. The cincher is not just a straight rectangular piece of fabric; it is curved under the bust line and provides additional support along the back, right where my *ahem* back fat gets bad.

So overall, this product is fairly exceptional for the price. I'm very impressed. Would absolutely purchase another one at full price."
"Fits well, feels as a quality product. The 4 stars are because when I walk longer distances wearing them, they are a bit less comfortable than an old pair of a different equally famous brand I was replacing. Could be a bit of extra static, so a matter of fabric. As swim trunks and around the house, perfect."
"Purchased this wallet for my husband on Fathers"" Day. He absolutely loves it. It's light as a feather and
still holds the same things he had in his hemp wallet. Very unique, and handmade in Maine."
Oh I love them! Very quick ship and fit is perfect! NO ride up or show thru! Yay!
"Perfect fit, great look, reasonable price. Happy feet."
"These were a gift for my daughter, and she loved them because we have a Corgi. Other than the Corgi appeal, there is really nothing to make these socks worth $10.00 a pr."
Over sized but very comfortable when it's very hot.
"I got these on a great bargain and honestly did not have high hopes for them.  However, they are comfy, adorable and the perfect heel size for me. I've worn these for all day without any complaints but got lots of compliments!  I'm back to get another pair in the dark gray! Can't believe they have my size a year later.  Highly recommended!"
Very good material for work. They all fit well
"My wife and I walk a lot, and I'm now on my third pair of Realflex running shoes in three years, each pair being slightly different than the last in style or material yet still conforming to the original intent, keeping intact that great, lightweight sole with those cushy traction knobs. I think I owned a pair of original Realflex running shoes when they first came out; they were great right from the get-go. That pair had an old-school look to them that I liked. I had never owned anything like them before. They were lightweight and very cushy. The second pair were exactly the same as the first, but were made from a different type of material, still great nonetheless.

This pair, the Realflex Speeds, are quite a bit different in that they look a lot more like a traditional looking running shoe. Some of the differences are: the padding in the heal area is much thicker, the tongue too is thicker, and the area where the sole meets the shoe is now a bit more conventional looking as well. The biggest difference though is the lateral stability; it's much improved. I don't feel like I'm going to turn an ankle when I walk in these, especially over uneven ground like grass or a rocky trail. I remember that feeling of instability from the first pair and it took a while to relearn balance.

Because of their much-improved lateral stability, I bumped up my rating for these to 5 stars from 4 for the others. Nothing to complain about here. Highly Recommended!!!"
Bought this as a gift for someone who likes gemstones and dragons and they loved it. It looks a little better than the pictures.
Love them & I received them in 3 days! So soft and comfy!
"Great all around flip flops.  I do order a size up to get the fit I want.  I can't stand seeing people wear flip flops with their heals right at the end.  Maybe it's just me but it drives me crazy.  I find I go through 1 pair per summer.  They go with me to the beach, on walks, and errands all throughout the day.  They Flip and Flop so what more can you ask for!"
my husband was pleased with this money clip but he was also needing a holder as well.  I wish for the price it had a card holder with it.
"They look great, but come a little big, wear some thick socks and you'll be fine."
Great boots nice and warm...had to order another pair for my sister..
"I bought two, one for my 3 year old grandson and one for my 6 year old grand daughter. The 3 year old had to sleep in it. It was a bit snug on my little 6  year old grand daughter, but she did like it."
Excellent belt. Very well made. Exceptional!!!!
a must have if you purchased keys
Definitely for us curvy girls...Fits well and is very sexy. I would recommend!
"The jacket fit me as if were custom made. The stitching is very nice. The color is a rich black. I am so very happy with my purchase.
This is a heavier fabric than the oversized dress I recently purchased from this seller. Its absolutely fabulous.
I am 68 yrs old/57/180lbs. I order xxl.
I always go by the shoulder and sleeve measurements. So far, all have worked out for me.
I did not get any competition for my review! I highly recommend this jacket."
Love this hat.  Beautiful color and quality made.
fits my son great!
good product good delivery
"This is a great quality wallet at a great price. It stays folded and isn't too bulky. The leather is soft and supple and has held up to a couple washer trips without fading or the wallet falling apart. The dye hasn't transferred to clothing or hands. All in all, I would certainly purchase this wallet again and would give it as a gift in a heartbeat."
Great quality for the price. I would recommend.
Great wallet.  Right amount of pociets
"I loved this shoe.  It was awesome.  Light and comfortable.  And best of all, they don't look like Crocs.  And they are easy to clean.  Simply amazing."
A little roomier?
"I have wide feet and sometimes have trouble getting flip flops to fit right, but these fit just fine.  The straps are a little narrower than some, so they don't look so clunky and actually make my feet look slimmer.  Very comfortable and expect them to last forever."
These pants were perfect I recently lost a few pounds and needed something to wear in a tan color and this fit the bill perfectly. The pants fit like a dream and are the perfect length. I definetly will be ordering more!
"Same as other Camper shoes which is nicely constructed and good quality.  I wear US 6-1/2M and ordered EU 37M, fits perfect!  I have Bright Orange and it's super cute to wear it in summer.  The leather is so soft as well as the sole too, like walking on air.  With its price and material, just couldn't be better.  Highly recommended."
I bought this outfit for Easter and in case I get to enter her into another beauty pageant. It's beautiful and she loves it. Plus the colors all tie in together so well.
The shoes are wonderful and just what we expected.
Nice vest. Good value. Thanks!
Very nice...Excellent Quality
"The black Camo Coll Outdoor UPF 50+ Boonie Hat has met my expectations for an inexpensive sun hat. I have worn it several times on sunny 95+ degree days and it provided effective cover for my face and neck without being uncomfortable. There are better hats available at a much higher price, but this one meets my needs at a very good price."
Amazing arch support. I may get a men's pair for my husband.
Good shoe! I like the rubber toe piece
We bought these for our kids shoes. At first I was worried because they said for adult sizes but I am glad we didn't get smaller ones. My daughter has struggled getting her shoes on and off for a few weeks. Now they are a bit looser and slide easily on and off. We had tie break so you may want to make sure you have extras.
"A little big right now.  My daughter is 5 months old and these are the first shoes I have bought for her.  So far she is still kicking them off, so hoping as her feet grow they will stay on better.  Shoes are cute and soft and what I had in mind for an infant.  I wouldn't put these on a child who is walking."
The perfect 'thiness' and very comfortable and soft. I will buy again. Much softer than the same style Fruit of The Loom undershirt.
This is a nice robe and it fits well. I am pleased with it. The color is very nice to.
Good cheap belt for casual wear with jeans. I'll probably order another. Durable so far.
It's so cute and love that it comes with a white and black ribbon my left sleeve wasn't sewn all the way but it's nothing I couldn't fix
"I used the large bag for a 4 hour plane ride to and from Punta Cana!  Can't even tell it was used, held up VERY well!  Don't be afraid to buy these!  The large bag is very roomy.  Had a slight odor upon arrival but I allowed it to sit out for a few days before my trip.  No more odor."
I love this hat!  It's lightweight and provides excellent coverage. You will not be disappointed.
"Some weird designed piercings, but cool kit I sometimes use them as a nipple piercing as well, they are comfy and a cool addition to your tongue"
"My kids have thick feet, kind of wide, but just thick! These shoes offered a large opening so their feet very easily slipped inside! They say they're comfortable and the look adorable. Love these for my boys!
I usually have to buy shoes a size up to fit the thickness of my kids feet, so you may need to order a size down if you have a similar situation!"
"This outfit looks so cute on my granddaughter, but it is pretty snug.  She really isn't in a 24 month size yet, but this 24 month is a little snug.  Glad her mom is wearing it on her now.  She won't be in it much longer."
"Very soft, comfy, hits at mid thigh. Not as thick as expected but still warm."
liked everything about the fit.  returned because the color was too much.  ordered something more discreet.
"Fun leggings, I really like them. You get what you pay for, so if you're looking for something inexpensive but cool then these are great. The material is VERY thin but also very stretchy. It's quite shiny so they have that cool faux leather look, but they can be pretty see through, expect to wear a tiny thong or nothing underneath. I'm 5'9"" and a bit ""curvy,"", not fat but bigger butt/hips/thighs, usually wear a size 12, and these fit me pretty well. They're little tight around the calves (though my calves are thicker than most) and a bit short (I have longer legs than most too), but I think they look great and so does my boyfriend. You have to lace them up and tie them BEFORE you put them on, then adjust. Can't wait to wear them out to a concert or club! Perfect for that rockstar look"
Love the fit and comfort of this bra. The only slight drawback is the material does seem to snag a little. But I don't care about that when I can get a comfortable/good fitting bra.
"My daughter loves these shoes. However, I found them for $10 less in the stores"
Got this in several colors.  Works well for all seasons.  Material stretchy enough to fit almost all sizes.
"I bought this for my 16yr old grandson who is tall and thin and usually wears an extra large in some the southpole shirts, but this one comes too large. its a great shirt at a terrific price, but order it in a large for extra large this time an enjoy that great price!"
"It is a little darker than the image shows. But very shiny and hefty. Comfortable to wear. Wear it every day and it hasn't shown any signs of scratching yet. I've had bands in other metals (gold, silver - even steel) and they all got dinged and scratched fairly quickly after putting them on."
"I have worn this belt multiple times because I love skulls and it looks good with anything I wear, tunics, dresses, jeans you name it.  Great fit"
These earrings are awesome! They are made well!
I returned these since I have to wear an arch support insert with all of my shoes despite this brand having good arch support.  I loved the style and wished I could have kept them.  I feared the next size larger would have been too large or I would have ordered those.
Everyone should wear one in public!  It's a way to refute this Administration and to tell them where to kiss!
Item arrived exactly as pictured. The bill is firm enough to hold a shape but not to stiff to work with the Velcro on the back holds and what better color?
"The Coolibar Men's Weekend Polo is a long sleeve pullover shirt with a ""polo"" style collar and a four button placket.  The collar itself is not button down and the shirt does not have a chest pocket.  The shirt is made in China from a material blend of 70% cotton, 5% spandex, and 25% ""viscose from bamboo"" (i.e., rayon made from bamboo).  The shirt is distributed under the Coolibar label.  Coolibar (www dot coolibar dot com) is headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota and the shirt that I ordered was shipped from their fulfillment center in St. Louis Park, Minnesota.  The marketing ""hook"" for the coolibar shirts is that the material blend (listed above) is impregnated with zinc oxide particles to provide UVA/UVB protection.  Coolibar has trademarked the material as ZnO SUNTECT and claims that it provides UPF 50+ sun protection, blocking out 98% of UVA/UVB radiation from the sun.  Coolibar also claims that the zinc oxide particles...""cannot be absorbed by the skin, cannot wear or wash off, and safely deflects all UV rays.""  Of course, I have no way of verifying any of that, but I can say that, so far, I have never been sunburned through a Coolibar shirt.

ZnO SUNTECT is a thin tropical weight material designed for hot weather with a wicking structure that draws perspiration away from the skin and provides some ventilation that gives a cooling feeling as you move.  The fabric has a soft silky cotton feel and is very stretchable.  The construction is good quality with seams that appear consistent without fraying.  Oh, and the end of the sleeves are fairly wide and they will fit over gardening gloves as advertised.  There are no sleeve cuffs as such. The ""cuffs"" are simply hems at the end of the sleeve.  Consequently, the sleeves can be comfortably pushed up on your arms when needed.  Of course, a short sleeve shirt always feels cooler in hot weather than a long sleeve shirt.  But long sleeves offer the best protection against sunburn and insect bites.  The care instruction tag says to wash the shirt in cold water and tumble dry low.  I washed mine in warm water and tumbled dried it on medium without any issues.  Since it is mainly made of cotton there was some shrinkage.  I would estimate that my shirt shrunk about half a size after washing, so you may want to order one size up.  Overall, I really like these light colored Coolibar shirts.  They are comfortable in hot weather.  (Conversely, they will not keep you warm in winter.)  Unfortunately, they are also very expensive.  If you aren't picky about color then you should wait and catch select colors in your size when they are on sale.  Usually, you can get a good discount that brings them down to a more reasonable price.  So, five stars if you can get it on sale."
"I LOVE these tanks - I wear them under everything, just a really nice ""base"" for layering - super comfortable :)"
The arch support may not be the greatest but the funkyness of the shoe itself makes up for it. I still find them comfortable enough to wear ALL day and every time I do wear them I get compliments on them.
I've had Gold Toe brand before. Very good socks. Soft and heel and toe won't wear out.
thay are nice.
"I like this wallet. It's stylish and holds more than I had anticipated. According to my testing, it was able to disrupt the electromagnatic signal up to about 6 inches. The RFID blocking compartment is rather small ( it's located in the middle divider of the wallet) and can hold a few credit cards. Would recommend it."
we really enjoy it :)
"I love these shoes, I brought the denim pair and had to have another pair."
Fit very well. Did a lot of walking in Germany in these on old cobble stone streets.
"Need a manly coat that will hold up the test of time. Well Carhartt is the only way to go. Arctic mean Arctic I got the coat and matching bibs and the wind and cold don't even touch me. Also great aspect is they come in Tall sizes as I am 6'7"" and work outside daily. Great product would recommend to anyone."
"I bought this as a gift as was impressed with how soft the material was, nearly like real leather.  A very cool jacket, but it definitely ran on the small side."
Comfortable but ran shaker then expected.
great quality and perfect! it is just as described and pictured... these will be perfect for my fiance on our wedding day!
"Like this wallet very much. It's slim and lightweight. It takes up very little space in my purse but holds everything I had in a larger, heavier wallet. Planning on buying a second one for a spare in a different color. Some reviews mentioned it had a odor. It did have a strongish leather smell when it first came out of the packaging but was gone in a day or two."
My song lives this and it keeps him warm
These slippers were perfect.  I have been wearing them every day since my purchase and they are standing up to my rigorous daily schedule.  After all of this wearing the heel lifts are still in great condition.  I usually wear size 7 and purchased a size 8 from the previous reviews and it fit perfectly.
"Great quality, daughter loves it!"
One of the most comfortable bras ever! I've gone completely wirefree for a year now and am loving it.
"Recipient loves them and they fit true to stated size. Great price and quick delivery. Well made too. Different kind, same price but they fell apart during first wearing!"
"I love these shirts.  Material is nice.  Stretchy.  They fit nice.  I have them in 4 different colors and just bought 2 more colors.  Love them.  I'm 5'6"" 130 lbs, D cup.  Medium fit perfect.  Perfect length shirts.  Nice and thin so can wear them in warmer weather.  They can stand lots of washing.  Stains wash out well.  Can't really go wrong.  No complaints, except the red color could be a tad deeper.  It's kind of an obnoxious bright red.  It looked better in the pic."
Delicate and lovely
"A good shirt, nothing more, nothing less."
"A gift for my granddaughter... she was very pleased, shoe fits great and was just what she wanted."
Absolutely the pinnacle of knee high water boots. I can walk through Florida swamps in the summer for 10hrs and my feet are still comfortable in these. I used them in Alaska during the spring and they work well with snow.
beautiful shoe but very large
"The sizing runs a bit small, I wear an 11 and have somewhat wide feet, but I rarely run into issues where an 11 didn't fit me well. With these, they feel fine at first but when I walk a bit I feel them cramp down on my pinky toe, and I just end up taking them off."
I wear these all the time.  Comfortable and tough.
So far so good. I had to get used to carrying this in my front or cargo pants pocket. But not a problem now.
Extremely comfy cotton long sleeve T shirt.  Love them.
Love them! They are perfect. Sit comfortably on my face and shade the sun.
These are so soft! My new favorite socks!!
"Tender is also too soft.
Is enough to tighten the laces.
The floor is thin and yo ...
but it yippeum design."
Is perfect like a real army pant
I already owned this watch from years ago but it was getting old and I was looking for a new watch and was so happy to have found it on amazon and bought it again !  I think that says enough in terms of quality
Fit as expected. Made well. Very comfortable. Great shirts.
this is very beautiful.
"Nice, classic watch and looks more expensive than the cost (on a Lightning Deal)."
These are not made for anyone with a calf muscle.
I was trying to find a dress shoe that would work for times when a stylish shoe would be too over top this is what I needed a simple classy yet stylish shoe that isn't over the top yet doesn't look like I don't know how to dress other then a work shoe
"Exactly as it looks, beautiful. Been wearing it since I got it and haven't had an infection or any discoloration."
"Very comfortable, but runs large in waist and length.  I wish I could order one size smaller."
"dad says these pj's are great, good quality, soft/comfortable. He's picky so that tells me a lot about how good these are : )"
Don't wear thick socks. Very thin. Ped like to slip in n feel comfortable
This little costume hat stayed on my head all night because it has a very secure and sturdy hairclip which attaches. Looks cute too!
"Very happy with these pants. They fit as expected, and color matched as descripted"
It's a snug fit as pictured
Great product! I liked it so much we actually ended up buying another one. It has been durable and no fading after several washes. I ordered a 4T for a tall 2 1/2 year old who normally wears 5T or 5/6 children's and it fits perfectly.
My granddaughter love this shoes
Gorgeous color and fabric. Authentic Hawaiian muumuu. Great gift for grandma on Mother's Day.
"Just what I wanted, a simple 'silver' tone cross.  I looked at the silver crosses out there but the Stainless Steel is so much more durable and the gentleman receiving this as a gift wanted to wear it all the time.  Nice sturdy chain as well."
"Just the right amount of room where needed, snug and comfy otherwise."
"Got the S/M which is still a bit big for me...though I don't have hair so that's part of it.  Simple, light, clean...just what I expected and hoped for except the size."
love these coats. I have bought 5 of them and all are still looking great after 3 years
"I've ordered belts from discount sellers in the past only to find that they are extremely sub-par. Often they have a leather-like skin glued over some other material which looses it's shape fast especially where the buckle piece and the belt hole meet. I've ordered over 10 of the discount belts and now know that I've wasted $100 as 8/10 are now in the garbage and the remaining two may be there soon :(
This Carhartt Journeyman belt however is NOT one of those. It is solid leather, one whole piece. After the 1st week, you can tell that it will stand up to daily wear. I like it so much that I've already ordered another!"
"Looks better than the photos, and fit perfectly."
"LOVE this shirt! Great buy, great quality. Very NICE vibrant color. Feels amazing!!"
One of my favorite skirts. It fits perfect and I like how it look on.
So comfortable... will buy again and more...my puppy also liked them
HUSBAND LOVED THEM FAST SHIPPING
I like this toptim baby girls headbands. I bought these for my 4 months old baby girl. It fits perfectly on her.
"I bought the gray and loved it, so I bought a purple one and noticed right away that it was not exactly the same size as the gray one. I do still love the shirt and the fabric itself is the same, which is the main reason I love these t-shirts. The bamboo material is way better than synthetics fabric, although there is a mix with 25% cotton and 5% spandex.  The material is so soft and it does not lose its shape. There has been no visible shrinkage after washing and drying a few times. If they had more colors that I liked I would get a couple more. If both shirts had been the same size, I would have given it 5 stars."
"For the price, I was expecting a crappier quality, but these socks really lasted me. I bought these months ago and I have had no wear and tear. No holes. No fading. I recommended these to two of my friends and they both love them as well. Still wear mine often."
Beautiful and truly looks like the real thing.
"The picture does not do the bracelet justice! Lovely alone or stacked with other pieces for a more dramatic effect. Dress up a pair of jeans and a t-shirt or wear it as a statement piece in the evening with a cocktail dress. I would not hesitate to recommend this to anyone, especially for the price. Everyone will ask you where you got it!"
Really like this product but the silver part has a sharp edge at the finish located it at the bottom
My 8yrs is very piggy she like something comfortable most leggings she would complain itchy but these are perfect soft nice good material she love it.
BLOUSE IS BEAUTIFUL AND SELLER REALLY NICE
Good slip ons.
"This is a wonderful cream. It isn't a miracle in a little glass bottle, but it makes my skin soft, and it feels very soothing when I apply it. It works wonders as a moisturizer. It has reduced some fine lines, and there is a slight fullness to my skin that wasn't present before. I generally have sensitive skin, but this cream caused no problems for me. If anything, it's helped clear up some problem areas. Also, a very small amount goes a very long way. When you consider how much use you get out of it (mine is going on 3 months, still over half full) the price point isn't quite as ridiculous, especially considering how good of a cream it actually is. Definitely recommended."
"I had these sandals 20 years ago when they were the ""original original"".  They are now made in Vietnam.  I will withhold judgement regarding their toughness but first impression is that they are not as tough and long-wearing as the USA-made originals.  Still, I am  happy to have them and was disappointed to see them discontinued years ago.  Thank you Teva for bringing them back!"
"Shirt came quickly! I ordered it in Olive in L and it fits great! The fabric is comfortable and the length of the shirt works well  for me. This is the third item I have purchased from patty and I am very pleased with it. I paired it with dress pants and a sweater on top for work (it is a little low cut, but I am also busty) and I got lots of compliments. I could also see wearing this with jeans to go out."
These are a great fit and comfortable!
"Pants are long, or maybe my child is short :)
Cute, warm set."
"I buy a pair of Keen Newport H2 Sandals for my son every summer.  They are the only shoes he wears for the entire summer.  He wears them on the playground - they are more comfortable and cool than seakers and socks but they are also sturdy, have a rugged sole for traction and a covered toe.  He wears them to the pool and the beach - they are waterproof and dry in an instant.  They look great with shorts and t-shirts and equally great with dressier polo shirts and kakhi pants.  They are possibly the most versatile shoe I have ever purchased.  They have been perfect for every occasion and it seems like there's nothing that he can't do in his Keens!!

P.S.  They even go into the washing machine (inside a sweater bag) when they need a little something more than a simple rinse with the garden hose to get clean.  Honestly, they look almost as good at the end of the summer as they did in the beginning.  These shoes are worth every penny!!!

P.P.S.  I loved these shoes so much that I had to buy a pair for myself too!!!"
Keeps our faces warm.
"Overall these pants are a perfect fit.  The inseam in the petite is actually petite (I am 27 inches roughly).  And even with the elastic waistband in the back, these pants stay put on my hips.  My only complaint is that the material is a little scratchy- something I only noticed at the end of a 12 hour shift (the friction of moving all day left my legs a little sensitive).  However, I think after a few more washings this will improve.  These pants will likely be replacing all of my Cherokee scub pants (which used to be my favorite, but the fit has changed and they no longer fit snuggly on my hips which means constantly hiking them up so my butt isn't visible and pants dragging on the ground)."
Simply gorgeous. Sexy design sexy look and now of course sexy owner lol.
Super stylish to work out!
I love Aravon- comfortable shoes that look professional
"SO comfortable, very good material -- I would personally not put in wash/dryer and wash by hand to keep the soft, comfy feeling it has. I am 27, 5'8'', 130lbs, fits good I ordered a small."
I do like them a lot fit great but zoom into the ankle area to make sure you like that.  I didn't notice till I got them.
MY KIDS LOVE THIS..
Ship quickly. Adorable. Very comfortable to wear.
I have absolutely no problem with this slimmer.  Does not tear when I pulled to get it up.  So it's worth every penny.  I'm a size 14 and it holds me in in the right places.
Love these hats.  I now have 3 of them in different colors.
"I received a free sample for an evaluation and honest review.

To set the stage - I don't wear watches, and it's mostly because I don't find them comfortable.  I just don't like having them on my wrist.  Watch bands tend to pull on my arm hair, especially when I'm trying to adjust position.  Overall, watch bands are not my friends.

Enter this watch.  Wow.  I love how comfortable this is!  I wore it around, adjusted it, and never once felt any discomfort at all.  It's pretty amazing (to me, anyway) to discover a watch this comfortable.  Very well done.

At over 40, I will admit that the watch face is a bit busy for me with the two bubble lenses over the alarm and chime indicators.  However, I can remember back when I was younger and absolutely loved watches with stuff all over them.  I go for simple these days, but I loved complex back then - and this watch is geared for kids.

Speaking of kids, while I found it very comfortable to wear, I'm not really the target audience.  :)  That, and I'm still a bit embarrassed even at my age to strut around the neighborhood rockin' some pink flair on my wrist - so I gave this to a friend for his six-year-old daughter.  She loves it.  She was very excited to get it, and while she's still figuring all of the features out, it was apparently a big hit.  It really is super cute in person, and the buttons are easy to push, too.

While the watch face was a little busy for me, I think that the way the color changes when you hit the ""Light"" button is one of the coolest things that I've seen on a watch in years.  I'd old enough to remember the Indigo lighting watches that were amazing compared to what we used to have, and this watch is much cooler than that, I think.

The product packaging is fairly attractive and definitely keeps the watch protected.  The watch is packed in a good amount of foam, but the metal cylinder has a clear top so that you (well, or your daughter) can see the watch face before opening up the package.  It makes for a nice gift.  The cylinder comes in a cardboard box that you'd probably want to remove if you're giving it as a gift, but I like the box because it keeps the cylinder protected in shipping.

All in all, even at the current $20 price, I definitely recommend this."
"perfect fit. very stylish & comfortable.  not sure about the review that said they were clunky - they are exactly like the photo.  this style of shoe is IT this spring - & this specific shoe does it for me!  some of the platforms with the wide straps are almost like frankenstein boots on your feet - especially if the platform is a uniform height.  this one is lower in the front, so less clunky.  the straps are wide, but they aren't too thick, & the edges are not blunt. they are very nice.  the straps are patent (not a super high gloss patent) capped off on each side in matte leather with little discreet studs.  the strap around the heel is fastened with a heavy duty velcro, but it has another stud, making it appear to be button closed - very nice touch.  the foot bed is like a pillow.  suede, padded & soooo comfortable. i have the black & really like the tan brown contrast.  the sole is arched upward in the front so that walking is a breeze.  the entire platform is matte leather.  despite being comfort shoes they are also very on trend this spring.  look in all the magazines!  these are more refined & comfortable & the price is amazing here."
"Cant go wrong with the classic fit of dickies. these did not let me down. great fit, great feel, nice look."
"I'm writing this review in an effort to clear up some issues regarding this boot. I now own five pairs of Chippewa boots (including these Choco Apaches) and every pair is first rate. Good leather, good fit, good build, tough. I own packers, and loggers and the Wellington boot, all bought on Amazon over the course of the past five or six years. I bought these Apaches this past week because I like their look better than the Wolverine 1000 Mile Evans boots I also own and which now cost $400. The Apaches are more of a ""work"" boot, though a nice-looking work boot. The Woverines have that old Up in the Holler Makin' Moonshine look as well, but they are dressier. The guy dancing at the gas pump in the movie Deliverance, would have worn the Apaches, not the 1000 Mile Evans. The Apaches have the great Vibram lug sole which insures no-slipping when you put your foot down while riding a motorcycle. The smoother Vibram sole on the Wolverines is good, but would slip before the lug sole does. The slightly larger fit works for me because I have both wide feet and a high arch. I found the boots to be comfortable out of the box. They are not ""seconds."" They come with the American flag. They are perfect. They will get worn more often than the 1000 Mile Evans boots, but I like them both for their intended purpose.

Addendum: After posting this review I pulled the laces and applied a coat of Obenauf''s. Unlike the Woverine 1000 Mile Evans boots which retained their basic color after the Obenauf's application, the chocolate brown of the Chippewa Apaches appears lost forever. The leather turned a very dark brown immediately. As the Obenauf's was absorbed the leather edged back toward its original color, but is still darker than I'd like it to be. That said, the boot still looks terrific."
I love this brand of tee shirt and own several and while continue to buy in future
"Good quality for a great price.  Fits as expected.  I ordered an XL as a size 8 which was too big.  My girlfriend, who's taller,  loved them so I gave them to her and bought myself two more."
"I always have good luck with Skechers. Only marking down due the plastic packing inside the shoe, and how they laced the shoes during manufacturing.

Be careful when pulling the plastic packaging out of shoe, mine broke and sliced my thumb."
Good quality.. lots of room. Worked well for music festival!
Friends love it
just what i want it
These are the best sandals I have ever owned.
I really like it a lot. Very classy looking watch. Indaglow is very cool.
"Soft leather, beautiful shoe, nice thin sexy heel, exactly what you should think of when purchasing a high heel. My only issue was that I purchased 1/2 a size to big since I never purchased from this designer before, but it's nothing that an insert didn't fix for the balls of my feet. I bought the Mineral Grey, and the color beautiful."
"What can I say, another Homeyee win in my book. This dress screams sassy and classy! I'm 5' 7"", 130 lbs and ordered a medium, it's a tight fit but not so tight it's not appropriate for my executive position. I received so many compliments on this dress!  My only complaint and loss of star is for the split/slit in the back, it's just too high and I have to have it altered, which is no problem when you factor in the cost of the dress."
"Bought this for my granddaughter for her 6th birthday.  Tried to find a maxi locally and they were all way too big.  I ordered size 4 because she is very petite.  It fit perfectly.  It is adorable on her and she wore it and wore it.  She can't wait to wear it to school with a little tee under neath it will be perfect.  She just loves dresses. It washed and dried nicely with no ironing and no shrinking, definitely will order some more dress from this seller."
"I enjoy pants that fit me well the first time.  Unlike some slim fit pants, the fabric is not tight on the skin."
"It's cute.  A little more red than burgundy.  The cut in the hip area is a little slim, but still fits."
"Great buy for the price, fits in my daughters backpack perfectly for school, Umbrella is lightweight yet is very durable.
A must have for any school kid who has to deal with the weather"
I give 4 stars for now because my butt is wide and from just trying it on I have to continually pull it up(you can see a little mocha(skin) in one of the pics) I'm gonna wear it out one day and if I don't have to continuously pull it up then I'll change to 5. But these are nice leggings maybe if I stretch them before putting it on it'll make a difference . All in all nice pair but depending on how it does on a full day's work I might send back. Can't have some of my butt out lol
"Bought one for each of my 3 sons for a Father's Day gift and they loved it.  They said it is comfortable and
the material is so soft."
Nice tee. Material a bit thin. I had a mastectomy and don't wear a bra so I had to wear a tank top to cover.
"I was excited to purchase these, but unfortunately had to return them. They were too small. At the time when I returned them they did not have a size up. I would still recommend them even though I didn't get to wear them."
These shoes.... ugh.  They are so cute.  And the quality is great.  And they fit awesome. And they don't come off easily.  I regret this purchase 0%!!!!! Love them.
I love this bracelet I have become a bracelet fanatic. I love that I can get this to fit by pulling on the ball but then you have to be careful which wrist you put it cause the ropes dangle. But other than that I would recommend it.
"Great look
I always receive compliments"
My boyfriend liked it so... :)
"I ordered this for my son. It is super soft, reversible, and has the perfect slouchy fit.
He is very happy with it."
"Got these as a gift for a friend obsessed with socks. They are so cute!  She loved them. I might buy me some too, and I hate wearing socks."
"They fit perfectly. Have only worn for two days, but very comfortable also. I would recommend these boots. Quality product."
Very good and the rest of the best thing ever
"I love everything about this shirt except that it fits a small. I am 5'4'' and bought a M, but one round in the dryer and it was almost a belly shirt."
"I am 5'4'' about 140-150lbs with an hourglass shape. I originally ordered the medium but after trying it on, i ended up exchanging it for the small. I'm never usually one to exchange a size SMALLER, so not only did this dress make me feel cute, it made me feel thin! It drapes in a way that is loose but still figure flattering. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Adjustable straps make it easy for me to make sure my bra is covered front and back."
"I love it. It is not too tight or too loose. Looks so cute too. I had walk with my dogs, no problem."
I got it the other day and it is lovely. I have an unusual and long name so it was delightful to be able to actually have one made with my name. I would shop there again and recommend them to anybody.
"These fit smaller than typical scrubs, but in my opinion they fit appropriately to their stated size.  I am a size 2 and weigh 120 pounds, 5'4"" tall, and the XS fits great. Love the fabric and cut."
"Love Doctor Who but don't want to wear a TARDIS and end up in a debate with a Star Trek fan about which is better?  This is the best pin, beautiful, well made and only familiar to the hardcore fans in the know."
I'm a size 12. This didn't fit in any way. Huge around the chest and waist but arms way too short. Hung on me like an ugly shapeless sack with crude pattern. Returned it immediately.
Love FitFlops...this style is somewhat large but not too large that I can't wear them.  Metallic is a great color with a bit of a purplish tone.
"I have one of these in a different color, and when it was time to take a trip with my fianc, we got another one because of how awesome they are. If you don't over-stuff it, it slides into an overhead bin with ease. The wide roller wheels are very stable when rolling through the airport. This suitcase opens like a clamshell, and each side has a zippered net to hold items in place. The wetsuit fabric around the zipper makes it easy to zip without tugging. The outside shoe compartment keeps shoes away from clothes. The handle pulls out easily and stay closed when not needed. The ID pouch doesn't display your information for nosy people to see. I highly recommend this."
Pretty and sturdy. Comfortable top to bottom
Arrived ahead of schedule and in good condition.  The size runs true.  I will definitely be ordering another pair or two.
"Listen up ladies.  Medium is perfect for sizes 6 to 8.  I would think it would be snug on a size 10, unless you like snug which I don't.  Other than that, it is great for cold weather and very comfortable."
Great price and really nice fabric!
She was most excited that it had pockets. I was also excited that it had pockets because I hate carrying her Disney wallet...
Good for the stage.
I have a hard time finding jeans and these fit really good!
"This was a good choice for my 18 month old great nephew, who was finally Christened .  He rocked the look!"
"i love fruitvogue, thinking of throwing out all my bras and replacing them with these because they fit perfectly and are comfortable."
"It seemed like it would be really comfortable, but was too large for me. Ended up returning it."
Great quality Gold Toe socks like I grew up with. Thick but not to thick and very durable.
Beautiful purse!!  Great quality and beautiful detailing. Would recommend to anyone looking for a purse for a rose tone dress.
"I have purchased two of these bags... first the blue (not navy) and now the molasses.  The leather is soft and perfect size for phone, wallet, lipstick, etc... for a date night.  My friend ordered the black and she loves it too."
So comfortable can wear all day
"Really cute, and seems to be comfortable for the little one. Quality and great price."
the best ever
"This sock are really nice, I think I need to get more because my daughters have stolen them all from me. LOL"
"Very comfortable, light weight addition to my wardrobe.  It's not sturdy, so beware of snags and stains.  I suspect it won't stand too many washings.  However, I really like the look and feel of it, and will be ordering more colors."
Cool. Can't wait to wear.
Really great very happy with this.. Made my full purple outfit complete...
"I just love this shirt it is just beautiful. It is just a very classy look and it feels wonderful on. I could wear it out on the town or just wear it to a movie, either way I will look great no matter what time of the day or night it is. IT is also very versatile I can wear it with Jeans or dress pants or even a skirt.  I received this beautiful shirt at a great discount in exchange for an honest review and unbiased opinion."
My 8 year old daughter wore this as part of her Maleficent costume. It was perfect and she was comfortable wearing it. She was very pleased!!
"My daughter used this belt for her Donald Duck outfit at Disneyland. The color is a vibrant and beautiful red, and it fit well."
"I purchased these KEEN Newport H2 sandals and they arrived quickly.  I ordered these KEEN sandals for my special needs daughter.  I love these sandals because they have a closed toe.  These sandals have a secure fit lace capture system with hook and loop adjustability over instep which you don't have to worry about tying.  At the top of the sandal it comes with a velcro strap allowing them to securely close the sandal.  The outside of the sandal comes in a quick-dry webbing material for the active kid who likes to splash in the water.  These sandals are great because they allow your feet to breath.  Also, they come with good arch support.  I order KEEN sandals all the time for my daughter.  The fit great and still give her the freedom of wearing something other than sneakers in the summer.  I do look at her feet after wearing the sandals for a few hours and then again at the end of the day and her feet look perfect!  No redness. no blistering and she does not kick off her sandals because her feet are too hot."
I love these shoes. I have purchased a few pairs of these now.
These are perfect for anyone that is average height and has big thighs but doesn't like the super wide pant cuts that almost engulf your shoes. These fit perfect around the thighs and are tapered enough to make them look normal.
"Good jeans.  Hold up very well after wearing and washing.  I am tall (6'5"") so they could be a little longer in the stride but they work."
Like a glove! And the price was great for genuine leather!
"With the belt coming with the dress, it looks nice on me."
The boots fit fine but are somewhat higher than I expected. They are stiff but will loosen up in time.
very comfortable. I can dress it up for work or with a comfortable short for the weekends.
"This sweater was larger than I expected it to be, but it is well made and looks nice."
These are amazingly comfortable. You may not look like a fashionista in them but I like to wear them in a casual setting. Or totally to and from the gym.
This is perfect shoes to walk inside of house in hardwood floor.  I also put shoe sole inside of it and make the shoes more comfortable. It's very warm and well protected for the feet.  I absolutely recommend this shoe.
Liked this well enough to order the matching necklace and earings.  It will be great fun to show them off at special occasions.
"My eight year-old daughter really likes the necklace.  It came in a nice little box.  The chain appears to be quite sturdy.

However, the colors are somewhat duller than they appear in the picture; especially the pink color of the bow looks washed out.  (If not for the colors, I would have given five stars.)"
"Works great, very sturdy, and I get compliments on it daily."
They're a little snug for regular fit.  The quality is to be expected of Izod though.  I just don't like that they fit more like slims.
"this is the second pair of this model shoe that I have bought this year,just a different color.i am not a runner but I buy these shoes for their comfort and style.i get a lot of compliments from people about my running shoes and I expect to get the same from these.i need shoes with good arch support and these are great.then add the fact that they cost less than $65.00 you can't beat it."
My husband and I were completely satisfied with this ring.  Very quick shipping!  Also had to return for different size and it was very easy.
Cute shoes and fairly comfortable for their height.  The only thing you have to be careful with is dirt.  These are satin and they get dirty easily.
Love it!!! Love it!!! I I am very happy with this handbag!!! Great purchase!!!
worm when out working
"I purchase this dress for my girls Vegas weekend trip. The material is very soft and it doesn't irate my skin at all. I am 5'3, 125 lbs and the size M fits me perfectly. I wore this dress to a dinner and the concert later that night and received tons of compliments. The only reason I didn't give 4 stars is because this dress is really really really short and it rides up so I had to constantly pull it down. Other than that, I am very happy with the dress"
"Good product,looks good & fits"
You can't beat the price for this tutu. I bought it for a 5K Color Run and it was perfect.
"Love the shoes I am a appraiser and do a lot of walking on the outside of homes, love the thick soles, the ease of getting on and off when I go in homes, and how lightweight they are plan on ordering another pair."
It's a really nice backpack and seems very durable. It is slightly large for a 5 year old but I figure she'll grow in to it. I could definitely see this bag being utilized for an adult as well. It's roomy.
"Great! 6'4"" and I can reach for the sky and not worry about my shirt coming untucked. Good stuff."
"This is not a severe shaper, I think of it more as a smoother.  It is a sort of ribbed material.  It gives back coverage that other shapers don't give."
"Bought for my husband b/c both of us were getting tired of him always burning whenever he was out in the sun for more than 15minutes.  This was comfortable, breathable & no sunburn after a 6h catamaran cruise of the Na Pali coast in July."
The perfect color and very sturdy. They are dressy enough for work but casual enough for weekends. The perfect summer sandal.
"Great flips, very comfortable and they provide correct support"
I thought I would never find this product. And when I did Iwas very happy. You cannot find this product in the store. It has all the sizes that fit my husband shirts. He is very fussy about his colars. Thanks for having them.
Great boxers!
"I adore this top.  It is just what I was looking for.  I wish I could afford to buy it in at least 2 more colors.

It is built for a thinner woman, like myself.  So, if you have armpit or arm fat, it would probably accentuate that.

But, I'm grateful to this seller for a line that is AFFORDABLE and PRETTY for slender women, because, if you aren't going Designer, it is often hard for a slender woman to find clothes.  Unfortunately, most American women are now overweight, and much of the clothing market is geared towards them.  So, THANKS Patty!"
Stud missing on both that I ordered but other than that cute.
"Exceeded expectations as these slippers are of
extremely high quality. There is a funky smell from the wool but that's only because it is high quality wool and not a cheap alternative. The wool is holding it shape much longer than I expected. Top quality that you would have to be very hard to find let alone with such a great deal. You will love these slippers!"
"For an inexpensive watch I am very happy with it. Large dial face, easy to see, second hand, comfortable band."
"Perfect size for my little girl and great quality. Love the pocket for her lunch in the front. A little more pricey then others I looked at, but definitely worth it."
Feels good on skin and seems durable
"Shoes are fine, just too small. I need the next 1/2 size."
"Surprisingly high quality for the price. The embroidered comm badge and pips are a nice touch. I plan to wear this as a really comfy Halloween costume this year. There are no pockets on the pants which while disappointing for pajamas are actually screen appropriate since uniforms in Star Trek TNG had no pockets. Pockets didn't become a thing until the DS9 Jumpsuit style uniforms. (PLEASE MAKE DS9 PJs lol)
The fabric is comfy, the fit is nice, and the look is unmistakable. A great gift for the TNG fan in your life ... or for you :)"
birthday gift for my sister. her charm fit great on it. just the right length. she loved it.
"ALL of my leo's are black, 90% cotton and Capezio! It's a no-brainer!! Good quality, wears well and reasonable price!!!"
"I lovelovelove these shoes!  I get compliments on them all the time. Plus, they are the most comfortable pair I own,  I wore them during a 15 hour day at Disneyland and my feet were in great shape.  I wear and ordered an 8.  Yes they are a bit wide in the ball of the foot, but I like it that way.  The material on them is hard to clean but it is a small price to pay.  I want all the colors now. A nice Mary Jane that would go with everything, maybe :)

Highly recommend these shoes!"
These fit like a glove and are comfortable!
It not only is adorable it kept my son warm while being flexible enough for him to play while wearing it. A lot of baby snow outfits are bulky so they get frustrated or they are cute but don't keep them warm. This was great!
It was a gift. She said she likes the bag and likes the number of pockets.
These boots are awesome! So glad I splurged on them!
My husband is thrilled with these shoes. He needed something light weight that he could slip in and out of for the airport travel. Very comfortable and the stretch material on top has a lot of give to not irritate his bunion.
These a pretty decent quality and comfortable.  They hold up well to lot of washing machine time so they won't disintegrate or have the elastic stretch out prematurely.
Nice feel to the fabric
"It is darling!!  Best of all, my grandson loves it."
Fits as expected. Nice T-shirts. I wear them for work.
"This is my second Burei watch. The first had a similar watch face, but a red-white-and-blue nylon band. I gave that watch a three-star review, largely because I thought the band felt cheap. Even so, I intend to wear that first watch on patriotic holidays because, well, what else do you do with a tricolor-band watch?

On the other hand, I intend to wear my second Burei watch on a more daily basis. I like the plain white face because it makes the time, day, and date easy to see at a  glance. The brown leather band is also nice. Having worn the watch for several days now, I can say that it keeps good time, which is a key requirement for a watch.

Lately, I've been wearing heavier watches, so going back to a lighter watch has required getting used to. Still, it looks good on my wrist and tells good time. A great watch? No. A good, serviceable, stylish watch if you favor simplicity? Absolutely! And at a good price."
"Perfect, much shoerter than a conventional NATO strap, which reduces the need to fold or tuck excess material ...I love them!! I want MORE!!"
"I really do like these. I use to have my septum pierced, but it fell out one night and I couldn't get it back in. I went to have it repierced and there was too much scar tissue to get it in the correct spot because I have so much cartilage there already. So these are great for the days when I really miss my piercing"
Very happy!! I normally wear a 9 XW and the 9 in this fit perfect!  If you have narrow feet they'll probably be too wide for you!
What really nice shorts. These shorts are true to size. These short as are also slimming as well. They have a really juice design.  These shorts are soft. Does not fade or shrink in the wash. They look good on. They look so much better then the photo.
My daughter ordered this for herself and she was absolutely beautiful in it...she was supergirl and her son was superman. they were absolutely adorable. I wish I could send you the pics of us at the party...
"The pants are so nice, good quality, have washed them twice and they come out beautiful, I turn them inside out.  They ran a little small but not bad."
"This is my 3rd LeSportsac, and I particularly like this style.  This is just darling.  These are sturdy and lightweight.  Love them."
This is a very nice shirt. We bought this shirt as a stocking stuffer for our son. The lettering is very clear and easy to read.  The shirt arrived on time and was packaged in a plastic bag so it wouldn't get wet.
Just what I was looking for. Fit well and are comfortable.
The weight and fill of this ring is wonderful.  It is just as beautiful.
Had to upgrade to a bigger bag than I was used to. Love this bag for all the handy pockets and the light weight even tho its bigger than my previous bags. Well made too.
Beautiful red color and it feels and looks great. Plenty of card slots and lots of place to slide other paperwork and money with in the snap. The frame coin purse shuts tight and the opening is very accessible.
Pretty watch. My wife is very happy
Very warm looks some what like leather high quality that I have came to expect from Legendary whitetails clothing
This item was purchased for use as I help with the refurbishing of the steam engine 1225 - the one used in the movie Polar Express.  Along with other volunteers we spend many hours working on the engine.  These overalls will keep me covered as required of all volunteers.  In addition - they arrived ahead of the scheduled time indicated.
Very Comfortable and I can wear them all day without them becoming a bother.
"Looks just like the picture, great fit, great quality and excellent price!"
love it does great holding you in
"I am a huge Skechers fan simply because their shoes are just so comfortable.  But of course, most of them are casual and/or sporty.  When I saw these, I decided to take a chance in the hopes that they'd be both comfortable and look at least not casual/sporty, if not dressy.  They were exactly what I hoped they'd be.  Would I wear these to a formal event?  No. But they can certainly be worn to go out for dinner at a nice restaurant, etc.  The upper straps have some give to them (they are neoprene) which to me is a big plus because depending on the weather, my feet typically swell a bit in the summer.  With all that said, at the time of this review, I haven't yet had a chance to wear them more than just a bit around the house to test them out, and should I find any issues with wearing them longer term, I'll update my review."
4 year old daughter loves this watch and fits her great. Band adjusts to her small wrist.
"Great shoes. I've owned several pairs, very comfortable, I use them everyday of the year as slippers and I use them outside in the summer, very very comfortable"
"Love the color. The fit was okay...a smidge too big but I'm able to get around it.
I wore these spats for a wedding and had zero issues. Surprisingly comfortable for a long duration -- I actually forgot I was wearing dress shoes."
"excellent quality good weight fabric, structurally precise, clear well-placed graphic, exactly as pictured, accurate sizing"
A lot better construction for the price that I paid. The material is very pretty and was great for the  Christmas party that I wore it to! What was really funny was another person was wearing the exact same style dress but in a different color. It's flattering for a lot of different body types.
"LOVE the shoes.  Only thing that I have to mention is that per Birkenstock's sizing chart I found that it was one size too small when i went by their measurements.  I usually wear a 36 EUR in Dansko's and a 6 to 6.5 in US.  I bought the 37 EUR as recommended for size 6US per their sizing chart, and it was quite big - was flipping off my foot if I didn't scrunch my toes to keep them from flipping off.  Traded for different size.  Very lovely color, and great style with the required (by me), arch support and nice foot comfort.  Highly recommend."
my husband loved this shirt
These shoes are socomfortable. Size up half size if you can.
"I bought this for my wife to replace a chain for another necklace that broke.

It's exactly as described. It seems durable. My wife is happy about it."
My baby is cute in this.
"I love this item. I have used it so many times. I have 2 thin terry robes and they both end up smelling kind of funky after 2 uses without washing, even when I hang them up right away... Then I got this! WOW! This is a game changer for sure. I wear it 3-5 times before washing and it never smells funky/moldy and it has held up quite well in the high heat wash & dry. I want to get these for everyone I know lol. A bridesmaid gift for sure."
It's very pretty!  I like that it's not heavy around my neck.
I've worn them once since I bought them.  I didn't realize how big the bottoms are.  Not sure I'll wear them much.
Value for money. Fine for 12 year old.
This item will fit my 2 year old and would likely fit a one year old through three year old.  This is very cute on too.
"A nice medium size bag I use for work. I really like the inside lining, it's easy clean as I sometime throw my lunch in with my work items. Only downside is I wish the strap was an inch or two longer."
NB  seems to always make good fitting and well made shoes that stand up to the hard use I put them through. I tend to be on my feet quite a bit and find NB to be the best shoes for me
Got this for my husband for Father's day and he wears it all the time!
This is the best jeans I ever owned unreal pair of jeans
perfect. like I expected. thank you very mcch.
"A GREAT GIFT FOR THE WIFE! It was a wonderful deal and for 925 Silver, its a wonderful price! Best of all it shipped super fast within 3 days during Christmas time!! IMPRESSIVE!! I definitely recommend this seller and his products."
"Love this sneakers, very comfortable, the cushion is so soft that you feel like you are bouncing. This is a slip on sneakers the lace is only a design."
"I love these bras.  I wear a 36D and these fit great.  No pinching.  Keeps shape well.  I have 6 of these in different colors.  Only issue is that most/all have lace at the top of the cup - very flattering and pretty, but if wearing a silk/light top, the texture shows through sometimes."
Gold toe socks have always done me right in the past and these are no different. The only reason I took a star off is because one pair has bad elastic and the socks won't stay up but it's only one pair out of 6...
"Nice shoe, but a little on the narrow side which is the usual nowadays.  A little long in the toes being a half size larger than normal in order to get a decent width.  Will work OK with light socks but not with heavy ones."
"Beautiful. Comfortable. Nicely sewn. It's a great corset!

I love that it's easy to put on and that the fabric is thick enough that additional boning isn't necessary! Additionally, I'm short-waisted so being able to adjust the straps is lovely!

I'm in love with this corset. Please make more patterns!"
I love this shirt. The fit is great - it is drapey but not overwhelming. Cute with leggings!
its really pretty and fits well and is well made deffinitly a good buy
There is a gift for my daughter but I know she will love it.
great when you get what you want...
"Our grandson loves his new K-Swiss fitness trainers and the green color was a great buy.  The ""5 stripe"" stitched construction provides great suppost for the foot.  Thanks!"
This top is so comfy. It made with some sort of soft stretchy material and it is amazing. I felt as if it was just a tiny bit too big. I bought my normal size (large) after reviewing the size charts. So maybe buy it just one size smaller. It's loose enough not to matter. I love this shirt.
Really cute!!! Feels great!
Boy that wears size 8 shoes fits in these perfectly. Very soft and cushy.
"These shoes are super cute and fun, but they run very small. I usually wear a 9 but after reading the reviews I was going to order a 10, but size 10 was not available on prime, so I ordered an 11 thinking better too big than too small. Thank goodness I ordered the 11, even then they are a bit narrow and the length of this 11 is comparable to a true size 9. Additionally they are quite rigid and not very comfortable, but hey they look adorable."
Love these girls panties. I love the prints that come in these multi packs as it's hard to find women's print panties these days so I figure if the girls panties fit then why shouldn't I enjoy them. They are extremely comfortable and plenty of room in a size 14 for me. Love them
Too hot for California. I never get to wear it. Perfect for colder weather. It does hold you in.
I fits perfect and feels very nice to wear.
"I was looking for the black gray white, and I love these!  Fit perfect!"
"The delivery is fast, the size is perfectly fit to my grandson feet, it's light and soft."
I bought this in a size 13 ..it's hard finding good shoes that look good and fit comfortably... After i received them and wore them I ordered another pair in gray ''
"love it, very comfy and soft!"
Very soft a little see through. But overall very nice.
Extremely comfortable & fit true to size. Love them! High quality
"My daughter wore this for a presentation at school in which she was to dress in period costume. She presented on an inventor from the Edwardian Era and this worked perfectly! I purchased the small, keep in mind my daughter is nine so I knew I would have to make an adjustment once it arrived. I was happy to discover I only needed to pull the petticoat up as if it were a halter dress and that did the trick. I took the hanger loops and made simple straps out of them so the petticoat would stay put throughout the day. The dress itself needed no adjustment. Everyone at school, teachers, administration, classmates- everyone- raved about the dress! The price was excellent, the dress is made well, and it shipped quickly and includes a garment bag. I recommend purchasing the dress if you have your eye on it- you won't be disappointed!"
Best running shoes to run in. I will be buying more. Very happy all around
Love Clarks sandals.  :)  They always fit as expected and look nice too!
"Great looking boots! Love these boots.... These are my first pair of real cowgirl boots, and my husband told me that real boots need some breaking-in. Well, he wasn't kidding when he told me I would have blisters on my feet! These boots are working boots, not fashion boots, and they fit your foot like a glove. After the initial, and sometimes painful, breaking-in period, they are perfect and beautiful! I expect them to last quite a while."
"It's a very beautiful dress and well made, but I ordered based upon the posted suggestions and it was too small.  The waist fit fine (I wear a pant size 6 ) but I'm a 36D and I couldn't zipper up the back of the dress.  I'm sure that the next size up would have been fine for me."
bought this to go with my gold watch and ear rings while this bracelet looks great  it is darker than my watch and  gold earrings which is why i didn't give it 5 stars .when coupled with jewelry that might be real gold this stands out so id say only wear it if you are wearing Just the bracelet or for sure have other gold items that match. My wrist are 8 inches and this fits quite snug just enough for me to fit the tip of my finger underneath it while wearing. I don't regret the purchase at all though.
"It fits great, the color was very red but it looks good."
Like this purse very much. Get complements on it.
Loved it! Its soft long and very good fabric
Great summer dress. So comfy!
This is a wonderful wallet and my wife loves it.
Nice and warm jacket
Super cute. Very soft and comfortable.
"Very unique the first time worn, but they fit well and perform perfectly during a workout. Wife loves them too!"
Love this dress! I am very petite and the x-small fit perfect!
"These are extremely light and oh so cushy! I would suggest ordering a half size up, as these seem to run a bit small. I normally wear an 8, but after reading reviews, I ordered an 8.5. The insoles have memory foam. I work on my feet and these are just perfect."
"This chain is shiny, smooth, and easy to clasp on and off. It's well-priced and can be used to switch pendants. I may also get a longer length for variety."
Beautiful sexy and comfortable. What more can a woman ask for. Runs true to size
"Incredibly soft, excellent product!"
"Exactly what I had hoped for, a hat with an adjustable capability to fit any head size. Love the digital camo too."
"My husband and I are trying to conceive our fourth child. I am not pregnant yet but I have already begun to wear these spandex  leggings. They are so very comfortable!  As a woman who has already gone through three previous pregnancies, I cannot stress the importance of being comfortable when you are pregnant. Until now, I have actually not owned a pair of spandex leggings. All my fellow pregnant mommy friends have raved about these things so I decided to get them a try. I already love them.

 I am 5 foot four and weighs 145 pounds and the size large fits just right, with a little room to spare for when I gain weight. You do not have to be pregnant to wear the us. I am wearing them now because I have stomach pooch and love handles that  stick out when I wear regular pants. The extra class that you pull over your stomach offers a slimming effect.  If you don't want to pull this cloth over your stomach, you can roll it down and it still looks fine.

 The fabric is Finn and stretchy but is not see-through. You don't have to worry about your underwear showing through like you do with other spandex leggings. All in all I am super impressed with these and recommend.

"Very adorable suit, I am super happy with it but after reading all other reviews I decided to order in a larger sz and SO happy I did, it's perfect.  I've actually never written a review before because I'm too busy, but I was so grateful for the other reviews or I would have ordered a small (sz. 4); however, because of the reviews, I ordered a large and it's perfect and adorable, I may buy another in a different color!"
"I bought these for my trip to Peru  for the 4d/3night Inca Trek to Machu Picchu, I will update my review once I return from my trip.  I usually wear size 8 shoes and bought these in size 8.5 based on other reviewers.  This past weekend I took a trip to CO and did a hike up the Manitou Springs Incline.  I wore thick hiking socks and they fit perfectly.  I did not feel any pressure points and my ankle felt secure especially how steep the Incline was. I did a lot of hiking last weekend and so far so good!  I am very happy with the purchased so far and these boots seemed well made and super light.

I bought these when they were on sale for $179 and Amazon Prime free shipping.

Update: 7/12/2017
I trekked the Inka Trail, I hiked up Colorado 14ers, I hiked all over the Rockies.  These boots are so comfy and provide great support that I am picking up another pair just in case they stop making them.  My feet love them!  They are holding up pretty well too even after a few years of abuse."
"Compared to other colors, this seemed to fit tight at first"
"Excellent quality, perfect fit, excedes expectations, and last but not least comfy !"
Great boot just a little narrow.
"Great skirt. Great price. A little staticky, but what can you do. Beautiful color!"
Great dress for my niece.
"I've been running in Adrenalines for years, and love them!"
I use these as a filter and they work nice for what I use them for.
My granddaughter aka princess ninja loved it!  total grandma score 
"I wore this costume for a Halloween half marathon and had so much fun. It's surprisingly comfortable and fit perfectly, though I did order a size up after reading previous reviews. Considering the low price (around $33 on sale), this costume is a fantastic value. It comes with a pink tutu and two pink ribbons that you can use to tie in your hair. I used mine to string an edelweiss pendant as a necklace.

I machine washed this on delicate in cold water and let it air dry. There was absolutely no damage that I can find and I look forward to wearing this to the local Oktoberfest next year. Once again, California Costumes offers surprisingly good quality at a low price."
"These were a gift for my brother, and he loves them!  He said they are one of the most comfortable shoes he owns.  And they are true to size."
"I love this bag, great for everyday use and great transition into date night.  Spacious and enough pockets where things don't get lost....."
Fits and supports just like the back closure JMS bras I own. Love the front closure on mornings I have stiff arthritic hands or shoulders.
Im superman
"Thick and soft non slip socks, great for elderly people with tile floors"
Fantastic!  Not too thick or heavy yet warm and soft.  We love it.
"UPDATE: Lost this one while jet skiing. Just ordered another, that's how loved this hat is.

Fits even the biggest, hairiest head :)"
Very nice and a good size - it's really visible on a necklace!
Very pretty just runs small gave to my niece
Good items - very comfy and look good too
Comfy son loves them
very comfortable work shoes
With a ring size of 15 my guy has limited choices.  This ring is awesome!  He loves it.  A little thinner than I would like but at this price??  Heck yes.
"This is the third purchase of these shoes because they are comfortable and durable, and arrive quickly. Because they are black leather, I can wear them as business casual. Im often on my feet several hours each day, and these shoes let me do my job without having sore feet every night."
"These are perfect! They sparkle more in person and are simple yet classy. I always lose my earrings so I keep buying them, I'm clumsy it's not a reflection of the earrings, I'm on my third pair and counting lol"
I bought these earrings to match a Classical 925 Sterling Silver 9.0mm White Pearl Women Pendant from Amazon and they look like a set.  They are just lovely together and I receive many compliments.  Very awesome purchase!
"Fits everything perfectly! My passport, plane tickets, debit and credit cards, and it shows my ID. It did start falling apart after a couple months, but I can still use it."
"This bra is comfortable and eliminates any bounce.  Getting it on is a little difficult as it goes over your head and also clasps in back.  Once it's on though, it's perfect."
Perfectly sized. I bought the yellow pair for my 3 month old in February. The fit her somewhat large but I'm sure they'll fit perfectly by the time summer comes. I'm not sure I see these fitting a 2 year old but definitely a cute investment for infants.
cool but small
"colors great, not heavy duty material but nice, love the graphics"
So adorable. Perfect for the little traveler.
It was a gift and he loved them.
"Comfortable, attractive, good color. I would definitely recommend"
Kind of difficult to set but it is a cool looking watch.
The material is particularly rough and I t seems to push and pinch in certain areas. I am still in the adjustment phase and I may like it more after wearing it for longer periods of time and it begins to shape to my body. It fits in the waist and hips perfectly and does not seem to move or shift as much as some of the others. I love that I have an exceptionally tiny waist in it! It cinches down more than most and the strings do not slide or readjust themselves once tied in place! The top doesn't quite give me the coverage or shape I would like in a full bust.
Omg! To cute and stylish!!!!
Hubby loves the feel and fit
"I purchased these as a gift for my friend, they're cute and fit her perfectly she loves them and hasn't taken them out since."
Very happy with flexibility in fit.
"Received ring earlier than expected, always a nice surprise.  Love the ring.  Pretty and larger than it appeared on-line."
The design of this hoodie is great real bright and cool looking but the hoodie is a slinky spandex type of material not a cotton hoodie which I had thought .its still a great buy but it's definitely a spring hoodie not a cold winter hoodie
Beautiful but delicate. Wear gently
Pinch in he back after long walk
Love these! So comfortable and really cute!!
I have always ordered Sperry's for my dad.  He loves them
"Being somewhat large is fine for me. I was being very careful about the size because of being disappointed in the past. The zipper was broken as well and the color was a mustard yellow not canary yellow like the picture. The material was perfect, so I'm going to keep the skirt and get it fixed."
Good fit and adequate flap opening.  Material feels good. Just bought another pack!
Enjoying my run in these new shoes!
I'll return them.  Already received 33 x 32 replacements and they fit nicely!
Just time for new ones!  ;)
Quick and no hassles!  I was very pleased with the service and product. And price!!!
my husband says these are the best fitting jeans ever!
Very  durable  n love
Love them! Can be worn all year round!
Once I purchased the product with the right size i loved them. They are super comfortable
"These socks were a perfect fit for my 20 month old after washing and drying, keeping in mind he's a big boy for his age. I love the knit with no pilling, and they hold their shape."
"beautiful, prone to wrinkles, but light and airy, a wind does blow it up completely, so best to wear something underneath, it is somewhat shapeless, and runs a bit largish"
"Great shoe that gets compliments.  Love the gray color.  I've gotten people asking me about my shoes in the locker room and from the other side of the bathroom stall.  I'm not a bathroom talker, so these shoes created a somewhat awkward situation for me when others start asking me where I got my shoes and if I like them while I'm doing my ""business"".  These shoes seem like much better quality than I expected for the price paid.  I'd like to get the tan pair as well."
How in the world did I ever live without a Shoe Horn? I thought they were for OLD people. Man this thing is great!.
"They are ok, a little darker than the picture showed which I didn't care for so I'll mostly work in them."
Well made. Good weight in that they are not heavy while having a substantial look.
"The heel is a little higher than I am used to, and there is not the usual Dansko platform sole. Still, I really like the shoes for knee-length skirts with tights and for slim fitting jeans. The color is a perfect blend of grayish-black, so they go with most of my outfits.
I love the way they look on and I would definitely recommend these."
"These were given out as gifts to family, and they have held up well, good quality, and family really liked them"
Such soft fabric. Color was exactly as pictured.
Good quality and beautiful dress
gift. The people liked it.
"I am tall and so I knew this could NEVER be a dress for me! However, Most shirts are just never long enough and so I was rather hoping to use this as a long shirt with some leggings (I really want to wear leggins but because of my long torso, most shirts won't hit my waist let alone be long enough to cover my rear end) This is JUST long enough to cover my rear end. I have these exact items in SHIRT format so I already knew size and that I need to wear a tank under it as it opens quite far down the front. It is snug and form fitting (as the shirts also are) If you do not like form fitting may I suggest you order up 2-3 sizes. I am 5""11, wear a size ""10"" (though some cuts and brands may be a 8 and some may be a 12-14) My tops (if a generic Tee shirt) is Med and pants are usually Med, I wear a 36 F bra. Just for size references. I do tend to like my clothes well fitting to my form but not snug"
This top is super cute! It is comfortable and flattering on. Highly recommend for maternity.
This Ring matches with the gold ring I recently bought. Looks really cool! Fits my finger perfectly! I'll be buying from this seller again. Item was received early.
This brand is the best if you have slightly wide feet. I bought their work boots for my boyfriend and they are still in great shape after a year of use which is unheard of for his work boots. So I bought him these for regular wear.
"Order way up in size!  My daughter typically wears Mediums in shirts and we ordered the XL (per their sizing chart) and it fits her like the photo (just like she wanted).  She got tons of compliments and loves the shirt.  Pretty fast shipping, got it before their promise date!"
"Let me start by saying this is a very comfortable bra. The fabric is extremely soft against the skin. I decided on the nude color because it hides well under shirts. I wear a size 34 B and the support is good for me. However, with that being said, I do not believe this bra would be good for someone with a larger breast. It doesn't offer the proper support needed. My mom suffers from extremely large breast and she could never wear this bra. She has natural 38 DDD. The straps are comfortable and the strap length adjuster is easy to use. Its made of a type of metal not flimsy plastic. The lace is cute. What I don't like about the bra is that its kinda see-through and the fact that its just two pieces of fabric sewn together to form the cup. It has no shape or padding to any degree. I live in Alaska and in the winter time I'm gonna be busting through my bra, if you know what I mean. Overall I'm pleased with my new bra and I would recommend this to someone who was a smaller to average sized breast.

Love this ring. I bought it again in a smaller size as I recently lost weight and the previous ring was too big. I wear it on my little finger and it looks very pretty along with 2 other silver rings I wear on the same hand. I get tons of compliments on it. The ring is beautifully detailed.
I have used New Balance shoes while on a weight loss journey for over the last year.  The New Balance shoes are perfect width for my custom orthodics without ordering a wide width. New Balance are the only shoes I wear now.
I love see kai run shoes. This is a good supportive shoe. I thought they ran a little small however so I returned my first pair for a bigger size.
"I was hoping this would fit the same as my collection of similar Arrow Traveler/Performance button downs.  Fits slimmer.  I so wish the fake pocket was the right chest side, rather than the left, as I tend to put more things in my left chest pocket."
the design is cool...really sooth my husband's style.
Super - the only shoe that is comfortable for my husband's broken feet!
"For your ball cap wearer, if you'd like to see them not wearing a freebie w/ advertising, this is it.  Plus it's well made, warm & water repellent.  It has a slightly distressed look, in a good way.  I am happy w/ the purchase & would buy from the seller again."
"These shoes were a gift for my mother, and she seems very happy with them."
Very nice sturdy piece with a little sparkle too . Would make a nice gift. Pendant is a good size.
Funny chit
Excellent it made my tight shoes fit so good.
These fit me perfectly and are comfy. Would highly recommend.
Bit short but lovely
It appeared to be a good quality boot but my wife has fairly short legs and the shaft of the boot was too tall. She loved the look and quality of the boot but we had to send it back.
"these are really cute.  i normally wear a 7, but i could have used a 7.5 in these.  love the bright color.  they are well-made and sturdy."
Bought these for my husband and he claims they are the most comfortable shoes he's ever worn. They are lightweight but sturdy. With proper care they will last decades. Got them on a special price using Amazon Gold Box deal of the day. Glad I am signed up for this. Nice looking shoe too!
As described. Some of the rubber falls off the bottom though.
Best deal.  Nice cool color.  Great value.  Air out for 2 days from the packaging odor.  Perfect for a short trip!
My guys shirt of choice~
"Love these boots, sized perfect! I wear and 8.5 wide and these are sized perfectly. I love them with a dress, or tights. the Brown is what I really wanted and was so impressed with how they look...the brown is so perfect. I recommoment these boots to everyone who loves this type of style..."
"As an active outdoors person there are certain essentials that you should have with you at all times and especially during the warmer months there are not enough pockets to hold it all. And let's be honest, old fashioned big fanny packs are not the most exciting thing to be wearing and due to their bulk can actually get in the way of tight spaces. This money belt is the perfect alternative. It is lightweight, has a nice elastic band that will fit most people (and I am not as small as I would like to be) and have lots of pockets to hold the essentials.

The money belt has two front pockets up front that offer ample room for phone/keys/headphones and the bigger front pocket even has a mesh holder to hold the smaller things you are carrying. Then there is a long pocket on the back that can be reached through a smaller hole that makes it ideal for the most important things like money and ID. That back pocket is unreachable if you are wearing the belt so everything inside is safer. Another really nice feature is the money belt is waterproof because sometimes you never know what the weather will bring. This is my alternative of choice now for travel and hiking at places where I do not want to carry a purse and have everything that I need.

I received this money belt complementary for my honest and unbiased review and opinion. Opinions expressed are mine and mine alone and may differ from yours."
Fits fine nice jeans
Nice shoes with heel look really cute and was stable.
perfect.  Looks lovely on my granddaughter.
made good
For the price not bad a little on the thin side but ok
"Wife loves them for the price.  They fit, don't slip, and again the price is right."
I bought this for a friends birthday at the end of this month.  The bracelet is very nice.  I've previously bought Alex and Ani and have enjoyed wearing their jewelry.  The ones I have are sliver so I guess I didn't read this was manufactured with a different type of metal.  It is still very nice and I'm excited to give this gift.
"I bought one of these through my former employer as part of my uniform, and loved it so much that I continued to wear it even after leaving the job, and just recently replaced it as I'd worn out the cuffs. I love how lightweight this is. It's perfect for adding long sleeves in a chilly office, and on in-between weather days, when you don't need a heavy jacket, sweater or sweatshirt.

The fit is attractive, definitely not loose and boxy like some cardigans and jackets. I knew it runs a bit snug, so I ordered a size up from my shirt size. The sleeves are generously long, and the body is also longish. The pockets are large enough to hold a smartphone. The material is soft and comfortable. It washes nicely and doesn't wrinkle or pill."
Repeat purchaser of Saucony Guide running shoes. Purchased my first pair a few years ago at a local athletic shoe speciality store upon the recommendation of the staff for my particular foot. Have purchased the latest version of the style each year on Amazon at a bit of a discounted price than the shoe store. Very pleased with this brand and style!
Better than most we've used
These are great socks .......
"I got a nude and a black bra several months ago (maybe 9 months??) and I am in LOVE with these bras!!! They are lightly padded (just enough so that nipples do not show through) and they are so comfortable!!! I am a 32B physical therapy student, so I needed these to be comfortable for long workdays working with patients, and they truly are. I only wear my underwire bras for date nights with the hubby now, when I want a little push up (and when I do not have to wear them all day). These do not push me up at all, and actually downplay my boobs a little, but I am okay with it because I do not want to have any cleavage showing when working with patients or when in class anyways. I will purchase these again and again, I am so thrilled with them.

This is how I wash and dry them:
I use the soft mesh ""Tide bra bag"" (which I have had for years and LOVE) and slightly twist the bra so that the cups sit on top of each other (the foam inserts are spooning each other). You should not have to turn one of the cups inside out or fold it against the way it normally sits against your boobs, which will only distort the cups over time. I hope that makes sense. You kind of rotate the cups so that they sit nicely on top of each other without distorting the foam insert. Then throw in the wash with all of your other laundry (no need for a delicate cycle when using those mesh bra bags, because they really protect the items inside). Then when I switch over my laundry to the dryer, I take out the bra and hang it on a hanger to air dry somewhere."
Omigosh...such comfortable shoes!  I am very happy with this purchase.  They fit as expected and are surprisingly lightweight.  I have been wearing them quite a bit and have not experienced any of my usual shoe-related back pain.  They are also great looking!
"Very good fit, looks very classy, the squarish heal makes it very confortable. Like it a lot :)"
"I wasn't expecting much due to the low cost but was pleasantly surprised . They cover my regular glasses as advertised. Just having cataract surgery , my eyes were very sensitive . These glasses did the job!"
simply adorable. would have been perfect with a ballerina costume for halloween but would be just as good with any cute dress
The outfit was super cute. The boot covers were a little aggravating though (they were fairly large on my daughter).
"These are so snuggle, like a cloud. Material is thicker and stretchable yet not sheer, which is a plus for me. Wear them almost all the time and they hold up great :)"
Give it to my Daughter she liked it very much.
"It's a very pretty ring, but I can't hardly make out the skulls without glasses on.  The fit is perfect."
"It's a terrific little workhorse, and I am 100% happy I bought it! So will you..when you buy yours.
They fit well and have room for a sweater, so make certain to size it and order now!"
"My favourite fit among Levi's. The sizing is spot on for this particular fit and never had any issues. Great buy, will continue buying same fit again in different colors."
"best balaclava I have ever used/owned. I find them to be a perfect fit, its soft, warm & breathable. Some moisture accumulates in the mouth area, but there is enough lining on the inside to soak it, so it doesn't get sticky or feel clammy. I also found it to dry quickly."
I bought 4 of these dresses and this one was too small - get the next size up if you get this pattern.
Just got this belt and really like the quality of the belt and the buckle! Best belt I've bought in several years or maybe ever!
Good heavy thick material. Great tights for the price but they run a bit big. I got the smallest size and my daughter is 2 they bunch up on her quiet a bit.
My husband love it. Super recommend
"My wife claims it to be exceptionally comfortable. She bought this to replace her last one because I accidentally mixed it up with the regular laundry, and put in the drier, melting the silicone clips. She absolutely loves this garter for it's comfort and shaping."
"The sparkles really shine, better than the picture!"
"Shoe fits and looks great. I have only wore them a couple of times. The sole of the shoe looks and feels pretty durable, I will have to wait and see about the sole cracking problem other reviewers have reported. All in all the shoe looks to be a very nice casual shoe, so far. I paid $45. plus tax. I am pleased with my purchase, so far."
i love the panty  very much. it is sexy and comfortable. i have an unbelievable sense to wear it! my husband loves this panty very much!
"I got this for a camping and river trip.  Very comfortable shirt and did it's job of sun protection. However, I would suggest go one size higher.  I had to return my first order.  Thanks Amazon for free returns."
My daughter loves these shoes.  She has a wide foot and it is sometimes hard to find a shoe that fits.
Most comfortable running shoe I ever owned. Just ordered a second pair. No more Nike.
My grandson loves it. Looks nice.
Nice piece of jewelry! have good size pearls and they are really black...bought for a friend for Christmas so still do not know if fits well on the ear.
fast and easy good pricing
"Purchased for my son.  Love the style and the price better than Vans higher price.
One con:  no 1/2 sizes for 12.  And thus you have a The Bears association ... 12 is too small, 13 is too big ... 12-1/2 would be just right :-)"
Great watch for kids learning to tell time.
"Not exactly stylish, but very warm...perfect for my cold office building"
"This is very cute and nice. Plenty of compartments and space enough for the cards I typically bring with me on a trip. The wallet even has a little hook you could clip a wrist strap to make it a wristlet. My ONLY complaint, and it's very minor, is that the zipper pouch portion is just slightly too small to fit my phone with the case on..if I take the case off, I can just get it in there. For reference, I have the iPhone 6s. I really like the color as well - it's hot pink but not neon and has a very nice ""faux leather"" feel. I would buy again."
"Good buy , worth every penny"
slightly cheap but..... merica
I absolutely love this bag I have two of them two different colors they have several pockets and is totally organized has a pocket in the back and several pockets in the front and they large middle section you can't go wrong with this purse I know exactly where each item is keep it there all the time nothing gets lost
The key is difficult to make stay up but the dress fit well. Overall outfit was cute.
met all expectations.
So many people stared!  Cute and comfy
"Great size for my  jewelry,nice looking wood construction."
excellent gift for a kid. love it
great product as it is very sturday and durable. flexible and will last a long time. arrived on time and very satisfied with it. thanks and keep up the great work.
"These were purchased as a ""summer"" shoe for my grandson.  So far, they have worn well and he loves the colors."
"True to size, seems durable and my son said they are confortable"
These are a nice sturdy pair of cleats. Leather is always better than plastic.
My good friend love a headband. thanks for early on may 26. I thought it will be on june.
"Haven't tried it in the water yet, but I like the fit so far.  Normally I like an XL tee shirt, and I bought Large for a tighter fit in the water."
I bought these for my mom because they don't seem to have them in the stores anymore.  She is happy as can be.  She only wears Croc's because she has swollen feet from Adema and other health issues.  They stay on and don't hurt her.  We received them fast and they were the right size and color.
"The bead was excellent quality and it arrived a promised. It is a very cute bead and I recommend it to anyone with a bead bracelet. It fit my sis in laws Zales bracelet. The only con is the packaging. It comes in a professionally made package... An although it's professional, it makes the bead look cheaper bc it's says bling jewelry all over it in bright preteen colors and no box. I was giving this as a present to a 45 year old woman, the package basically made it seem as though I got her a junk one, even though the bead was sterling silver. Other than that... It was great!"
"Fits my daughters pandora bracelet.
Not amazing but nice"
"This bracelet is so pretty, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised and happy with this purchase.  I am always hesitant to get jewelry online, because you never really know the quality until you lay eyes on it.  However, I am happy to say that this was well worth me getting!

The gems on this bracelet really shine and are eye catching.  The links on the chain are made of stainless steel, and they really shine.  Now I have never really had any reaction to any materials when I wear jewelry but it is nice to know that if I was to gift this to somebody that did have reactions to certain materials, I could rest easy that this bracelet would be perfect for them.  Stainless steel is what you want to wear if you have any allergies to materials when wearing jewelry.  The links on this bracelet are very secure and made well and I don't have any worries that they are going to break on me.  This bracelet seems as though one that is going to stand the test of time.  All in all, it is a great deal and I think I may have to purchase another one for my grand daughter.  Please know that everything that I have written about this product is how I really feel about it and you can read my reviews with confidence.  A sample of this product was provided for testing and review."
excellent as displayed
Great color.  Fits perfectly.
The color is a true true red! The flats are extremely comfortable and the arrived super fast! I will be buying many more shoes from this company!
I love the way it fits
"I'm a 36C and I ordered the largest size. It was obviously designed for a woman with little on top. The waist is fine and for the price, the style is very cute. I may alter it since I have a sewing machine but I really like it."
"Awesome watch, wear it only for Dress."
Liked these a lot and they are super cute. I am on the heavyer side and they still fit well! The bow likes to twist around a lot and be crooked though. Otherwise I am happy with this purchase!
She wears this with a heart charm I purchased and it's adorable. She's 12 so a petite neck. The length was perfect.
Great all day work shoe.
"The fit and the colors, very good product!"
"I usually wear a 1x/2x in American sizes. I ordered this in the 5x and it fits perfect. It's much longer than I expected but that's a good thing. Better quality that I was expecting, too. I plan to wear this with a corset for a pirate costume."
Love em! These shoes are cute and comfortable! Could wear them all day. Very lightweight. I have wide feet and had to order half size larger with a wide fit.
"Great boot. Sizing is Accurate however they are slightly narrow. As far as rubbing against my big toes, I just cover with bunion strip adhesive that's clear on both great/big toes. Looks like a small bandaid. Bought Earlier for same issue with peep-toe shoes. Love the heel height also. Bottom needs shoe grip...I also put on the heel to reduce rapid wear n tear. It is cheap, however they don't look cheap. Would buy again. Bought both colors in 8.5,  my usual size I would go up .5 size for real wide feet."
"fast shipping, looks and feels good.  I like it"
"My husband needs roomy but strong pants for his work.  These give him plenty of room without looking baggy and unkempt.  After a few months, they are holding up well."
Normally when purchase european military uniforms they are for the most part to small. I wear XXL and state side I don't have any sizing problems. I pleasently suprised that the shirt fit as well as it did.  In fact there is extra room for a warming layer under shirt. Thanks
These are my favorite bras hands-down!! I've bought like 3 sets! I'm in between sizes on normal bras so these take out the annoying hassle of trying to fit comfortably! Thank you!!
This is my second pair now. I lost one from my first pair. They are really nice with a very secure clasp. My only complaint is that they fade or tarnish but it takes several months if wearing everyday. For the price I think they are a good deal.
Excellent fabric!!!!! Love it
"Some of my favorite underwear, great fit, long lasting and keep me cool throughout the day."
Best undershirts I have ever had.
Great gift. Thank you.
"I got a first-gen set of Moab's almost 5 years ago, they were exceedingly tough and continuously comfortable, loved everything about them. The same can be said for these new ones, the fit and toughness of these shoes is worth twice the price."
Nice Watch for the Price. Keeps Accurate Time !!
Crazy light with good support. Very happy with the shoe. The material is a bit thinner than expected but they are a summer shoe. Will update if needed but loving them now.
Very good : )
beautiful piece of jewlery
Great for casual or dress up.  Many compliments.
"This jacket is great quality and comfortable to wear. It helped me not get sunburned at Disney. My only wish is that it was longer. I'm over 5'9"" and it fits a bit cropped on me."
Who needs Levis when these are as good if not better?
Very happy with my purchase. I own several of these belts. Super cute. Great price.
"I used to buy New Balance shoes to work in, I am a teacher and am on my feet all day; I discovered the Skechers'  brand somewhat by accident.  I find them fashionable, in a casual way and comfortable for all day wear.  The Amazon price is top notch!"
This is one of the most beautiful skirts! The colors are so vibrant. I followed the size guide and the fit is perfect! I highly recommend.
Very nice but I thought the Front nd back V necklines could have been cut lower.
"Awesome jeans! Nice and starchy, very thick jeans. Colors great and delivery was days sooner than expected. Great buy."
"Love this ! Can""t wait to wear onHalloween!"
"It gets a bit tight with 2-3 bills and 7 cards which is a little disappointing, but overall I'm happy."
Very comfortable and warm.'
I wear these when i use weights at the gym. They are OK. They tend to bunch up a bit where the knuckles are on your palm and it gets a bit uncomfortable. they are very thin which i like since it gives me a good grip when lifting.
"Obviously the price is right and I was very skeptical about how cheap it might seem, but it's very dainty and elegant. If you like simplicity then this is perfect for you. It hasn't tarnished at all, but I'm also very careful and always take off my rings before washing my hands anyways."
"Most comfortable golf shoes I have ever owned!  They fit perfectly, too!  For the first time out golfing this year, I did very well with these shoes.  They grip well."
"I purchased this hat for my 10 year old son as part of his Halloween Steampunk costume.  It was surprisingly nicer than expected for costume-quality, and fit him fairly well (it was only slightly large for him).  We dressed it up with a pair of Umbrella Factory Victorian Steampunk welding goggles; he looked terrific and was very pleased!

Given that it was almost perfectly sized for my son (who wears a size 7 1/8ths hat), it may run small for some adults."
Very comfortable and warm. Just what I was hoping for.
"My husband is very happy with these shoes.  He's had several pairs, and wears them ALL THE TIME!  Couldn't be happier with these comfortable, well-made shoes."
These were for my mom and she loved them
These flops are the best ever. The zen foam is fantastic and has helped with my heel spurs and back pain. Highly recommend them!
"Lots of clips to keep secure, I loved it never popped off like other ones I've bought"
"Haggar hit a home run with this style, fabric, and impressive quality for a pair of dress pants!"
perfect for my 5 month old baby girls little feet!! soft and just the right size..
Thin fabric. Looks beautiful on.
beautiful boa
This is a lovely shirt and I received a nice compliment when wearing it.  Beautiful color and fits perfectly.
These were the perfect bridesmaid gifts. The one size fits all fit everyone perfectly. We had one girl who was a size 2 and another who was a size 16. Everyone looked great and felt comfortable.
A very good shoe and it's hard to find closed toed sandals that are cute and comfy. This is a winner.
"Great for around the house, kept me from wearing the bottoms of my socks out, :)"
Fourth pair of these shoes I have bought extremely comfortable and look good with almost any kind of outfit.
Sooo cute!
Price was great for a four pack.  Fit well.
"I'm leaving a good review for this because it is exactly as described, and it was my fault that I listened to the other reviews on here about this product. It is NOT for adult shirts, it is indeed as it says and is made for YOUTH and CHILD shirts. So make sure you understand exactly what you're ordering!"
"Very cute perfect addition to any clown costume! We added blood spatter to give a creepy effect for a scary clown costume. They would be just fine on their own though. They are thin, and will most likely tear if worn outdoors. Good size with room for even the biggest feet. Will be tough to wear over tennis shoes as the opening isn't wide enough for a teen/adult shoe. Can add newspaper inside to help fill it out. Would buy again"
"This line of pants is wonderful. They fit perfectly and look great while holding it's shape. The is inexpensive enough so that as my husband continues to lose weight I can by a new pant wardrobe for him as needed, which is once or twice a year.  He's started as a 44 waist and is now a 36"
Great looking and great price
"Bought 2 in 1 order and each one was a different brand/material. This dark gray was medium thickness and a tad small. Ordered red as well, very thick and fit accordingly."
"I love this bag! It's cute, holds just the right amount of items and has nice deep pockets to hold loose items. I have two toddlers and wanted a bag that I don't have to carry while I'm out with them. It holds their wipes, snacks, change of underwear, my wallet, lip gloss and cellphone very well. ."
perfect size great quality better than i expect it!
I originally bought these in chocolate brown in my reg. size. Unfortunately they were too small and out of stock. So I ordered up a size in this color. They fit a little better but the sizing is way off. I guess I should have sized up 2 sizes bigger!
"My husband loves these shoes. They fit him really well, which is difficult to find in his size."
Bought them for my wife to go with her Cape Cod 14k Unique Royal Jewelry bracelet. She loves them.
I gave this to my sister. She says it is light on her wrist and she can forget she is wearing it. She also likes the readable letters.
"Fits great, I love the line of it. I've gotten many compliments on this top."
I love this romper! The cutest thing ever!
Fits great and of great material
"These fit exactly as I expected, and with prime, they were on my door in no time! I will definitely"
"Our 6 1/2 month old weighs about 22 lbs, and is a little over 2 feet tall. Not fat by any means - she is about the size of a 12 month old. We ordered in size 12 months, and the height is great - but its very very slim cute. It would have been nice if the description mentioned that... very sweet pattern, and she is comfortable in it. I washed in cold, and dried on normal heat (we use 'medium' heat) and they did not shrink."
My daughter wears this almost once a week!
Good value. Nice material
"Too big in chest area. Great buy, nice material, otherwise."
Having wide feet they fit perfectly!
These feel great on my cold legs. They shine more like a disco party than I thought they would. Not like Donna Summer disco but more like Saturday Night Fever. They fit great for being one size fits all humans. I'd buy more.
The quality of this skirt was much better than the other one I ordered from another company. the fit was also better. I will be ordering more in other colors.
"Best fit, nice lay flat collar, stays tucked in.  Best T shirts purchased."
This top is awesome! It has a very flattering fit almost to the point of slimming. It feels good against the skin too. The material fits just right around the neck. Can easily be worn alone as I plan to do but also works well as a layering piece. I got it in the mocha color. Nice. Now I will order it in black and white.
"Nice boardshorts. Definitely go 1-2 sizes higher than you expect.
I am 6'1"" and 300 lbs (mostly stomach), normally 44-46 waist in pants and the 5X plus in these shorts fit comfortably.
No issue with inner lining."
"If you're a real tree girl, you'll like this T. Soft cotton & easy fit for a nice price, I bought it to go with my real tree shoes.
It hugs in all the right places & launders well."
"Another pretty and super soft t-shirt! This one is a little more fitted than some of the others I have received from this brand, but I still love it! The color is fantastic, and the fabric is oh-so super soft. The lace is the perfect little pretty detail. Perfect! I received this item at a discount in exchange for my open and honest review."
Love this shirt. I have three others in different colors. I like the not too fitted design but just enough to look neat and not boxy.
A little big but can wear w thick socks
"Beautiful bag, very pleased with quality and the size is excellent"
"Comfortable for all day, on your feet!"
"I truly love these socks.
Most comfortable ones I have ever worn."
"I ordered a large, I wear 36DD bra.. the large was a little too big. Next time I will be ordering a medium."
Solid brush that'll help you save a few bucks shining your own shoes. It sheds a bit but nothing close to too much. Perfect size to sweep the toe and heel - the two places you'll need it most. Can't go wrong. I'm buying another to keep the black and brown polish separate.
It is awesome. It is now one of the my favorite one.
"Great belt.  I'm a bigger guy, with too much gut, and single clasp belts tend to fold and get out of shape very quickly.  This one with two (clasps?) works awesome and does not lose its shape quickly.  I've just purchased my second (cause I lost some weight!), and I will buy a third.  Great with jeans, or shorts.  Not a dress belt, but I dint have to wear a suit any more!!!"
"I love my new Teva hiking shoes.  They are comfortable and well made.  The tread on the soles is deep, great for walking on the snow."
Really really good shoes my new favorites for a long walk days
It was not as soft as I had hoped but not uncomfortable either.  Design is very simple so if you are looking for something sexy this is not for you. I personally look for comfort in nightgowns.  I bought this after surgery knowing that I would be spending more time laying around.
"Really nice product. They are not thick though, but should be perfect for a autumn day."
"This is a great shoe and very comfortable for walking.  You won't regret buying this tennis shoe and, best of all, your FEET will love it!"
"I am so glad I purchased this sandal.  The size was perfect for me. I was a bit concerned about the strap that goes across the toes, but there was no binding or rubbing in the wrong place.  The gold color was perfect.  I really love this shoe."
LOOOVe this bra.  The one I purchased at Dillards about two years ago is in excellent shape.  Holds and supports.
"These are fabulous. Ordered one size bigger than I usually wear to account for the fact that I am in my thirties and not a ""junior"" anymore. I didn't care for the rhinestones on one pocket and some belt loops but they peeled off easily. Will definitely buy these again."
"Love this boot. Runs true to size. I wear with dresses and jeans and get compliments every time. They are super comfy and western, without being too western."
All in all I like them.
"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE.  Finally a comfortable and good looking product."
My son LOVES this shoe and the color!
"I ussually used 10,5 and the fits is perfect. Also the boots looks prety with pants or leggins!
The leather is very soft, I love Nine West boot."
"large enough to see, small enough to not be showy.  very pretty, looks expensive. bought the silver for my granddaughter, the gold setting for me"
One of my favorite shoes. So comfortable. Can wear to work in the office on a casual Friday.
"They fit perfectly, which is no easy feat for jeans"
Loving this slip.
"I researched a few sites recommending what size I should get. I'm almost always a shoe size 8. But I found that the corresponding size 39 was too big. I then ordered a 38 and it seems to be just right, just need to return the 39's. I haven't worn them much yet but they seem pretty comfortable for teaching on my feet all day. And they look great."
"Nice thickness to the socks, good quality."
"This is my first pair Dansko's. I found them while shopping for black leather clogs on Amazon. They seemed like a modern day version of the style without the trappings of being unsafe, uncomfortable, or ridiculous looking. Sold. On size: I am a solid 7.5 and initially I ordered the 38 but it ended up being too big. When I walked they literally fell away from my heels so I was walking on them like they were flip flops. But damn they were so comfy! So went down a size to 37.
I've never received, tried on, and returned shoes so fast in my life -- less than 30m! In that time the shoes went from $73 to $100 -- AND I STILL BOUGHT THEM! I was/am furious but now that I have the right size I have no regrets. They fit perfect! I wear them without socks. They still have plenty of room around the Achiles' tendon but hug the heel and the toe box is nice and roomy. I love them."
This lil shoe is cute size 7 is larger than expected first issue ever.  Had to use heel cushions as a filler.
"re ordered a size up, cute though."
Cute for a costume. Nice fit. Good price point.
Great quality and color (we got the pink). I was able to fit a week's+ worth of winter clothing for BOTH my 1-yr-old and 4-yr-old (not including shoes) in this suitcase. Rolls beautifully and my 4-year-old was able to roll it through the airport and on/off the plane with ease.
Color Andy fit as expected.
"I purchased these earrings to accompany the matching necklace.  As with the necklace, the earrings are of good quality and weight."
These are excellent.  They fit perfect and are really soft and comfortable.
Hubby loved them
"I am thrilled with these boots. They fit great; roomy enough in the foot area and snug in the calf. I am 5'7 with an average calf size and I had no problem zipping them up over skinny jeans. The leather is beautiful, a bit stiff but will soften with wear and has a lovely finish. I recommend these wholeheartedly."
This is a beauty!!! Fits nicely.
"Loved the fit and make of this dress.  Very flattering dress.  Daughter is 5'8"" and it hits her right below the knees.  She liked it because it flowed nicely."
Loved the wig it fit my 5 year old great. Honestly it's better them most at the store.
"I bought this for my sister and she absolutely loves it!  We went on a trip and didn't want to check our baggage, and this was the solution to our dilemma."
Amazing amazing amazing!! I love them exactly as shown in picture!
"Have not gotten cold enough to wear, once it does I'll update."
It's been almost a year since I purchased these and they have not faded...no wear and tear at all. And I promise I wear 1 or the other each and everyday.
"i love nine west junia.  the heel is perfect:  perfect height and shape, the styling is very flattering, and it's an all-day wear boot. i have scoured the internet for more colors, but have only been able to find three.  the leopard of last year should be reintroduced this year.  navy and gray would be great.best go-to boot for me, and i have many pair of boots in my closet.  please make again!"
Very comfy. Use them for kayaking. I get a lot of comments
"Love the look, but the sweater seemed a bit too wide. Good sleeve lengths though."
"It's a light fabric *what I wanted, fit perfectly, and looks good on me. It had a strange smell (chemical) when I got I got it, but one wash took care of that. Wear it with a slip - perfect for casual beach vacation."
These are white undershirts. Nothing to write home about. So far they have kept their white pretty well and don't seem to shrink.
"This Timex is very nice.  It has a very clear, easy to read face.  The black leather strap feels very comfortable on.  My only complaint is the face seems heavy as it keeps moving to the side of my arm. I tried to tighten the strap but then it is too tight for my wrist.

I do really like this watch and will be wearing it this fall and winter."
I was nervous ordering these because of some of the reviews.  But the high back heel is fantastic for keeping the shoes on when you walk.  They are very comfortable.  I'll be ordering in other colors.
It fits very nice.  I love it
This item is adoreable! I was pleased. It did look smaller than most three month old items. I would order a size up for safe measure. Will order from the seller again in the future!!
best running shoe i have ever had.  I love the nimbus line from asics
"Fits perfectly and I am a large 5'10"" so was very pleased"
"I have a $100 Tumi wallet that I have replaced with this beauty here. I hate having large things in my pocket, and this holds everything I need. Perfect for jogging, biking, or walking around."
"A minor size adjustment, and that fit perfectly."
color and very nice quality and fast delivery
Great! My old one died that was identical. This was cheaper than getting the old one repaired.
These fit well however I gave only 4 stars due to the PU lining on part that goes over foot sticks to skin and causes rubbing that irritates my toes.
"Excellent product, adjusted very well to what I needed , I hope soon use!"
"I have a brown pair of these sandals and they fit like a true 8-1/2.  This black pair however, fits like an 8-3/4!  But the fit is good enough to keep them.  They are comfy - the only sandal that I can shop in!!"
"Very nice coat. I bought it for my son. Fits perfect.  2 of the buttons weren't sewn on very well, but I just put a few stitches in myself to tighten them up."
"Absolutely beautiful, I love them."
"I love this robe. It's perfect for slipping on right after a bath. Not too thin, and nice and fluffy and soft. I wanted a true absorbent bathrobe instead of those lounge robes, and this was perfect, for a great price to boot!"
Beautiful boots. Love them!
"I absolutely love this !!  Just enough coverage and longer than usual, true tunic.  Thank you."
"I brought for my 3 month old baby boy.... big even if adjusted, but he has a baby (newborn) neck... but this bowtie is soooo darn cute. He seems a little cheap, like it's going to break, so you're naturally a little cautious with it... but it's actually pretty sturdy."
Does what it is supposed to do. Easy to set the combo.
"I usually wear a size US 0-2, so I ordered a size up (Small) as was suggested, and the top fits fine but the bottoms are a bit tight in the hips, (my hips are 36in) so I should have gotten an M for the bottom and S for the top."
"This stuff is awesome, stays on my face all day during a day at the ocean. Mostly clear, sometimes there's a slight white-ish cast if you don't rub it in at all. But I usually do (you only have to do it the littlest bit) and then it's perfect! Thanks.

By the way, the tube might look like it's deodorant sized in the pics, but it's really a little bit longer than a tube of lipstick. Just fyi! That much has lasted me the whole summer."
"A little snug, but surprisingly comfortable to wear.  The length touches my knee, so being an older woman, I was hoping to let down the hem an inch, but there isn't an inch of material in the hem.  For the price paid, I'm tempted to order a larger size and use this one to add some length to the newer one, but I worry about color-dye matching.  The Red Hat Ladies would love the deep purple color of this one!  Clothng made in China does seem to run smaller than standard U.S. women's sizes."
"Good fit, love the designs! All except for the orange random numbers one."
"We are very happy with the watch, it is super cute and elegant"
Runs small for thinner people! Gave to sister.
Wow fits perfectly into my medium sized tote. Its planned out well and the pockets work out perfectly. Arrived on time as expected.
"My husband needed a new wedding ring after 'misplacing' his original one. We had bought another Tungsten ring and were impressed with it but it was a bit too bulky for my husbands hand and had to send it back. We decided on this one because of the smaller size, and my husband really likes it. It's a bit darker than what the photo lets on...like a slightly darker grey color, rather than the silver tone, but it looks very nice. Seems to be very durable as well...my husband visits the gym for weight lifting quite often and no scratches yet!! Beautiful piece of jewelry, great quality and scratch resistant. Great buy as well!!"
Recipient was very happy with it.
"Great for the price.  This was a gift to my husband.  He loves it.  It can hold up to 20 of the oversized watches, it does not look cheap, it has the glass top, and it also locks and unlocks with a key."
Perfect fit the original Pebble Smartwatch.  It looks good too.
These thigh high stockings do just the trick for the colder winter!  I wear them with boots under slacks or jeans and I am good to go!  They do stay put so I am pleased with them overall.
"These are what I wanted and expected.  I can wear anywhere from a 9 to a 10 so I chose to go with a 10 and they're very comfy.  I would have liked a tan but they were out, I'll have to try again.  I'll probably order another pair."
This is a heavy duty top/pullover that I wore in cold weather with a thermal top underneath.  Comfortable and ruggedly stylish.
"I'm no small guy and this costume fit just fine.  someone complained about the quality, but I found it to be just as expected. I didn't need the wig though ;)"
Very cute and flattering. Not clingy or awkward looking.
"I love this watch. The blue & white are striking. The case is a little smaller than most G Shocks, but still good & super comfortable."
A great looking watch.... A big face on the watch and really pops onthe wrist. It came nicely packaged. I liked the fact that they set the watch before sending to me.
"I normally need a wide shoe but these fit better than many of my ""wide width"" shoes.  Also have a high arch but no problem at all getting them on and off.  LOVE these!"
Perfect for my baby girl!
"This travel  umbrella  came in handy yesterday  and  today. It has been cold and rainy and windy and this  umbrella  withstood  it all. It's easy to open and close. It covered me really well, my  hair  and  clothing  remained dry. It's black so it's not a tacky eye sore  but classy and professional  looking. I really  like it and would  recommend  it. I received  a  free  sample  of  this  product  in  exchange  for  an  honest  review."
So incredibly cute this product fit my one year old 2 year old and 7 year old
"They're very snug, but I like that. Very cute, material is soft and a little thin. Great for any casual outfits. I wore these leggings with a pumpkin sweater to a Halloween party and got many compliments. After Halloween I wore them with an off-white sweater and they looked great for fall!"
This has become my new favorite piece of jewrly.  The scripture verse is so important and the smart visual reminder is helpful and beautiful.  I have had many conversations about the Gospel started while wearing this piece so for me it is doing what I had hoped.  Love it!
These shoes are well made and very cushy for my toddler. We bought 2 sizes larger so she can grow into them- feels like maybe only one size larger. They run a little small.
Perfect size 2... Came exactly as expected.  My daughter loves them.
"Having bought 3 different brands of Merino wool underwear, I can happily say that Icebreaker is the best value for your money. If you're willing to shell out another 8 bucks, grab yourself a pair of Wool&Prince underwear for a slightly better product.

But really, these are great. They don't FEEL like wool, which is a good thing. They handle odor and moisture very well."
Finally got the right size and color. The belt is great and my husband seems to like it.
This is such a darling knit blessing outfit.  It fit my little dude perfectly.  And it even came with a nice knit matching hanger  :)  We got a lot of compliments on it.
Feel great. Love the decorations!
"My wife has not used this on her ""bust and belly"" because she has flawless skin and has remained impervious to the affects of pregnancy...

We have been using this for the kids' skin.  The lotions are really great and absorb quickly.  The scent is also very pleasant.  Similar to other Mustela products, it's light and clean."
suit is fine
Nice bag but next time I'd get the medium. This is for really basic stuff only. When you have the shoes in the breathing pouch (nice feature) it takes up half the room inside the bag itself.
These are exactly what I was looking for. Mid calf socks that are not binding. They feel great from a nurse that works 12 hour shifts. Ordering again for sure!!
"The cloth part Fits tight to begin with, but stiches to normal fit within an hour of wearing. These are great!"
"This watch cannot be beat for the price and the quality.  Seiko comes through again.  No one makes a better watch in this category for under 300.00 bucks!  This one nicknamed the ""Blackhawk"" by Seiko collectors is easy to like.  Citizen makes a Blue angel combo ana/digital version that costs more and will give most simple users a fit when trying to just simply change the time.  The Seiko BLACKHAWK will be your watch for daily or weekend use while dressy enough for shirts at the office or a jump into the pool.  I own many Seiko's and know that the price on them just continues to go up while not breaking the bank to own many of them.  I wear and love all my Seiko's although I own many watches costing thousands more.  This watch keeps excellent time and I have not been put off that it is a quartz vs. an automatic movement.  The face is bold enough to see all on it without having to lean into it to see time and use features.  The band is good quality and has pin adjusting vs. hollow links that are cheaper and feel flimsy. Bottom line is get one prior to it being gone at under 150.00 these will not last long in the lineup.  Amazon service is excellent and prime was worth it for me to get all my watches in two days with free shipment."
"I love this dress, should have ordered a bigger size but love it very much. Looked good for my anniversary"
"I was very pleased with this purchase! I bought one for myself and one for each of my sisters for Christmas gifts- I printed a little card with it that said ""fallen from the same tree, forever sisters we will be.""
 I was worried ordering these online without seeing the piece in person, but wow, was I pleasantly surprised!  The pendant is beautiful! Nice size - not too big but not too tiny.  I Both my sisters love it. I have received many compliments on it already and I've only been wearing it for 5 days!  Has a lot of detail, seems to be excellent quality sterling, and the chain is also very nice and not too thin. The price was more than fair."
She luvs them
This is my second of these jackets. The first one lasted me close to nine years of hard work around fences and wires before it finally just got too ripped up. It keeps me warm in the winter and I really love it or I wouldn't have turned around and bought it again. I live on a small dairy farm and I'm constantly getting caught on the fencing or chicken wire and it was years before the first rip appeared. The jacket is out in all manner of weather - I'm in Montana. I've worn it down to 20 below with worse wind chills and all I have to add to my inside clothing is a down vest. When this one wears out I'll turn around and buy another. I'm female and the men's small fits me great with room for the vest underneath and I can move easily to do all of my farm chores.
"Wouldn't you love a belt that adjusts after you eat a meal? If you gain or lose a few pounds? These adjust to the perfect fit! Belts with holes just don't do that. Once you try this, you'll never go back to a ""normal"" belt!"
Very high quality.  I recommend buying this purse
The last  would be much smaller than any other lasts of Red Wing shoes.
These shoes are great for a person like myself with wide feet; I wear them every day to work and they provide all of the support I need to be on my feet eight to ten hours a day.
"These are my ""walk around the house"" socks.  They're thick enough, but not too thick you can't wear shoes.  I like these socks.  They last, too."
"I love this jacket and I love that it was only $15. Super soft fleece on the inside, the sleeves were a generous length, and it kept me stylish and warm. Highly recommend. Definitely size up at least one size. I usually wear a Large and I got the XL and it fit perfectly. The hips are the snuggest part, so I'd recommend wearing it with a shirt you tuck in because otherwise it'll kindof bunch up your top. Definitely will be ordering more in different styles and colors, this jacket is now a staple in my closet. If you order it in your normal size, you might just not be able to zip the jacket, but it has a bit of stretch so you shouldn't feel like your bust or shoulders are constricted."
Foot is a bit hard but nice boot
Simple but nice!  The 2 pockets added a nice touch as they had stitch designs on them and were not plain.
"I was a bit nervous ordering these shoes because many wrote how narrow and uncomfortable they were.  I have a difficult fit, yet these shoes were comfortable from the moment I put them on.  The material did not cut between my toes, they were very chique looking, and almost felt like they had an arch support.  I too wish they came in a solid color, but the pair I ordered, red, is lively and fun.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because I have not worn them enough to know if my raves will continue after extended use.  I would definitely buy more, especially at this sale price."
They're boot laces. They work
Very nice looking. It was also easy to put together. Holds everything!
"VERY CUTE; CUT IN AT WAIST, BUT STILL FORGIVES BUMPS, AND CURVES. I wash it in cold and hang to dry to prevent shrinking. Just an all-around great dress...style, fit, and comfort are amazing!"
I wear them almost everyday!  Very comfortable.  Easy slip on.
"Cute shirt, be careful because it does shrink when you wash it so order a size up!"
"Great quality, beautiful and comfortable.  Will be buying a couple more pair as back ups LOL... also will be checking to see what else Besteel has to offer!!!"
"Nice shirt and good quality for the price.  I liked the blue color, which was a nice change from the darker colored Star Wars shirts that my son already has.  Would recommend for others."
Cheap. But cute!
This is so much prettier in person and the fit is perfect if you go by the sizing chart. Love this company and their affordable vintage inspired styles! This is my second year ordering from them and 3rd bathing suit from them!
"This is the second one I own. I own several other types of winter hats, but these Carhartt hats are all I wear anymore. They are very warm and comfortable. There's not a thing I'd change about them. Made in the USA too!"
"I ordered these boots when I saw them on Amazon. I liked the rows of buckles on the side of the boots. I liked how the boots actually stayed up on my legs without slouching. They look nice on. Now here's the deal: the boot runs a little narrow in the ankle area. Because I have small ankles, this wasn't really an issue. I was able to get them on, but I must say that  even on me, I couldn't put them on, and pull them up without first unzipping them. This is something to keep in mind if you have wider calves. It's been my experience that whenever I'd purchase boots that were not made of real leather, the fit always seem to run small, so I ordered a size up in these boots. This being said, when the boots arrived, they really were cute.  Good price. Fast delivery. A good buy overall."
Larger than expected but will keep due to good quality and style.
Does the job well and the color is as pictured. Easy to fold back into its pouch when you're not using it.
Worth so much more than a dollar! Fantastic gift for someone or even as a gift at events!
So many compliments on these shoes!  Love them
Looks adorable on my 3 month old!
"comfortable , look good to fit my trouser-style jeans .
more sales promotion woule be better.
a very good choice"
This shirt is adorable and my son still squeezes in it. I'd recommend a size up because it was a bit short.
"I know it's not an expensive piece but it wears well on my wife & she can wear it all the time & not worry about losing a high dollar piece if chain breaks when she's gardening or whatever, great buy you won't be disappointed!"
"I knocked off a star because they're a little fiddly to get on, because of the lack of zipper. Also, the buckle jingles, so it sounds like I'm wearing spurs. Otherwise, these are super cute and pretty comfortable!"
these are the most amazing boots! wore them for a day and they molded to my feet like I've been wearing them for a year. these are the ultimate comfortable effortlessly shabby chic boots that go with everything! don't think! just buy them!!
AMAZING!!!!!!!! SO COMFORTABLE!!!
"I bought these a while ago and have loved them! Unfortunately, they developed a small hole on the backside, not sure if it was from washing them or my dryer maybe. I love that they don't shrink when you dry them. I'm between 5'4"" & 5'5"", I weigh about 114 pounds, and the small fit nicely. Tight but not too tight to be comfortable. I think I'm going to order a replacement pair or 2!"
"Great life saver! Live on a steep hill. Had a couple of ice storms right after purchase. Mailbox is located at bottom of hill. Usually if you get down, it is almost impossible to come back up. This purchase supplied the traction needed to return to house."
I LOVE MY SNEAKERS COMFORTABLE AND THEY STILL LOOK BRAND NEW.
Good pair of everyday jeans.
"Like the color , the strings are leather and are a little long..."
"Not only are these supercute sunglasses, but they actually seem to stay on my baby's head.  She tolerates them pretty well and they stay secure with the easy velcro mechanism.  As long as the angle of the strap is correct, there is no problem with the strap rubbing her ears."
"I am 5'7"", 149 lbs, size 8/medium, 34 DD. Ordered a large, and it fit perfectly with jeans, can't wear with just tights. I love the extra-long sleeves."
I sent it to someone for St. Patricks day and she really loved it
"I bought this for my 12 year old sister who wears kid's size XL and adult size small. It fits both of us well and is not too short. I'm 5'3"" and it hits about an inch above my knees, so it's slightly longer than I thought. Very pleased with this purchase, since my sister is a huge Adventure Time fan and this was a nice surprise for her =] Just be warned that the fluffy space princess dress is pink, not purple. But the character is still recognizable."
well made and perfect for casual dress..
"The basic review: Quality - Light and solid are the best reference at describing them one foot at a time. Good build, design for weight reduction and fit. There is little comfort with these in terms of soles, a small negative to a pair that are still supportive. Not much time spent wearing, got them on sale too."
The size fit well and it was a good price
"Color is good.  Sizing is good. Nice, thick, high quality hoodie"
LOVE THE PANTS.  I want more in more colors if they had it :)
This top is absolutely gorgeous and of excellent quality. The size is true to the chart and the fabric has a really nice feel. I was a bit skeptical in that I usually wear a large but no regrets with this purchase....love it!
"These shoes are comfortable and roomy, however for the price and the fact that they are advertised as a walking shoe I expected more insole support.  Because they run wide and are roomy I will be able to add an insole for support."
"Gift, it was very well received"
great shoes......i love them what I expected from bcbg
Great for packing shoes and there is room for your socks!
"Very pretty and can wear dressed up or casual.  I bought them to go with a white topaz ring I recently purchased and they are perfect.  But, they go with anything."
good support comfy and look good
"I was offered these Women's Ballet Style Comfort Fit Cotton Socks / Yoga Socks / Low Cut Socks /Pilates Socks / Non Skid Socks / Barre Socks with Non Slip Grip Bottoms for a reduced cost for my honest review..These Ballet  Socks are so cute.

I am not into Yoga or dance so I use them around my home and I put a pair in my purse for when I go to someone else home so I won't be walking around barefoot..The nonskid bottom is great,  makes you feel safe..."
Very comfortable. I considering buying another.
"I love the suit. The colors are beautiful, and the fit is complimentary to my body shape. The only con I have is that I wish the strings to the top were longer, other than that it was a great purchase. I have bought from them before you just have to make sure you know your measurements, don't guess!"
"Up date. So after a bit the company contacted me and sent me new pants and these ones are perfect!!! Thank you so much the customer service is amazing!!!

I ordered the mint and black leggings for my daughter. They fit like Carter's. So a little small. They look adorable but don't wash well. I have washed once and the gold circles have already started to crack. Which is sad because my toddler loves them."
Very comfortable. Will buy more colors.
"Love the shirt, but the size is deceiving.  Size up on these for sure!  Seller was great in taking them back and giving me new ones."
I really like the shoe and it was a good price. My son has worn them many times and seem to be holding up very well.  They are shinier than in the picture but the description is correct.
I love these pjs for my twins. They are so cute and they make the little babes look cuddly and cozy. If you happen to be looking for something to make a Thing 1 and Thing 2 costume these are perfect. I wish I would have done it!
"perfect, says the wife"
"GET A SIZE BIGGER THAN YOU NORMALLY ARE. Ahem. This dress is beautiful and sexy and looks good on multiple body types. My friend and I each ordered one in the same size (2x) because she is very tall with broad shoulders and I am short with big thighs, butt, boobs, and arms. The lace arms fit my arms, but it is snug at the top. If you typically wear a 2X this dress will not fit you in a 2X. I usually wear an XL but I know my arms are large so I got the 2X. It fits both of us great. The material isn't stellar but it isn't cheap. The neckline is very flattering and the dress does not inch up on me."
Very pretty sandal.
A+!
These fit well. And I think they'll make good walking shoes. The inner elastic pinches the dorsal crest of the foot. Hopefully this will loosen up with use.

The shape is not exactly oval; it's hinged so it makes a ""pointed arch"". An interesting Gothic shape results. To me the earrings are classic and 'edgy' both if that is possible. So a 10 for design. Good workmanship - 10 for quality. I hope the little things stay put and don't fall out which is the usual thing with bling. I am very taken with these. Thank you for your excellent service."
This is quite the supportive strapless-- I am a D cup and it looks great on! Love it.
"Beautiful shirt, it fits perfectly, the art work is great, the color is beautiful, quality material, very very good shirt, my favorite t shirt now."
Even tho it was shorter then I expected it was still pretty
"This shirt is a nice, thick material, but not stiff or itchy. The decal is holding up well, it has great detail."
"This bathing suit is magic. Seriously though. Finding an affordable suit that has great support while still looking stylish and modest is a very difficult task. This suit does all of that. The polka-dots are super cute. Couldn't be happier. Sizing was weird though. Thought I ordered the 14/16 but then the size changed to 12/14 in my order history. Just be aware that XXL fits more like a 12/14 than a 16, for sure. If you are on the higher end I would go a size up. The legs are slightly tight but it's stretchy enough it doesn't bother me too much."
"Literally exactly as pictured, stretches how you need, I wore it over a wig and it looked great"
"I like them, I ordered the same size as my all leather pair, which i wear heavy socks.
Maybe I could have gotten and 8.5, I didn't want to deal with returns. The canvas is very stiff
so it will take a while to break them in, my leather took awhile to break in.
They are super cute."
I am a converse fan and know to buy a half size down if you don't like socks with them. very comfy shoes. I wear these on my non running days when I am running errands with my kids etc. very comfortable and stylish
Bought these for work. I work with Kg-1st kids and lets just say Ive learned to keep a few kids belts on hand to save the day. That and I cant stand see a kid pulling there jeans up all the time because the pants are a little big. Just trying to help my little peeps out.
"Great Quality, comfortable, love them!!"
I really lirke these earrings.  They look like the real thing!
Very comfortable sock. Thought after I washed them they would become stiff but they are still very soft and cofortable.
I absolutely love the shoes I would buy another pair of Easy Spirit in a heartbeat
Nice cool and comfortable.  Slightly sheer. Reason for 4 . Have ordered more in darker color.
"all the nathan line suits seem to fit  me perfect and as expected. The quality is there....I have the light blue stripe and the black so far.
the black isn't a flat black, it has almost a light grey micro line in it.  it almost looks dark grey.  better than expected.
the coats are cut ok...for the price. there is a little bunching in the shoulder area, but without getting a custom cut coat, thats usually the case.
for free returns and the price, when below $240 or so... i recommend."
good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good
Look at the sizing and thought I would need a large but no I would have gotten a medium and been happy these really fall off of me and are too big so go by your gut what do you think you would wear. I like the material and the cut.
Nice bracelet.  It looks just like the picture and it is what I expected.  It's a simple bracelet but it's nice.
"PERFACT , LOVE THEM"
Most comfortable shoes I've had yet!
"I love this this sweatshirt! Warm and comfortable fit, with cute graphics."
The baby loved her new robe.
Stunning. Big heel
great compression tee good for posture and back
"I'm 5' and 185lbs
Fit snug, but comfortable"
I love them! Very comfy and good support! ...and I get a lot of compliments from guys and girls!
I ordered the 13-14 size even though I'm a 12 and they fit perfectly.  These socks are very thick and supple .... nicest socks ever ... although my Head socks were really nice too.  Shipping was as advertised ... I'm a happy camper and recommend these socks and this supplier 100%
what can I say-theyre swim shorts-they fit well and were not too short
"He says it works great, so I'm sure it does. No complaints to get a new one :) we are satisfied with our purchase."
I.love.these.pants!
Need to loose my weight
"Love,Love, Love bthese shoes you have to stuff them up a bit because their slippery under the bottom other than that I still wear them they look just that good."
"I bought these because I'm suffering from severe Plantar Fasciitis and 4 different foot doctors including a surgeon has told me that I should be wearing heels 2"" tall or higher because of the shape of my foot.  So I've had to buy all new shoes as all of my other shoes are orthopedic (no, I'm not that old, I suffered from a tear under this same foot 15 years ago and they told me to wear orthopedic shoes, so I have ever since).  Long story short, it's back & this time I'm wearing heels.  These are probably my most comfortable pair next to my wedge 3"" heel sneakers.  They are more comfortable than another pair of Aerosoles I bought that had a five star rating.  I highly recommend them."
Fits perfect and my 7 year old loves it. Its a softer fabric where it feels worn and not stiff.
"These pajamas fit perfectly, and are very durable. I have 4 boys, who constantly wrestle. Clothes and pajamas get torn all the time. These PJ's are holding up quite nicely.  I'm going to order another pair.
The price was great, too!"
"Received my swimsuit in a timely manner! I apologize in advance for the dirty mirror. :'-) Whoops.

Alright, now I was a little worried after reading the reviews about this suit because I wasn't sure if ordering my normal size would work (I ordered size SMALL). I did notice that they updated their size charts last year, so I decided to trust it.

It fits and looks great! I am about a 34B and I fluctuate around 115-125. Most of my weight sits in my butt, so I was worried about the size being too small, but it fit just fine. Maybe just a little snug, but not unwearable! The top fits like a charm. I normally wear size 2 pants, so this may just run a little smaller than normal if it is suggesting it will work for a size 4 person.

My only negative part is that when I received it, the suit itself smelled strongly of cigarettes. :-/ I'm just going to throw it in the washing machine and pray that it goes away."
Love this hat!! Im having a tee shirt pocket monogrammed to match.
Very nice quality and cute!
"Wow.  I have been looking for the right sling pack for weeks.  I have looked at ones costing over $100, U.S. made ones, etc., hoping to find the perfect solution for my needs.  I usually use a small backpack for travel that combines days of hiking and sightseeing.  Meh.  I needed a pack that was:
1.  Flat enough to be able to use over my shoulder for going into a cafe or pub for coffee or lunch or even an informal dinner without benefit of returning to hotel to get changed.
2.  Expandable enough to hold water bottle, guide book, Panasonic FZ200 camera, small jacket, umbrella, etc. for days on the trail or around sights.
3.  Neutral enough not to scream a brand or say rugged.
4.  Practical enough to hold a water bottle in a dedicated mesh pocket that won't catch on things.
5.  Padded enough on the shoulder strap and back.
6.  Water repellent.
7.  Has several practically sized zipped pockets.

Well, for $20.99, I have gotten them all.  I would gladly have paid 5 times the price for this to be U.S. made.

Assuming the pack holds up, which it surely appears it will, I am delighted."
My husband had this wallet for 6 years and wanted something similar to it for Christmas. I came to find that they still sold it so I bought him another one. He was really excited to find out they still made them. Really durable.
"I received this ring at discount to give my Honest opinion. ..
 This is a Beautiful Ring fits very nice not bulky at all.. The Blue inlay is very beautiful. . The comfort fit is great.. I received it promptly... This is a Great product.."
"When I ordered this owl necklace, I figured it would be a great christmas gift for my little sister since she is really into owls and the antique look. Considering how cheap it was my expectations were low, but hopeful. What I did not anticipate was how adorably cute it would be when it arrived! The chain and pendent are made of the same material and color and the gemstones are a touch darker than the image (I blame lighting) but they are still very vibrant. The chain is long enough to go over my head without using the clasp and it hangs just past my chest area. All and all I am very pleased with the product.

The only down side was that one of the eyes was broken when it arrived, I suspect it broke in the process of shipping, but it was a huge let down. I have decided to keep this necklace for myself and I am highly considering ordering a new one for my sister."
"Was looking at purchasing a new watch all together, however purchase this and my old watch looks brand new!!"
Looks good and fits well but thinner than I expected. Doesn't seem like it would be good sun protection. 100% poly so doesn't absorb liquid. You can feel your seat running down your back when wearing this.
The earrings were a nice surprise. They are even more beautiful than on the picture. Great price too!
"I have wide calves and these fit if you button the top button. One button came off during washing, but I am handy and sewed it back on. Super cute and very comfortable. Good length too, I am 5'3."
ABSOLUTELY ASTOUNDING! I was so impressed with the clarity of these stones that I am about to order my third pair. I have had a number of people compliment me thinking they were genuine diamonds. I have paid $45 for cubic zirconia that don't look near as authentic. Order as many pair as you can. Unbelievable price.
"I knew from the other reviews that the grey was a little see through, but it isn't too bad. Nothing scandalous. I have not actually ran in them yet, but they fit me well for a change. Usually I have to get a large for anything on my bottom but they stretch well. They are a nice fabric."
I love this blazer. It is a great color and I can match it with almost any outfit.
"I paid 0.99$ for this with free shipping and am so pleased. I got it for a gift and while the chain doesn't look like it will hold up forever it is decent and can't be beat for the price! Amazon said the earliest it would get here was August 20th and it arrived on the 8th. The pink paint isn't flawless, but again for the price it can't be beat!"
"I love these shoes, I was hoping they lived up to my expectations and the reviews and they thankfully did! I wore them right out the box all day as soon as I got them and they were great! No need to break them in or anything. Very pleased."
But that's okay ....I ordered a size larger this time cause I gained a little. I just role them down some.
"Same as always, no problems.  I don't know what some of the reviews are complaining about but these fit just like always. And they have 7 belt loops."
I really like this bracelet. The colors are fashionable and with the magnet closure it is easy to put on and feels secure.
I've ordered several of these now. They are light and comfortable. Great for hot weather.
I bought these for my wife for Christmas and she absolutely loves them.  The item was perfect - just as described.
Birthday gife
People aren't sure what to think about my cats in space Jansport since I'm a grown man. Initially my wife thought it was stupid looking but she has come around. This backpack is a 5 star conversation starter.
Too cute for words...
My granddaughter loves it and it is well made would get another.
"Ever since I found mizunos a few years ago, I wear no others for running.  They hold up well and fit my feet like a glove.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE them!  And now they're making them in fun colors!  A word to the wise though, they run a half size small."
Well made.  Great swim trunks.  Good value.
I love these sun glasses. They are very cute and very well made. They seem like they are going to last.
Perfect!  Just what I wanted & expected.
"These boots are exceptional.  They are a little stiff at first, but become more flexible fairly quickly.  I like them."
Nice colors. Easy to use.
I have gotten so many compliments on these shoes and also have gotten stopped at the mall and asked where I have purchased them . Amazing price .
"These boots are super light, super comfortable,  and fit as expected"
"These are my new favorite shorts! Super comfy. Stretchy, but snug. I want these in all the colors...but they only have black :(
I'm 5 ft 5, 137 lbs & the medium fits great! A small would probably work, too...just a little less coverage."
These are the best summertime sandals!
Just ordered a 2nd pair in different color.  Very happy with product.
"Only said no about the arch support because I have high arches, but inserting an arch support was all I needed."
i wear these a lot! i just wish they were a little softer on the toes.
"Same as above, both pairs fit perfectly, and I'm very happy !"
Love these! Ordering a few more in different colors!
"I have small hands and this ring is the perfect size for me....
The quality and what I like to call bling effect is outrageous....
From the minute I opened the package it has not stopped shining.....
For $5.99 the ring stands out and unlike some other reviews that I have read I don't understand what they see it doesn't look cheap and by no way too big at all just perfect ....

Don't be afraid to buy from Metal Factory. If you reflect confidence when you wear anything it will show  it is not the jewelry it is the wearer....
Keep them guessing!!!!!"
l love them any who.
Purchased for my 89 yo mother who wears these to keep her toes warm.  She loves her half-socks!
super cute...so comfortable and soft!
"Wow, this is a stunning ring! The black titanium is really set off by the gorgeous sparking simulated sapphires, rendering a quality and luxurious look. It also fits well and the inset simulated sapphires are protected from banging up against other rings. I'm excited to be wearing it for a long time!"
"These are snug but with that lining they are perfect. Due to my preferences I sent them to my ""shoe guy ""(yeah I have one) and he added an extra leather sole so I don't wear them out as fast because I will wear these A LOT (except in heavy snow) so they are perfect now for me. Love these they are the most comfortable slippers/moccasins I've ever had."
"It is hard to tell what size to buy since they give the waist measurement instead of the hip measurement.  I had been wearing these in a size 9, and really liked them, but they are quite snug, so I thought I would try a size 10.  Size 10 is a lot larger than a size 9 in every dimension.  So I returned them and ordered a 9."
"This set is everything its cracked up to be and more. The entire ensemble is of fairly good quality and is a lot of fun when put together. I don't think the jacket would ever leave realm of play clothes but its perfect as the spy trench - ditto for the hat but more so...it's quite cheap.

The included accessories were also a lot of fun, but the real pretend play will be with the trench, hat, and a pair of shades to suit the wearer. As a childhood fan of myriad spy shoes, I was delighted to share this with my niece."
"I have these same exact shoes in the same color as well as other colors but for some reason when these arrived, they fit really tight. I usually can wear the no show socks under my other ones but I can't with these. They are too tight. And even tight without any socks. Not sure why the fit was so tight but I'm thinking I can stretch them out over some wears."
I bought these sandals for my daughter for her birthday. She is a very rock & roll bartender. She loved them. Very unique sandal. Very flattering sandal. She said they are very comfortable. I thought they may look cheap but actually the sandals were of good quality. Thanks again Amazon. So happy with another purchase.
"Love these boots, right out of the box. Look great in person, not too flashy. The rubber is so soft that there was no problem wearing them out of the box,; no break-in time required. Because the tongue needs to be attached to the boot fairly high up, to keep water out, can be a bit tight to get on over the arch, but nothing serious. The rubber is so soft and flexible that it allows for some stretch and doesn't hurt.
Overall:  Funky, comfortable and functional. Brilliant!!! Want to buy another pair for when these wear out ;)"
"I've been in serious need of a pair of rain boots for awhile now. I am very happy with these. They definitely run a little big in the foot area, however in my personal experience, the leg area was a bit snug."
"I was looking for a comfortable tank that doesnt cling to my tummy, and this is perfect.  I am 53, 165 pounds, usually wear womens Large in T-shirts and tanks, and this fits just as expected.  The aqua color was also true to the picture and exactly the color I was hoping for.  Delivery was quick and the price is right, so I puchased another in yellow, which is also just what I was looking for. I will buy more.  Love this top!"
"What I mean by almost like a pair of traditional Ugg boots- While it has shearling throughout the ENTIRE boot like traditional Ugg boots, the shearling in the foot area is not as thick.  However, provided how it looks on knowing there's shearling also on the dorsal side (the top side) of the foot, which all of my non-traditional Ugg boots (the Ugg boots that look like normal boots/ the dressier Ugg boots) don't have, I'd compromise.

It is a bit tight on the ankles when putting on (I have fairly skinny legs and ankle circumference) but once it is on, it feels like a glove."
Excellent sandals for syammer. WON'T last long if used everyday. But for the price best buy
"so cute, excellent quality. I love this"
"I love the look and all the pockets.  With all of the buckles though, it is a little heavy. I will buy the smaller version."
"Very pretty. I'm giving as a gift and I'm sure they'll like it. Only, I took one star away because it did not come as nicely packaged as shown in the photo; no velvet satchel. But that is just a small thing."
"I really liked this bag, it's well constructed and looks really nice. I'm going to use it as a weekender bag because it has a nice size to it.
really glad I got this."
These shoes are very comfortable with great support. I wear a 7-7.5 so I went with the 7.
Amazingly comfy!
Looks stunning in person. Got it for my daughter's graduation dress.
"Bought my husband one of these work shirts to see how it fit and after he raved about the shirt (it became his favorite), I went back and ordered several more in different colors.  He is retired but loves to work in the garden and this shirt is perfect, stays relatively cool in our desert climate and even looks nice for casual wear with shorts.  I cannot recommend this product enough!  (I bought the women's shirt, same style, and love mine too.)"
These boots arrived within a week to the Bay Area. I would suggest trouser socks or some other thin socks. I have not worn them beyond trying them on but anticipate being able to wear them comfortably throughout an 8 hour work day. They won't ever be as comfortable as flats.
Very nice and beautiful belt.fits well too
"The flower design on the shoes were the only issue I had with these shoes because it irritated my skin a bit, but overall the shoes were far more comfortable that wearing heels or other dressy shoes."
I recently purchased these shoes & absolutely LOVE them.  They are the most comfortable shoes I've ever had on my feet.  They are cute as can be & fit perfectly according to size.  Naturalizer has nailed this shoe to perfection.  It has extra soft cushioning & can be worn endlessly without hurting at all. Couldn't be more pleased with these cute shoes. Highly recommend.
This is a stunning ring. It's beautiful and true to fit.
I was floored by how much better this pants are compared to the one in picture. I love it. So comfortable. Great quality!
Love this little pouch. I bought it for my son to pack toiletries on a camping trip. Easy to find items inside and just the right size.
"These shoes arrived on time and came packaged very well. The quality of these shoes aren't bad, I wish they had a bit more durability though, other than that, they are REALLY comfortable and really cute and goes with any outfit!"
"Love it! Nice weight and quality, attention to detail. Zipper in front can be adjusted high or low. Fits a curvy body nicely. LOVE!!"
"Perfect shorts for outside exercise. I bought these for doing dog agility as I needed a new pair of nylon shorts (dog drool - sweat proof!!)  They are great!  Cool, comfortable, easy to keep clean and the pockets are perfect.  They are deep enough to hold poop bags and dog treats. The fit is just as expected.  They are the right length, not too short and not too long. I'm very glad I bought them. I got several compliments and asked where I got them."
I get conpliments everywhere I go. It's a good feeling to see other 2a supporters out there especially when you live in commiefornia . The shirt fits perfect . Ready to wear as soon as you get it .
"I like these shoes, but initially had to exchange them for a larger size (a half size up worked for me), as they run quite small. The style is great, I can wear them all day (usually with thin footie socks). They can rub uncomfortably on the heel, especially before being broken in."
"Pretty, comfortable. Haven't worn outside yet but expect to walk ok in them."
looks very nice and of good quality
Suuuuuper comfy!
These don't roll you out as much as older designs or even the black current style. Very good arch though and comfortable.
nice shirt-great price-comfortable material-great color
god shirt fits great thanks im normaly a small us l/xl in asia styles this is asian the fits good and thight which is hard for me to find in us styles.
"This was a gift for my teen daughter.  It is very nice, lightweight sweater, but it fit her perfectly."
they were too small but i kept them anyway.maybe i can give them to a friend or my granddaughter. they are very pretty.
Grandson loved this shirt!
"Rockports are my favorite brand, they are good quality and never have to worry about fit, that's whay I feel comfortable ordering them on line."
I purchased these for my hubby. Excellent fit and stylish look.
One of the best wearing boots I've ever had! Highly recommend
"Good quality, the number is a little big, I am 175 cm, 188 LBS"
"Love these shoes, wish the toes were a little more waterproof."
So soft and cuddley
"Love this top, very flattering."
Love it .. keeps my baby nice and warm
"Very impressive!  This is a quality belt, even stitching, nice leather, seems very well made.  Being two-tone makes it very versatile, and the silver accent on the tab of the belt is a nice, classy touch.  I normally wear a size 40, but after reading other reviews, I ordered a size 44.  It might be just slightly longer than what I'd call a perfect fit, I believe a size 42 would have been too short.  I have no regrets at all!"
"I got this for the birthday of one of my friends who plays the clarinet. She really likes them.
They are not too heavy to wear and looked great."
This shirt fits good and looks flattering. I ordered another color
"I love these! They are so soft and comfortable and really warm. I bought them because I'm often out at night in the winter and the soft, fleece lining is exactly what I needed to keep me warm without having to wear long underwear. They fit me perfectly (I do have to wear a belt with them, though, but I expected that) and are extremely comfortable to wear for long periods of time in cold weather. The rugged construction washes well, and I haven't noticed any shrinkage.

All-in-all, if you're looking for a lined pair of slacks to wear while working outside in cold weather, these definitely deserve a good look."
item arrived sooner than expected and it is absolutely gorgeous I love it and it looks better in person and pretty on my hand
My absolute favorite pair of running shoes!!!
Nice shirt.  But runs small.  I bought this for my son's birthday as he is an avid bike rider.  Had to exchange for  a large.  Nice quality.  Feels soft.  He really liked it.
These are really cute but they don't have a zipper and I did not realize that when I got them.  They fit good once I'm able to get them on my feet but getting them on is quite a task.  Also the calf is not as wide as I thought it would be.
"I bought these for a costume and they fit well. They aren't baggy and aren't restrictive either. They are a perfect balance of fitmet for tactical pants. Anyone seeking pants that need to fit in that manner, as well as having tactical pocketing, I recommend these"
Great for my costume.  Very comfortable!
"Like the style, thick and warm.  I was  thinking it was fleeced lined but the thickened cuff seems to make up for the fact that it's not."
"I got this wallet based on other reivews and even for the price I'm impressed. the leather is soft yet thick and like another reviewer commented, smells wonderful. I've had Fossil Wallets for the last 15 years and with very few exceptions I prefer this over any of the ones I could get with them.

I looked all over to have an ID window that wasn't an afterthought or ""removable"" component to the wallet that also wasn't sitting on the outside of the folds. I was also looking for something that wasn't the size of my tablet or ""for travel""

everyday, quality, thin, well laid out Wallet!"
very cute on my Grand-daughter!
Easily adjusted but definitely getting your bang for your buck. Not the best quality but for the price I was impressed. Thin and if not arranged properly can see the wig cap through it. A good starter wig for any cosplayer who can't afford anything fancy.
"Great Sweater that worked out very well with me.
Love the colours near the collar."
"I love my Tevas! they fit perfectly. I wanted something that i could wear in the water and not have to worry about comfort or having it slip off. these are perfect, and i love them!"
"I switched to these for a little while after my last full marathon. I generally run in Vibrams because I like a very minimalist shoe. These were actually very easy to switch to because they were so lightweight. They felt great running, no blisters and a nice level of cushioning. They really hold up well too. I love the cute color!"
"This is my first safety shoes i use from Reebok as sport company , worth each cent so comfortable, cosy as i'm working 12 hours and the weight much less than my other safety shoes just only needs to clean it daily but easy , and all my friends they didn't noticed it's safety shoes even, they thought it's sneakers hahaha"
What you would expect from a store bought costume. Bought x small for my petite six year old girl. She LOVED it.
"Doesn't lay as flat as I would like, with that said it is still very nice for the price.  Have already ordered more from this seller."
Really like the quality.  Amazon was the only place I was able to find the sneakers for my son.
"I do not like to wear under ware so taught I would purchase these and pray they are comfortable, well they are most certainly comfortable to the point you forget you have them on.  I am curvy and they fit me perfect.  I will be buying more in the different styles"
Fit well for the cost.
Gave these as a gift and she loves them!
"Excellent support in this bra. It is very comfortable. The lining is a little thin and has absolutely no padding. Overall, a great fit and I would by it again."
"I LOVE THE STYLE OF THE JEANS.
I ORDERED 2 SIZES UP ON THE REGULAR SIZE CHART (SAME CHART I ALWAYS USE)
THEY ARE STILL SNUG AROUND MY BUTT AND THIGHS.
SO IF YOU NORMALLY WEAR SIZE 14/15 AND HAVE BUTT AND THIGHS
BE CAREFUL ABOUT SIZING STARTING TO THINK, WITH THESE PARTICULAR JEANS (MAKER)
MAYBE I SHOULD'A ORDERED FROM THE PLUS SIZE. HA WHO KNEW."
Very high quality and comfortable.  I would buy again.
"Great price for quality sock, I won't wear anything else.  Even with dress clothes : )"
Cute - 4 year old daughter is in the 75th percentile and this fit a tad on the small side but still very acceptable.
"Nice Jacket, fits as expected, good quality."
"the shorts are a little bulky and have a weird fit, but all in all work ok for pre-school."
I have sent a request to see if they would return with an answer  my ?  WAS IF I COULD HAVE GOTTEN ANOTHER  3 BRACELET FOR CHRISTMAS FOR MY DAUGHTERS
The material is nice and thick however it's very form fitting. And the split is not that high or open but overall very cute dress
"I've had Fruit of the Loom t-shirts for decades, the quality is great, the material thickness just right."
"These are really cute.  The heel is high enough to be fashionable, but sturdy and stable."
"i love Olukai shoes and sandals, excellent quality and comfort"
Love shirts very comfortable
Awesome fit and very flattering cut! Great price and great quality. Highly recommended.
"Fit good, everyone liked it"
"really love how well made these are. I also like that they have tougher fabric but not too tough that they are itchy.  fit perfectly on my daughter who is five four.
no itchy seems. and the elastic waist has a lot of give to it."
Perfect heel height for work. My 2nd pair of these shoes. Love them!
Beautiful dress! Well worth the price.
Awesome second set I have ordered and I can't complain one bit.
"Great style, sleeves a little snug, not as well insulated as I expected."
"Got these for my son, he works outdoors shoveling and plowing, and this is exactly what he needed. Fit perfect. Went with a 28"" length so he wasn't stepping on the bottoms. He was very appreciative to have a nice pair of Carhartt's."
Size and color are as expected.
"Extremely comfortable, great traction."
"This is a really cute costume! It fit me pretty well and the little details like the arm bands and belt were cute too. The arms bands and belt are both thin and attach via velcro. I was looking for a costume thats cute but doesnt show too much skin or is too sexy and this fit the bill perfectly! Overall, I would definitely recommend this as a halloween costume."
"I washed these before putting them on and was pleased to find that they fit me exactly as I like. Just loose enough for comfort and the length was perfect for me,which is surprising as I have short legs. I am 5'8"",taller people,or those with long legs and short midriffs might be advised to get a larger size."
I wear a size 8 and I fitted in a 9. They are comfortable and I've got compliments too! I got the silver ones and they are nice. Basic but difference than a plain sandle. I would recommend but size a size up.
I absolutely love this dress. The material is really good.  Wore it to a wedding and it was perfect for it.
Very nice quality and true fitting product for that Star Wars lady (or small man) in your life
Very comfortable and reasonably priced! Please and would buy again.
very nice cami
Yes Very good razor. Well made and very smooth  shaver. This razor is mild to medium aggressiveness. Very forgiving no issues with nicks are cuts shaving with model
I recommend it. It is exactly as published. I arrive at the stipulated time. Good product. Greetings from Mrida - Venezuela
"I had plantar fasciitis and this sandal helped me a great deal. I wear it all time in the house when walking. Great quality. Since I used this is just inside the house, I have not used it in the rain/outside weather...."
these are simply beautiful
Definitely one of my bet purchases yet! I received numerous compliments on its appearance and it helped that it was so comfortable! Love this!
Very very comfortable
"I really like these shoes.  But they are big.  I ordered in a 9.  I am ALWAYS a 9 or 9.5. I own many Merrell shoes and all of the ones I own are 9 in sandals and 9.5 in tennis-shoes or boots.  These shoes in a 9 are big in width, length, and overall.  I have to exchange them for an 8 (which I never, ever wear.) You should know that the buckles are functional.  If you have wide or fat feet, you can adjust them.  The buckle closer to the toes has no elastic.  The buckle closer to the ankle has a little elastic give so it's pretty comfortable for walking in.
I purchased the grey/blue color and it's a nice neutral that will look good with dark jeans. Will up date when I get the 8 and wear them a bit. Hope my review is helpful to your purchase decision."
This is a quality hat.
I returned these and did not reorder. You need them a full size smaller. I had tried them on in a store and still ordered a half size too large. Instead I bought the leather version on sale elsewhere. Very sharp looking and dressier. I may reorder these. Product quality is good.
My Son is a Power ranger fan . We got these as a christmas gift. He loved it fit him nicely. We like the fabric and color. Its a good purchase.
Wife loves it.  So soft and machine washable.
Great top- fits really well-I have 3 so far! Will be ordering more colors!!
loving the arch support.
"I received this ring quickly and in a nice box. It is beautiful!!  True to size so it fit perfectly. It looks real and it shines!  I was really impressed by the quality.  The only complaint I have is the band don't fit snug up to the ring, but other than that, it's perfect!!"
Love these boots! I tried to find them in black too but they weren't available anywhere.  They are super comfortable and stylish.  Look great with skinny jeans and under bootcut jeans as well.
"Great Belt, excellent quality, handsome appearance. Shipping and packaging was perfect."
I love these cant wait to get another
Loved it! Wore it to the Renaissance Festival and felt like a fairy queen in it..just perfect.
"This Osprey 55 allowed me to pack for a 10-day Eurotrip - this included all my clothes, toiletries, and even two pairs of shoes. There are very useful functions built into this backpack - 1) the detachable daypack. This was good for carrying my personal effects throughout my vacation. It also came in handy when we took smaller planes with smaller baggage requirements; I simply detached the daypack and had one carry-on and one personal item. 2) a zipper to hide the backpack straps. This came in useful when I had to put my backpack under the bus. I didn't want my straps all over the place, so I just used the back cover to zip up all my straps (effectively creating a duffel bag). 3) the opening was key. It allowed me to just unzip and see everything.

Overall I would recommend this purchase to someone who needs to pack a lot in a compact fashion. Also, even if you're not ""backpacking"" through Europe (which I wasn't), consider carrying a backpack rather than rolling your suitcase across the Parisian cobblestones."
super cute socks--love them and have ordered for myself and for gifts.
"6 pairs! I'm very pleased with these. 'Seem a little on the thin side, but other than that, very good quality."
"I love these boots!!!! Only took wearing them twice to break in and fall in love with them. I wear them working  with my horses.
And they are so cute too...the pink stitching at the top is really neat!!!"
"Good fit, comfortable and stylish. Holds "" the girls"" in place without uniboob."
Love k swiss joggers always fit and are great for hours of walking
"I enjoy my new 513 jeans and find them comfortable. I have purchased several 514 in the past, but I was beginning to feel that that style was not tapered enough at the ankle to fit today's fashion. I also own 511s that have a more tapered fit but I don't generally find them appropriate for all occasions. One other note, my 514s seem to get stretched out after a day or two and become to look a little less fresh - my hope is that the 513s with their small amount of elastic will retain their shape better."
Got this for my youngest Daughter.  She thought it was the neatest thing ever.  Great Quality and looks just as good as the picture.  The Necklace is that sturdy leather material.  So will last a long time with little ones.
"A very nice shoe for the price that I got them for at the end of the season. I wouldn't pay 50 for them though. My child's foot is really narrow so they are just a tad wide for her, but generally Puma run narrow and seem to be true to size. I ordered a size 13, my child wears a 13 normally and they fit with a little room to grow. I like that they are leather so my child's feet don't sweat. Puma usually makes a very nice shoe. Her friends loved them."
Very cute bras worth the price!
Love this!!! I'm 5'8 and it fit me perfectly!!
My daughter loves this shirt great buy
"You just can't find these in a store anymore, and they are my husband's favorite.  To bad Levi's doesn't make as good a quality jean as they did when Made in USA."
Love it. The wrap comes untied more often than I like but I love the fit and that I can nurse twins without being completely bare on top. I  plan to buy other colors.
"LOVE this one over all the others I have purchased before (Moet Fashion).  The neckline is high enough to hold in the warmth, but not too high.  It is even softer than the Moet Fashion ones, and roomier as well. I suppose the others will fit better under clothing.  I personally prefer this one.  I wear a 16-18 pant."
I got it for my 2 1/2 yr old great granddaughter and it is perfect.  Quality is excellent and she loves it. She makes the prettiest little Tinkerbelle I have ever seen.
"If you have Carhartt pants, this is a must!"
Very cool. I received compliments on my overall costume and it accented it great.  I do suggest to open the package and hang it right away as it come pressed in the box.  I even hit it up with a little steam and it was perfect.
"It's way smaller than the picture, but still makes for a cute sweatshirt - I'm about 5'3"" and it goes about three inches past my hip-bones. The fabric is kind of thin, but it feels really silky and it's very warm. It's really comfy, just be aware that the fit is way smaller than it looks in the picture."
"I like the cami.  It is tight but I would say that it is supposed to be.  I ordered a medium which I can usually do, but it is really tight.  I will get a large next time.  I plan to buy more colors."
Very cute and comfortable. Somewhat see through but I wear them around the house so it's alright.
Love it.  Great length.
"I have a number of issues with my feet, including plantar fascitis. The price was right, so thought I'd try them. Would definitely recommend."
"fast ship, great bag at a great price
grand daughter loved it
highly recommend"
These are so darling. They fit great and are comfortable and I love them. Great color. Really fun shoes.  Thanks
"Not really one for giving 5 stars but I really like these pants. The material was thicker than I expected. Because of this, I don't know if I would wear them in the hot summer months. The inseam is spot on. It doesn't hang down to my knees like some other ""big and tall"" pants. The length of the pant legs is fine, if you are 7' tall! I'm 6'1 and definitely need to take these up. However, that was perfectly fine with me. I lost count of the number of sweat pants and what-not that I purchased that shrunk so much it felt like I was now wearing clam diggers."
Their stockings.  They fit.  Nicely opaque and they don't fall down.  Great quality and would buy again
Great company. Good quality and service. Highly recommend!
Received shirt as expected
Our little guy looks so cute in these. I'm always a little hesitant to purchase onesies/bodysuits online because you never know how they feel or fit. These were exactly what we were looking for and at a great price!
I was looking for a new bathrobe for my husband. I wanted something earth friendly and was hoping for it to be in a fabric that would wash well because my husband is stinky -  frequent washing is a necessity. Linen fabric is extremely strong and long lived so I saw this with the beautiful  blue color and had to give it a try. Hubby and I are both very pleased with it.
"Nice quality, not thin or cheap fabric"
I like this....  comfortable....control.....does what it says....
I just got these yesterday and I love them! They're classy enough to wear for dressy occasions and casual enough to wear on my usual t-shirt days. I have very wide feet and have a hard time finding good shoes. These fit the bill. They are very comfortable and look great on my feet. Definitely a keeper!
Not quite as soft as I thought it would be. Im 54 & it reaches my ankles. Sleeves are like three quarter inch sleeves
Is Levi's
flannel pants.  work as expected
"Good, especially for the price.  Bought it to be in the car roadside box.  Very strong petroleum odor and needed to be off-gassed for several days. Haven't worn it yet, but looks like pretty good quality.  I like that it has a hood as well (especially because I live in the Pacific Northwest)."
"great soaks, run a little large, very good quality, they last long, long time"
Love them. They r comfy and perfectly fitted.
"I got this for my brother-in-law for Christmas and my sister reports that he's in love.  Apparently he used to have a similar one in the '80s before comics were cool and this reminds him of that.  The fabric was soft and seemed durable, it was perfectly his size, and... as I said he loved it.  I think it was his favorite gift."
"Made well with enough cushion for my son. Loved the colors, was exactly what I was expecting!"
"These boots are very cute & comfy! They run small, so I would order a size larger."
I love these shoes.  So comfortable I brought another pair in brown.
"I am going to sadly need to return this one because it is too small, but beautiful, and very nicely made!"
"these fit great are super soft and comfy and look great! Perfect for my crawling infant, great quality from a trusted brand."
"Added a silver cowboy belt buckle I made and use it often.
Not quite as sturdy as some of my better leather belts, but will probably outlast me."
"I purchased this ring as a gift to myself after my law firm had a particularly great week. Emerald is my birthstone, but the stone itself can be pretty delicate, so I'm always on the lookout for classy emerald jewelry at a reasonable price. That way, when I inevitably bang my hand against a wall, I won't feel as bad if the stone takes a beating.

When this ring arrived, I couldn't believe how beautiful it was. The center stone is a clear kelly green and looks perfect set against the flecks of diamond and yellow gold accent. I get daily compliments on this piece, and would happily purchase jewelry from this seller again and again."
"I love, love, love the luxurious feel of this robe.  I'm going to order another!"
"Very nice hat!  Good quality, substantial fabric, adjustable in size, wired edge to adjust the look or coverage, nice little bow on the side fancies it up a bit.  I am very happy I bought it!  It's also an outstanding value considering the style and quality."
This is extremely cute but it is really really big.
"Update: Amazon stated I purchased this October 5, 2015. Wow! I wear this every single day Mon-Friday and it is just starting to show wear and tear. Talking about a great investment! Nothing changed prior to my last review. Color never changed or anything. Below I added updated pictures how the strap is starting to come loose in one part and Im not complaining at all. Im a germaphone and clean this thing everyday with sanitizing wipes and it has yet changed.

I love this. I use it to keep up with my card card at work. Sometimes I place it around my neck or keep it handy on my handbag."
fabric is thin and flowy.  Color is as described.  I wash it in a sweater bag to protect the fabric and then I hang it to dry.
"Love the style and color, wish fabric was a little thicker because it's slightly revealing (had to return the white one.)"
Good material that fits great and keeps my face warm.
"Great sun protection, fit, and look. I ended up giving them to my boyfriend because he liked them so much!"
I ordere a size up cause I could tell it ran small.
Had to take the inner sole for it to fit comfortable otherwise a bit tight.
"I ordered this in a size 5 but it was a tad too small so I exchanged it for a six. The size 5 was absolutely beautiful with perfect details. The size 6 Is OK but I noticed the details are more squished instead of defined. I should've sent it back and exchanged it with the hopes of getting a better looking one,  but I did not want to bother with the hassle again."
but comfortable enough.  Nice cotton liner.  Hugs body so that clothes do not pull down with movement. Would probably purchase again when needed.
"My favorite pair of shoes for working out in my home gym. They're low profile, sturdy, lightweight, and fit like a glove. They do run a touch on the small side, I had to go a half size larger than my asics and new balance running shoes. They seem very well  constructed and can take quite the beating. I like them for the fact that in more cardio intensive exercises the shoes seem to hold your feet well and won't roll over the side like some of my running shoes. When they get old and worn I will buy another pair, hopefully the colors won't be so Nickelodeon by then."
Good quality and nice thickness.
I bought two pair and I love them.  They are comfortable and good looking.
"Super Sexy and very comfortable. I can wear these all night. Much easier to walk in than my 6"" Daggers. I bought my usual size and they fit great."
"This is my first attempt with liquid eyeliner. I usually use a ""smudgy""stick, so this will take some getting used to.

The applicator seems first rate. Very fine point. Very clear line.  I love that the liner cleans off easily, leaving no raccoon eyes.

This particular ""operator"", however, needs to watch more YouTube videos on how to apply liquid eyeliner when you have very thick eyelashes that naturally curve up!"
The Bag is as described and will work well for the intended use.
"This is a very cute dress with a light, soft fabric and embroidered lace details. It looks a bit more casual than I had expected, but it is quite adorable on and can be dressed up or down!"
It's so beautiful!!!
I usually wear a 13 but they were a tad tight so I went with a 14.
"I just recieved this cover up in time to take on vacation. I ordered it in blue( which is beautiful) I also ordered a medium although I am petite, the medium fits great and I just may rush order another color to take along with me ....very pleased!!"
"This shirt is even more adorable when you actually see it!  I bought it for my granddaughter, who is a big Elmo fan.  She just loves it, and I am so pleased with how it fits and holds up after washing."
"These are very cute. I'm 5' 5"" and about 130 lbs, so i got a medium to be sure the leggings wouldn't be too small and they fit well. Slightly loose in the butt area, but better than being too tight! Look great. I ordered a blue and a green to start. Excuse the low-quality photos!"
"Hat was too tall for my 10 year-old, but he still loves it.  The quality is good and the snaps hold the back closed securely."
"Great style and the micro fiber shirt is real light.
I returning thisnshirt and will reorder one size larger."
I got these in a size 11 and they fit more like a 9. I'm still able to get into them but they're rather tight. I'm usually a size 9 but got this larger since they're skinny jeans and known to run small. They have a glittery material that has some stretch. The sparkle fades after a few washes and they will shrink if you dry them on anything higher than medium heat. I suggest air drying them.
perfect for my sis for our Mothers ashes
I bought these for my husband. He uses them mostly to run in. They are nice quality and look good on. They wash good too.
I got this for an international day for employee picnic. It fit me as expected.  I thought it was going to be longer and I could get away with wearing it for a dress but not so much.
"nothing but comfort and good look, as expected"
all I can say its soooo adorable on my son!!
"It fit very well except the pants seemed a little tight in the waist.  Except for the waist, it seems to run pretty true to size.  If you want your child to wear it for more than one year, you might even want to size up.  The material is a good quality and it worked very well for the wedding that my son used it for.  I didn't care too much for the tie at all as the material was a little cheap and I didn't like the pattern."
I bought these for my husband and the legs have cuffs on them. The cuffs are snug and cause the legs of the underwear to ride up.
"The first pair I ordered were too large. Had to return and get the next smaller size, fits better but if they had half sizes I would have gone down another half size. Love the look though."
A little to short but I love how it fits
These are my go to working out socks! LOVE!!!
At last pastel colors for big and tall men
Great value- good color break from black
"Wished I would have bought one size larger, very cute and wash up nice."
"Great shoe, but the color choices are atrocious! Wish there were more normal color options. Seriously the most hideous shoe I have ever worn. Also, it's a little snug, hoping that it fits during the long runs."
"I bought the medium and then had to return it, it was too big and I didn't buy the small because I don't think it would be as tight as I want it to be. So I am going to try a different style shapewear. Overall I thought this was nice, the seams in the front would definitely be noticeable if you wore a tight camisole."
"I had a hard time picking a size since I tend to run between 12 and 14 in pants, but the 0 to 12 fit perfectly.  They are so soft and comfortable.  I bought them to wear for halloween, and I can't wait!"
I like how light and comfy they are. I have only used it so far for home work out videos works great on my hardwood floor.
"I am giving this 4 stars only because I have not received my passport to be able to try it out.  The passport holder was exactly what I wanted.  Room for passport, cards and cash with a snap closure.  I really do not care for anything that does not have a secure closure so this was perfect.  When I get my passport, I'll try it and change the rating."
"Cute stylish flip flops, I love that the soles are the same color as shoes."
These are great quality and durable.
Very comfy and fit perfectly. Will probably buy another pair.
Fits like picture. Love it ...
"Very comfortable and stylish . I bought these for my husband. They are great slides.,he doesnt like the lip flops with thong between toes.these are great fir him."
I am thrilled to finally be using something better than plastic stays.  These stays are a great value and work perfectly.
Wife loves them bought two pair.
Seems to run small to me. I took them to a shoe repair shop and had them stretched and now they fit perfectly.
"Before you order this blouse you have to double check the size. I usually order small because I'm petite, 5'1 in height. So when I ordered this I check it well and I got the right size. I ordered Medium. Perfect for me and I love it. Perfect for summer "
"I love this sundress I have bought some like this over the years and they never fitted  right in the bust area. This dress fits perfect, I am going to buy me a couple more!"
"I LOVE this style of Rocket Dogs and wished they continued to make these!!  I have several pair and in different ""prints"", but Rocket Dog doesn't seem to make this style anymore, so I was thrilled when I found these through Amazon!  So comfy & stylish!"
I have received many compliments. I wear a S/M and I up sized to a L it fit just right.
I gave this pendant as a retirement gift to a fellow worker.  It is classy and not cheap looking at all. The person I gave it to loved it.
Just what you would expect from a Vera Bradley product!!!! Great value!!!! Lovely to look at!!!
"I bought these for my 5 year old daughter and she likes them, which is a relief because she can be very picky about shoes.  They seem to fit her very well and were not too tight.  Just want to point out that if you child has a wider foot, these do seem a bit more narrow than normal.  The lights are a really cool feature for kids, as the whole cat on the side of the shoe lights up whenever you step.  The price on these shoes is really good and you probably can't go wrong with these.  Like I said, just watch out if you child has wider feet and if your child'c school has dress code rules about lighted shoes (as ours does) that might deter you from buying these."
"My daughter is obsessed with the Palace Pets, and she picked out this book bag to use in school this year.  It is a good size for her (she's in first grade), because it will hold a full-sized piece of paper without a problem.  The lunch bag attaches to the outside of the book bag with velcro, and the folder is a great addition to the set.  The zippers are cheap plastic, so they probably won't last beyond a year, but that's okay because I'm sure we'll be buying a new one next summer.  Overall, very pleased with the set."
"This is a great shirt. Heavy weight fabric and nice, slightly aged logo to give it the automatic ""worn"" look. I ordered one-size larger than normal based on reviews and am glad I did. Really comfy."
"Clever colors, and so far they stay in place all day (no creeping down under heels and into shoes).  I haven't laundered any yet.  Hopefully the fit will stay just as good as when they were brand new."
"Love this top!  This is a nice  light weight top for a cool relax feeling, also wonderful price point."
"What is better than a soft squishy platform and heel?  No one would ever know they are Crocs!  I've had these in my ""saved for later"" for almost a year - only because I've been wearing my old version to death.  They are now so faded they look grey, so it's time for a new pair.  They are comfortable, easy to clean, and look good too!  I can chase my 2 year old or go to a fancy dinner with no issues.  The only caveat is they are slippery when wet - so if the floor (I mean floor, not concrete or asphalt) is wet, you will slip/slide on the floor.  Also, if your feet get wet, the shoes are a bit slippery too.  However, they are not designed to be water shoes, so I would say be careful walking inside from a rainy sidewalk.  Otherwise these are a winner. FYI, my size is 11m."
"They did their job, but they are to be used very gently. I dropped them on concrete and they shattered into pieces."
"Great fabric, love the fit."
"Just shipped it in today, and I like it...It's nice and loose the way I like it...if you want it more fitting then order it a size down."
My husband loved the fit and it was not to tight around the waist.
They look great - nice packaging as well - which is good because they are a gift.
"Very lightweight (I hate heavy earrings) and beautiful.
Nice quality"
Amazing pants. They fit wonderfully!
These are comfortable shoes that fit well. I have plantar fasciitis and I am pleased that these shoes do not seem to trigger symptoms quickly into my walking.
It was to replace a whire gold chain my cat broke....hokding a small white gold cross I have worn for iver 20 years....i needed a dainty chain for this cross and I have been wearing it over a week now and love it.  Its perfect
"this is the second guatemaian  columbia belt i have gotten , i still have the first belt they last and look like new they do not roll like some belts  the first is 4 years old. i give it a ten  most items like this last a year. thanks Mike."
"This hoodie is super soft, and the cowl neck is cute. My daughter likes it and it looks cute on her. Bought her one for Christmas, and one to donate to a less fortunate child. "
These sandals are very comfortable and everyone notices them.
My husband loves the fit of these jeans. The weight of the denim is good for cool weather.
"I ordered this hat for my son for a school presentation on Australia. Score because the hat fits me too! This hat is made of very durable thick cotton material. There are snaps available on two sides so if you prefer to wear the brim snapped you may. There are also ""air holes"" around the top of the hat that are covered with a mesh material to allow air circulation to your head. The hat comes with a chin strap that is adjustable with a small plastic spring loaded slider so you can adjust the length of the chin strap. The slider can come off but you can very easily reattach it to the strap. What attracted me most to this hat was the price. I honestly was not expecting much, given the inexpensive price tag, but I was pleasantly surprised when I received the hat. It feels well made and even though I ordered with intention of using it only for my son's presentation, I'm sure I will find myself using this hat often.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tropic-Hats-2-3-4-34-Wide-Brim-Men-Safari-Outback-Summer-Hat-w-Snap-up-Sides-Olive-Medium/dp/B00IO080TQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tropic Hats 2 3/4"" Wide Brim Men Safari/Outback Summer Hat w/Snap up Sides - Olive Medium</a>"
"Have worn Champion products for years dating to when all their clothes were made in the USA.  Wish they still were, but so far can't complain about quality, fit, or color of this shirt.  Very comfortable, and looks as good as you can expect a sweatshirt to look.."
"Didn't pay attention to the sizing warnings and deluded myself into thinking I wasn't *really* an XXL jacket wearer.  But I am.  And I had to return the XXL for an XXXL.  However, the XXXL fits fantastically.  It's not designed for men with large girths, but for operators.  So an XXXL operator is probably solid brick-wall muscle.  I don't have said muscle but I do have the girth so this jacket just fits strangely compared to other styles.  Arms are too long now that I have the triple X, but the attachment cuffs fix that problem and that aren't so long that it looks like I have accordions on my arms.

Jacket has so many pockets I've considered taking a college course in the operation of the jacket.  But I love them.  Color is spot on Coyote.  Stitching is great quality.  Love the hook and loop on the arms.  Hand warmer pockets are almost on the chest, but were not as awkward as I expected them to be.  Lots of options in those pockets for phones, key attachment etc.

Water resistant but I wouldn't call it an rain jacket.  I keep the hood out since it pillow-fies the collar when it's stowed.  However, it has a hook and loop tab that keeps the hood from flopping open while out.  I like it and think it looks better out.

Electronic device (e.g. iPhone/Android) friendly.  Lots of pockets perfect for it with exit holes for headphones to be run discreetly throughout the jacket.

Bottom line, I highly recommend it, but heed the sizing warnings."
Love! 
"This winder is everything it says it is. I'm not so sure you couldn't hear it running on a dresser or nightstand at night, but its not always running. I keep mine inside a nightstand and I never hear it. Its a shame to keep such a nice looking piece out of sight. I have mine set to run 3'30"" every 56 minutes and it keeps my Tissot Powermatic 80 running for when I'm ready to wear it. So far the winder has been a very good purchase."
nice bag easy to wear
Impeccable condition! Fits perfectly.
"Great fit  difficult to find my waist size, they were long I had to cut them  would buy again they do dirty quit they are a  magnet for dirt"
This was a gorgeous bracelet and my mom loved it for Christmas. Highly recommend this bracelet for a gift or for yourself!
"Because I had ordered other pants that were too small, I took a chance and ordered these one size bigger than usual, and they were HUGE.  Thankfully, they are comfortable enough to wear as PJ's. :D"
"I work for a medical retailer where we are constantly standing and walking all day. I am typically a Dansko and Alegria wearer (I love both!), but my shoes weren't cutting it anymore.

I traditionally have a higher arch and instep and had used Sanita in the past. I loved the support! They are different from Dansko despite the similar design.

I ordered these shoes, mostly because of the great price. When I got these, there were a few surprises, (had I fully read specs/reviews I would have already known).

First off the leather is PU, which simply means it is not real leather. In turn, that means it will scuff easier but it will also be lighter and possibly break in faster. I scuffed these the 3rd day I wore them to work. They also felt broken in on that 3rd day.

Second, these are not like traditional clogs in the sense that they have a thin foam sole. They are not hard. I didn't know how I would feel about that since I like that extra firm support, but... these have been so pleasant! I have been wearing these for about 2 months and theyve just gotten better.

Third is simply my concern when people buy shoes like this. Please understand, traditional clogs like this are supposed to fit different from normal shoes. Since I was familiar with European sizes and Sanita I ordered the correct size. Proper fit means the top of the shoe (padded area) should initially fit a little snug as to hold the shoe on. That is because the back of the shoe should slip! Your heel should not be flush with the back; a pinky finger width of room is appropriate. There are multiple reasons behind this but the most notable is so you have a natural gait while you walk.

And last, the height is great! They appear to be the same height as Dansko but actually are about 1/2 inch shy of that Dansko height which makes them less stressful to walk in (talk about buckled ankles) and more ergonomical.

Overall, if you're ok with fake leather go with these! If not, you're gonna have to pay a little more. I would recommended these to medical professionals or anyone who is standing all day. If you're unsure about the size, maybe locate a specialty shoe store in your area and see what they recommend."
This ring is beautiful.  I get compliments on it all the time.
"Gave this to my mom, she loved it for like a month. Haven't seen it in a while."
I love these shirts! I bought 4 of them for my boyfriend's son and they look really nice!
They are  very  comfortable.  The only problem is the shoe laces need to be longer it is hard to tie otherwise they are great shoes and I really enjoy them.
I buy these often. They are my go to stockings. They last through a few wearings. They are yummy to the touch. They have a very silky feel to them. Outrageously sexy on my legs. Love them!!
"This is the first time I've worn Daniel Green slippers and I love them!  They slip on nicely even if I'm wearing socks.  My feet are warm without sweating and I love the ""cush"" in the sole - all day comfort!"
These boots are super cute!  Only 4/5 stars because the dark fuchsia is much more of a bubblegum pink color (still cute - just not *exactly* what I was expecting).  Tons of compliments!
"These are very comfortable summer shoes. I especially like mesh that allows air flow. They wash nicely, too."
"The pendant is larger than I thought, but very nice looking. It will be great to
wear this summer, when it gets hot in Phoenix."
"So adorable! Bought this as a Christmas gift for my crazy cat lady Grandma and she loved it! She's so hard to buy for and since there's plenty more of these I know what I'll be buying her from now on, LOL."
"I order several in different colors,  I wore them all day at Dollywood and my feet never hurt me. The colors are great. I had bought my first pair in a local store and loved they, I looked on Amazon and found more colors and have order all colors but 2 and have they in my cart."
"These work pretty well. I especially like how they work on wet hair. My daughter still screams when I brush her hair, though, so it hasn't helped much with that."
"glad it was a lil longer than needed, beats being too short. I like these for tennis shoes, not so much for a boot."
"Living on a caribbean island sizes for large bust are limited.  Thanks to the thick band underneath, this bra provides lots of support whiles keeping the girls in place.  And this is despite that fact that I bought it a size to small.

I have gain some weight and bought the bra in my regular size of 34FF to start exercising but did not take the weight gain into account.

Still this bra provides enough support that I can do my cardo execises with no discomfort."
Not to tight and doesnt fall!
So many compliments on this dress it is beautiful.
"My husband swears by these. He works in the forest and needs rugged, heavy duty gear.  He has been buying these for years and Amazon has equivalent pricing if not better."
"These shoes are awesome, extremely comfortable and unique, the color scheme is great.  Safe to say nobody else will be wearing these in any foursome you are ever in.  Great item, especially for the $$."
"Great quality. Son has used for several months on a daily basis - either carrying a gazzilion lbs of books or use for a quick overnight. The backpack still looks great, Seams and zippers are perfect. Thanks for a quality backpack."
"nice shirt, fits good, very happy with my purchase."
Wish it was shorter.
"Here my take on the boot.  I'm buying a second pair after a year wearing the last pair.  On the size just buy your size .  when they break in they fit great but if size big they break in to big. The Laces are so annoying coming un done every 3rd step.  It is a nightmare to keep tied and they are a t too long for some reason, I triple tie the knot to get them to stay tied.  Why use pharchute  cord?  I guess they make things different in China.  Yes I  originally thought these were made in the USA. Rocky \ Colorado Rocky mountiians kinda made in the USa  nope Chinese to my dismay.  These failed my breaking apart by 3 months shoe test . I have never seen a shoe I don't destory or damage somehow.  The seam on one boot started to tear by the lace eylet  oh and pray you don't lose the tip off the lace.  Impossblie to re thread with said ""NATO "" eyelet  I guess NATO means pain in butt.  These boots are the most comfy lightweight, cool looking in a strange punker amry prepper, burnner guy I wear these every day and they last but not too big just the size you always get  there speed laces, a pain at night to take off but easy to lace up in.morning. There meant for cops to set in there locker to dress for there shift they pull the lace tie and go .  Get these boots the differences is the sole being flat looking without the stupid.treking boot soles every where.  These are for the Guy on the move'. I run in these babies some days. They look good in shorts too kinda tactical and practical. Get them there great!"
"Don't wear them long enough for arch support to be an issue. Love the slippers, they fit perfectly."
"This is not only my first Skecher shoe but also my first shoe with memory foam and I absolutely LOVE it.  It is, without any doubt, the most comfortable walking shoe I have ever owned.  I suffered a spinal injury some years back and have trouble walking for any length of time on hard surfaces (like the mall) without a lot of pain coming on.  These shoes have given me a lot more freedom in that regard, I doubt I ever buy another sneaker without memory foam in the future and probably will stick with skechers as the overall quality of the shoe seems really good as well."
Very cute but the leather doesn't look as good as the picture.  The leather looks a little fake but hey the price was great.  The luck box is the perfect size for what I need.  I breast feed and I need a bag big enough for 12 hours worth of food and snacks and 3 or 4  small bottles.  Oh yeah and it has to do all no make me the person who hogs the one work fridge.  Perfect size and the padding is awesome.
"Good bag, but it was bigger than expected."
"My daughter loves these pants, they didn't have them in her size so I bought a size up and they hang off her, I have to put a big diaper pin in the waist at the back they're so big but she's loves these and wears as much as I'll let her, drives me nuts, go figure!"
I just love this outfit. It is made well as it is lined inside. My son loved pulling on the turkey feather portion but other than this he kept the feet on and the hat (beak). It is easy to access diaper for poopie messes. Everyone enjoyed seeing my son in this outfit for thanksgiving.
"I am very pleased of this item Seiko women's 5 automatic because its very durable, until now still shine and never fade . the size its fit on my wrist. and easy to look at the time. I gave it 5 stars because I am very satisfied and happy."
Great deal! Buy it now!!!
"This coat is warm, comfy, and has a nice shape for a little girl. The sleeves are a smidge long but with the pink lining they look cute folded up. It seems to be made well and the zipper works without hitches."
My daughter loves them!  She loves anything pink of course!
"THESE PANTS FIT GOOD, JUST CATCHES A LOT OF LINT FOR MY JOB.  OTHER THAN THAT I AM SATISFIED WITH THE COMFORT, SIZE AND QUALITY OF THE PANTS."
"The style of this shirt is fantastic. However, I found the shirt to run a little small and the torso was a little short. Thank goodness that layering is always on trend."
fits well. looks very sexy. hugs curves
My GF loves this shoes
Material seems well knitted together. Better quality than I expected.  Looks better on me than in the ad lol.
Always a great fit!!
"Nice fit, but does not fit as stated ""Oversized"". I will keep it and probably order some of the other colors."
They were too small. Sent them back.
"These are cute shoes and comfortable shoes, but they're not gold they're a dark silver."
"Just as described in the description for the item. The suitcase is a nice size, not too big but it's enough space for one or two night stays on a trip. It's great. No marks, not dirty, just fresh and brand new out of the box. The packaging was not the best, but it was absolutely great. It was also delivered one day before the last date it was supposed to come to my front door. I was also able to track the package. I highly recommend to buy this luggage set. It's awesome. I love the way it rolls (perfectly), and the way it looks. It's not metal-hard on the sides, but it's hard-carpet like and has a nice texture that makes it pretty sturdy as said in the description. I absolutely love it! Great timing on the delivery too. I was so excited hearing it was home when I got back from school/band practice. Now I get to use my new luggage for the band trip I'm going on! Thank you, US Traveler! :P"
"Nice shoe but it is a little too wide, it looks weird when you put in on. Doesn't hug your feet. I am a size 10 on Dolce vita & order a 10 on this shoe"
"Absolutely love this knit top, fits perfectly and has the hard to find boat neckline. Highly recommend this knit top."
"Beautiful watch! Elegant and classy!
Love it!"
"Very Beautiful! Perfect for work , Church or after 5. Purchase this and you will not be disappointed! Ideal for a gift to that Aunt or even Mother's Day."
"This jacket is cool. I ordered a 3x because I have a larger chest and wanted to be able to close it and it is perfect. However, I have only worn it once and the sweater portion is already starting to pill. Can't really complain for 30 bucks though!"
Love 'em.  Bought for a trip to cut down on clothing.  Washable every night and dry by morning.
"This item was smaller than described; but it still fit me decently so I kept it.  After washing the shirt no longer fits me so I only got one wear out of it.  I gave four stars because I do think it was a nice shirt, wish the description would tell you to size up."
"This outfit is one of the many items I have purchase.its a beautiful outfit for church and causal wear. I bought it a little big , so my daughter can have it longer. Arrived fast aswell"
This is one heck of a nice chain!
Absolutely love these cardigans! I have multiple ones in different colors. The fabric is soft yet durable and stretchy.
"as a person that is on my feet all day everyday on solid concrete, these are awesome! smooth ride, and feel like tennis shoes."
They transform from frumpy-looking pants to very flattering ones when you put them on.  They're very comfortable too.  I love a good buy and this was one of them.  I'd like to get different colors now!
"Great running sneaker and stylish too! I've gotten a lot of compliments when I wear them for errands on the weekends, and they've been holding up when I use them for actually running as well.

They're definitely a bit on the small side though. I can wear them comfortably for a while, but by the end of the day the back of my heals is rubbed raw. In hindsight, I wish I'd ordered up half a size."
I bought these as an alternative to Brynje and Wiggy's.  I'm wearing these under a loose pair of merino wool long underwear and it keeps me comfortable.  Never too hot or too cold.  It regulates the temperature noticeably.  I haven't tried it in below freezing temps yet but they're great so far in 45F-65F temps so far.  The only thing I'm not crazy about it that the leg openings are huge.
Very beautiful umbrella! I will definitely order more.
I purchased one pair not two hope I wasn't charged for two however these earrings are beautifully crafted well balanced for their size a great addition to my Egyptian collection
Love how this fits. Plenty wide but not so it doesn't work with my pants.
"I have to say I'm glad these run small.  I have a very small foot and usually size 5 shoes don't fit.  These fit pretty well.  I have to admit they are kind of cheaply made, but they will work for a few wears.  Since the price is so low it will be okay to discard them after a few wears.  The only complaint I have is there seems to be a flaw in the shoe right above where my toes fit inside on the top and it pokes my toes.  I remedied that by putting a little padding in there and now it's fine.
I will definitely be trying some other shoes by T.U.K."
"This item is absolutely beautiful, fun, awesomely steampunk, and well made! I had read reviews and studied the size chart and ordered one XXXXL and it was too small!!! I returned the XXXXL. Yes, I'm a big person at 5'10"" and I usually wear 16-18. I'm big and athletic, not obese, and so I expected it to fit! I returned it and ordered XXXXXL. It came today and was thinking it also was too small until I discovered that I could let out the string in back and now it fits great! I love it. Beware buyers that you need to order ridiculously large!!!!!"
No complaints! Good quality sock and great gift for the avid reader in my life.
These boots are awesome! They shipped quickly. They fit perfect. I would love them in other colors!
Well made shoe laces.  Just the right length for sneakers.  I got the pink ones.
What a great deal! My daughter has worn one every day for two weeks! She's a color lover so this pack was perfect. Some of them are falling apart strait from the package but that's easy to sew up a hole. Really a great little invention. They stay on my daughter's head all day and she's one of those people with ants in their pants. Always moving!
"Pros:
*When you first put them on they're a little snug, but over time they loosen up; it's easy to slip on and off. It's a snug but not a tight fit.
*So comfortable. Better than those hard danskos!
*Cushy sole.
*I have a extra large mutated bone on my dorsal foot (an unusual bump). This part  used to rub against my dankos and would leave a bruise. NOT THESE SHOES! I

Cons:
*The shape is Not flattering. i'm not going to pick up any sexy men with these shoes.
*Sometimes they squeak but it doesn't bother me. I think that the squeaking occurs on newly waxed floors
*They scuff easily, but i personally find the worn leather look a little sexy."
"Perfect fit, outstanding quality!--in fact, they're so good I bought a second pair!!  I highly recommend these boots to my fellow riders!"
So far it fit a little larger than size
"Ho-lee-hell. The only size available was XL, and i thought i was going to have to return it... but alas, they're even a smidge too tight! For reference i'm 5'7"" with 29"" waist and 39"" hips.  The length is about 1cm too short for me, but I plan to wear this with boots in the winter, so that's ok. Material seems nice and warm. Overall, I'm happy, and glad I tried out the XL"
my 9-year-old son loves funky socks and these are super fun.
"I bought these as lake shoes and they come off too easy in the lake.
Wished I could return them, but I wore them already."
"Husband has Asics gym shoes so looked to find a golf version because his Nike's were not supportive.  Very happy with the feel of these, but wished they were a different color to go better with all this apparel."
At first glance these earrings look flimsy and plastic but looks were deceiving.  The design is beautiful and beautifully made.  My only concern now is do i wear them only for special nights or everyday wear.  What's a girl to do?
The right size the first time. Awesome trunks too.
"The best of the best. Looks good, doesn't fade. The black stays black. Love them!"
Second time I have ordered this watch. I dropped the first one and broke it after about 6 months. Loved the looks and fit of it so I ordered a new one. I will say I have a very small wrist so if you are big boned this would not be the watch for you.
No issue came on time in the original shoebox.  These shoes look good & fit well.
"This label is the most secret  label on Amazon.  Every item of clothing that I have ordered is 1st  rate, chic, comfortable and affordable. I  AM  SO PLEASED WITH  EVERY  THING.  EVERY ITEM  I've PURCHASED!  HAS BEEN 1st RATE.

I got these as an alternative to bikini bottoms for a little more coverage.  they fit perfectly and they are very slimming!!
Buttons are a little loose. Other than that its well-made. Color and fabric is good. And by good I mean good for the price.
"This hat is awesome!  Looks good with dreads, or just slouchy with regular hair.  I plan on buying other colors as well."
Great price and shipped first day of expected delivery. Fit well and look incredible.
"Why didn't I know about this dress when I was pregnant with the first!!! I'm 5'2"", currently around 160lbs, and 4 1/2 months pregnant with my second and there's still room to grow! I ordered a medium and its perfect. It's very soft stretchy fabric so that will help with continued wear as my belly grows. It's light enough you don't feel like you're going to die when your hormones kick in and you radiate heat like an oven, but still keeps you warm enough to keep the chill off. If cold, I'll throw some fleece lined leggings underneath this bad boy. It's also ideal for breastfeeding after the baby is here. You can just pull down and pop that baby on instead of having to roll down the entire top of your dress... or pulling it mostly up over your head from the bottom... horror flashbacks. Finally an affordable dress that helps the pregnant breastfeeding woman while still looking and feeling like a beauty. Just bought more."
Nice pants.  Good quality.  Look Good.
Perfect jacket for me.  It's hard just to find a regular jacket anymore.
My husband loves these & they for perfect.
"I am very pleased with this purchase. These boot s look nicer than the picture. They fit perfect, but are  best with thicker socks. I have worn them a few times already, for long stretches of time.  My feet stayed comfy and the boots did not scuff up or deteriorate. Great price for some rockin boots, thanks!"
"THis is a very comfortable night gown. I love it! I appreciate that it's v neck. It does run big. I fit in a size 8, medium tops and this is a small and I have lots of room."
"This is my second pair of Keen Sandals.  I bought the first in 2008 and they are still good except the soles are wearing a little thin - not too bad after 8 years of use.  These are great for the beach, the river or wherever you may find yourself outside.  I have worn them from coast to coast and love them.  Your toes are covered so no worries about stubbing your toes."
My baby girls looks so cute in this n l will be back!
"Good quality pajamas, beautiful color and and pattern. Well constructed and comfortable. Just voluminous and hoping it will continue to shrink with multiple washes. Size down!"
"Accurate sizing, Love! Thank you."
I recently lost 75 pounds while off work with an injury. When I was ready to go back to work I had no clothes that fit. I looked on Amazon for black ankle length slacks and these came up. I saw they could be returned easily so I tried them out. They have exceeded my expectations for slacks of this price!!! They fit great and are superb quality. I'm very active at work and these allow me to move around easily. I love them so much that I bought a second pair!!! Plus I get lots of compliments when I wear them!
"I love casual pants.  I like to be comfortable, and ordered these to try something new, and if I could buy a pair for every day of the year, I totally would!!!  and even a few extra pairs to sleep in!! these are the MOST comfortable lightweight pants I have worn!!  One thing that bugs me (only when I'm barefoot) is the elastic band on one ankle does not stay tight for some reason.  Could even be operator error somehow, but that is the only thing that could be considered a MINOR flaw."
Nice money clip. Leather/ suede section is easily removable for casual or formal use. Did not bend out of shape easily. used it for a solid 4 months straight with no issues.
Great underwear for my toddler! They Fit great with fun print. They have held up strong for 2 months now. No problems with shipping.
I wish there was a black cos it is too flashy for me but I totally love this and would get another.
I love the comfort of Melissa shoes.
Bought this for my son.  Fits beautifully and he looks great in it.
I gave it 5 stars for looks but it was very tight fitting I couldn't return it so I sent it to Goodwill..
"I've had these before, they can bunch a little not too bad. The elastic lasts a couple years."
My baby loved them.
"I bought these sneakers for boot camp class.  They are very light weight and different than other sneakers that I have owned.  Have only used them a few times, but like them so far."
They are great!  Loss of star because I didn't expect suede-ish finish and I really prefer replaceable spikes.  But they are a wonderful color that is hard to find and matches many of my shirts and hats.
"40% discount got my attention. Purchased the same shoes 6 months ago and paid much more.  There is a color variant... probably within tolerances. The most important thing is that these shoes are one the most comfortable I have ever owned, and I am 70 years old."
"Works great, but it's very messy and the holder is not a great idea."
"I must admit, based on some of the other reviews and the fact that this tuxedo was so incredibly cheap, I wasn't expecting much. I figured it would be lightweight, maybe un-lined, and just barely presentable enough to wear to a formal affair. Boy, was I mistaken! It's a full blown tux, fully lined, and  just as good in quality as any other suit I own. And it fits me PERFECTLY. The only alteration I'll need is to hem the pants (they come unhemmed). I'm 6'1"" but there's plenty of extra length/material in the unhemmed pant legs that I'll bet they would even accommodate someone much taller than I am. I'm so pleased with this purchase. Wow."
Here I ordered one size up based on reviews and it is both beautiful and fits well.  Like the sleeve detail and adds a very nice touch to an evening dress I own.
these were purchased for my son -- he is a waiter for the summer-- they fit well and look nice-- after washing them a bunch of times-- still look great!
Bought it for my son who is in a wheelchair. It fits perfect.
Happy little customer. She loved how  bright the colors were and the shoes fit as expected
This shoes are just as pictured! Perfect for my tiny dancer!
"The pockets in these jeans are legit. 5'11"" 220lb 48"" hips and size 18 was perfect. They stretch quite a bit, so a belt is required, but they are so cute and they wash very well!"
"I got this bag for my school books and work. It had held together very well. I've had it for about a year and it's still working. Granted, I don't go camping with it. It began to unthread recently at the from pocket, but that's an easy fix(I was a boy scout). Good bag for the price!"
"Would have gotten 5 stars except tight in the sleeves and no, I'm not fat."
it holds you so good ... sweat a bit to put it on but it feels so good on ur skin I'm going 2 get more .... wish it was on sale though its a bit more that I usually spend but there is not regret
"Great costume for $50

- Fits nicely
- good material.
- Looks great
- Comfortable

- Can be warm after a little while."
It was a gift for my grand-niece.  It is something my sister says to her all the time.  And my sister said my niece loved it and it was actually prettier than the pictures showed that it was.
"I've had these boots for 2 weeks now and so far I love them.  They are very warm.  I live outside of Chicago and we are going on our 3rd straight week of nights with single digit temps and below zero wind chill.  I have to walk the dogs at night and so far my feet have stayed warm and dry.  The toe box had enough room that my toes can wiggle and I have good circulation which keeps them warmer than too tight boots.  I have large calves but since these lace I have plenty of room even with my jeans tucked in.  I'm 5'1"" and so these come mid calf on me and I've had no problems with snow getting in.  The faux fur top is a nice touch and they don't look too 'cluncky' on me.  I haven't had any problems with water leaking in but we haven't had any wet puddles or melt snow yet so I'll have edit my review later if I find an issue.  The boot is flexible enough that walking is easy.  Good traction on icy patches and packed snow.  Overall, I would definitely recommend these."
They didn't seem to be a wide. They were tight to start but as the evening wore on they stretched a bit and were actually pretty comfortable. Especially since I haven't worn heels in ages.
This does fit loosely but I bought these for my son who works in the ER. He wears shirts under them so they needed to be loose. He has been buying all kinds of scrubs for years and he thinks these are the absolute best and hold up well to the daily washings.
"Fit great, were a hit at softball"
"Delivered on time,  love the watch. Awesome buy."
Attractive.  Like it very much
Bought this shoulder bag for my husband. The cognac venetian color was exactly as displayed. The craftsmanship of the leather bag is beyond it's description. Also bought the leather checkbook and ID case to match.  Very handsome pieces for a man to carry and expensive looking.
"A bit large and the color definitely isn't the color of the pictures, but it is great anyway. Dickie always make great pants and will keep buying though I'll be more careful about the colors in the future"
"I am petite and always worry about the socks being too long, but, these fit perfect.  Plus the two different patterns add a nice touch to basic black.  Would highly recommend."
"Got this for a present for my teenage daughter. It runs a bit big but that's how she liked it. Not so big that it looked bad, just baggy. I have a feeling once I wash it a few times it might shrink up. Super cozy and warm"
"Good quality, pretty, perfect length. I have no complaints at all. This chain is perfect and I would buy more if I needed to. Much prettier than I expected."
"I love the style, my number one favorite cargo shorts, it fit kind of small however."
Decent...does fit Pebble ver 1.  The color does kind of rub off and make some parts of the band shiney.
My husband really likes these shoes. He has a bunyon and after a few days the material stretched enough so they are comfortable. They look nice on as casual or when he goes to work. Great shoe.
"This is my favorite bra ever! I am very sensitive and can't wear wired bras. This bra provides enough support without any wires and is very comfortable. I am so happy that I found it. For now, I own it in black, white, and butterscotch color. I will buy more."
"These fit great, were comfortable, and match everything.  I do however put a pair of inserts in all my flats since nothing fashionable is at all good for your foot.  I love these!"
Bought this for my daughter she really likes it.
"I love this! I wore it a bunch this usmmer, the clas does come undone easily so I ended up sewing it to stay!"
Ordered these a half size up like the reviews recommended.  At first it took a little getting used to having room at the front but once I worked out in them a little more they turned out to be the perfect fit.  I love the color and I feel very supported when doing my workouts.
"These are soft socks that feel light on my feet even in summer time heat. They stay up on my leg, wonderful to find the navy color. Can't find them in stores."
"The perfect belt! Looks great, perfect fit. Great value!"
This works so well. Never get your face bitten by the wind again!
"Another great Everest bag. We gave as gifts to our grown girls. They were pleased with the usefulness of this all purpose utility bag. We have several Everest product and find them to be a quality, value & Recommended Purchase."
"Nice shoe for the price. I bought it for my son to wear for rare occasions he needs to wear formal shoes, so I am not concerned about the durability, though they do seem very well made."
The Happy Lens is a game changer!
"Stylish, functional wallet that is easy to clean!

I've been using this wallet since December and I absolutely love it!

It is easy to clean has plenty of credit card slots and a special one to protect from Rfids that steal your cc information. Only thing I wish it has was a special place for your license, but I place it with the other credit cards. It has two areas that I use one for receipts and one for cash, as well as, a zippered area for change."
My 12 year old son has a slight arch that has started to collapse.  I thought he'd cry when the podiatrist told us no flip-flops this summer.  I am extremely thankful to find this very supportive shoe.  It's worth every penny!!
"Like they do not move around, ending up with heel on top of your foot!"
no arch support in them..  I love them have 3 different colors because I wear them when I go out because they are so comfortable and soft.
"I love these pants!!!! Going to get another pair. Very good quality.
and comes our perfect after washing and drying for a few times."
Fit perfectly and we're exactly what we needed and the price was great very pleased !
"buy for my wife,she  love it."
These are full length for me.  I do like them but they are a little loose in the legs.
Beautiful ring with delicate intricate design. Delivered quickly. Happy with my purchase :)
Not too thin just right. Good quality. Fits perfect.
nice but heavy good quality
"These seem to be really good slippers, thick solid leather.....however. When my son tried them on - he got his toes into them and that was it."
This is the best running/workout watch I've used.  (I used a Nike Triax one previously.)  I have used it to train for a half marathon and use it on all of my runs.  It's quite easy to figure out how to use it.  I don't really use the FLIX capabilities.  The buttons are easy to press.  The face is very readable while running because of the large face.  The indiglo works great when you are running at night.  The synthetic rubber band material is sturdy without feeling too stiff.  The memory holds your previous workouts including the date which is a nice bonus if you need to transfer the info to on an online log and you don't have a chance to do it right away.
"Remarkable value for sturdy, warm sweat suit set.  The construction appears sturdy, and the fleece lining is cozy.  It's a win-win."
"Takes the guesswork out of tying ties!
Great quality. Fast service. Will recommend to anyone."
"As someone else posted, it's a pretty stiff bag - since I was looking for a ""formed"" bag, it suited my needs. I've only used it once, but got a lot of compliments on it. What I love is that it holds so much!! I had my headphone case, my phone, my wallet (not a small one, either!), lipsticks, a mirror... everything I would normally put in my ""work"" backpack. And everything fit wonderfully. Looking forward to seeing how it holds up over time (and will be back to update my review should it not)."
"It was a gift for my sister, and she loved it. Product looked as it was expected."
It's cute but see through. worth the money
my head has never been bluer
"Need to wear a bit more to stretch these out. They are beautiful,  I would order a half size up."
"Perfect slip-on for casual wear. If you're not expecting a crazy level of durability and arch support, they're a great alternative to more expensive brands like Vans or generic ""prison style"" deck shoes. Very reasonably priced and with a more low-profile look than typical slip-on sneakers, with a more slip-resistant sole than Vans or generic deck shoes. Pretty much exactly what I'd expected. I'll definitely be buying these as long as they're manufactured."
These fit great! A little longer and they don't lose their shape! Going to order more for my son
"I bought this as an Amazon daily deal of $59. This is an outstanding deal for that price. The coat is not as heavy as I expected, but is perfect for driving. Even the buttons are positioned so that wearing it in the car is easy."
"I took this on a weekend trip and used it as a pool bag. It is very pretty, seems study enough and was very useful. Lots of room for everything I needed for a day at the pool."
"Very comfortable, free range of movement. If only Amazon has the short in this without buying the matching top..."
I've worn several models from this line from Merrell. Haven't had a bad pair yet.
"This is a really pretty pearl pendant. I was hoping the mounting that  holds the pearl on the chain would be more substantial. It is very thin. Otherwise, the pearl is a nice size and has a nice color and luster."
I love it. My daughter  loves it too! I'm a 12 and ordered an x large and it is roomy but super comfy. Wish there were more colors. So ooh cute.
Nice quality outfit..love it
Excellent product light weight
"My husband loved this ring, its not cheap made at all! This ring is very large and MAN MAN looking, Ifg you guy is the biker type this is for him!"
This is by far the most comfortable underwear. All cotton. Cuff leg (no elastic) doesn't bind the legs. Long cut means no wedgies. The only defect is that they wear out after about 2 years. And they are so hard to find in the stores--I am so glad I was able to find this product on Amazon!
"I bought this for mi wife as a present to match with my own Skagen, i love these watches for their design and material. They fit perfectly when wearing any formal Shirt and jacket. It looks and feels awesome with any formal attire in both Women and Men."
I like this shoe. Great arch support.
Very nice quality! So adorable and cannot wait to wear!!
Gorgeous colors-soft cotton that washes w/o too much wrinkling.
"This is such a cute set. I wear it a lot and get tons of compliments! It adds a cool southwestern vibe to any outfit. It's not so overdone or large that it looks gaudy, but it's large enough to stand out more than your regular pendant necklace. The necklace lays beautiful (the stones don't get twisted around or anything like that), and the earrings are super cute - not too large, not too small."
These are beautiful and very comfortable! I got lots of compliments!
"This is the blouse and color that I have needed,,great purchase!"
Cute but the toe box was a little too tight so I returned.
"Necklace arrived in a gift box, and is as pictured. Overall, very pretty-- purchased four of these for a family event. Three for family members and one for myself, to mark a major event for us! They were very well received. The pendant itself is dainty and delicate, which is fine. The chain is only 18"" long and delicate as well. Will probably wear with a longer chain that I already have and swap pendants just because I don't like necklaces too close to my neck. For me, this is fine to wear for a casual outfit on an occasional basis; definitely not for everyday. This met my expectations."
"a bit too wide, but I really need a narrow, so I just wear thick socks. Pretty boots  - boho style  that looks great with skinny jeans! Leather is very soft and easy stained, but I mink oil them and they darken and the spots don't show as much. Great lower heel!"
"You cant beat the price, really!!! It has a long chain. The kids cant wait to wear it to school."
My 7 year old son loves it! Good quality.
"Arrived in two weeks. As other reviewers said, topnis a bit large, but easily adjusted."
"The HAT did the trick.!  This octogenarian needed class & protection at 4/2 Yankee & Pirate baseball game. Made wheelchair arrangements,
Got the HAT & had a great time.  Thanks San Diego -"
Keen the only shoe to own
I'm a bit lopsided and the shaped cup helps hide that. It's true to size in a size I can't find very often.
This is a great buy for this style shirt.
I seldom write reviews because I'm not easy to please but this bag is awesome!!! I like to be organized and this bag has plenty of compartments and all of them are secured with zippers. There's a lanyard in the main compartment with a hook for my keys so I don't have to dig around to find them. My cell phone fits nicely in the front zipper compartment so it's secure yet easy to access. I have no complaints about this bag. It was well thought out and I love the color.
"This sweat pants is exactly what I expected... it is thinner than other brands, but it performs as good if not better!
I wear it for morning walk or just around the house... it's super comfy and I've ordered a different color already!

I'm 5'8"" with 33"" waist and Medium size was perfect!"
Very nice.  Very pretty. Can't say how it works as have not been able to find out how to change the battery. Thought it was a manual wind.
Great scarf! Looks nice with my khaki rain slicker.
"Awesome shoes. Had them in black. Loved them so much found them in camo as well. Great fit. Nice leather, hugs foot well, not too tight. Lots of compliments. Nice rubber pad on sole of shoe. Really comfortable to walk in!"
This was a perfect accessory to entertain the residents of the nursing home.  It's great!
"Looks better than I thought and it does have a fair amount of room in the waist , my daughter loves the design"
"Very good, very close, is thin"
"Great watch, power reserve is about one day. This watch is definitely an eye catcher, good size and weight to it as well"
"Great fit . very comfortable does not cling. Fits great. I'm 5'1"" just covers my knees. Love love."
Cute & dainty. Very lightweight not tight. I like them best with the gathered section at back of head & widest section at front of head.  Stays better & looks cuter.
"I bought the 130 (5/6) for my 40 pound 4 year old. She wears between a 4t and 5t so I would say the sizing is pretty accurate as she will definitely be able to wear this dress for a while.
As you see from the pictures it's an adorable dress. The belt is separate and can be used with other outfits as well. The length is great at just below the knee with a layered look. It's casual enough to be an every day look or dressy enough to go somewhere nice. The material is light enough that it can be worn on a hot summer day without overhearing. I would definitely recommend this dress. It's seriously too cute! My daughter twirled in it for the first 10 minutes she had it on because she felt so pretty.
I was given this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. Everything written is completely honest and my own thoughts on the product."
"Perfect fit, comfort and look!"
I bought two of these to stack. Comfortable fit and worked perfectly with a Balinese bracelet I own.
Great fit. Exactly as pictured. Soft material
These are awesome..like walking on a cloud. So comfortable while being so [uneek]... a perfect summer sandal
Length is spot on.. the width was off.. I normally wear a D width.. these seem tight.
The fit is perfect (Im a size 8) and its very comfortable. Bonus- he loves it!
"I love these shoes. Really didn't expect them to be so comfortable. I have been wearing them every single day since they arrived. No shoe bites and no discomfort.
I always wear a size 6 and i bought the same and it fit perfectly. Will buy more in different colors now!"
"I found these shoes in a store but they didn't have my size so when I found it on Amazon, in my size, I jumped on them AND they were $32.00 less on Amazon than they were in the store.
These are my 'go to sandals' for the summer. Cushy, comfortable and look good all at once!"
"Absolutely LOVE these flip-flops. Purchased them specifically for wearing in the campground bathhouses, but they're perfect for the pool as well."
"I love these leggings!  The colors are great, size was what I expected, and delivery was fast.  They feel super soft and smooth too!"
"True to the prior reviews, this swimdress runs a little small. I typically wear a XXL but bought a 4XL and it fits great! Super flattering and covers the tummy problem area. If there were different color options than navy and black combos I would buy more. The thickness of the fabric is good and is made from quality material. All in all I'm very happy with my purchase!"
"First off these pants are AWESOME!!! I love the way the feel. The cotton has a nice texture to it but not rough. The colors are beautiful and natural and subdued. Now when they say one size fits most, they mean folks on the short, slender side. I'm 5'3"" and wear a small in everything. Size wise they are just slightly roomy but they would not accomidate the curvier ladies. They are also very short pants, they are about five inches above my ankles. I'm by no means a tall gal and they kinda fit like highwaters on me! The length doesn't bother me but if you are 5'4""and taller, these will fit more or less like capris. They have these gorgeous but very fragile(I stepped on and broke a button each of the pairs I got!) coin like buttons and bells sown within them. I will probably remove the bells though, the idea is enchanting but I'm sure it will become annoying to me real quickly! I reccomend these pants to a smaller, short built person to achieve the look shown. I haven't washed them yet but I would assume they would need to be gently hand washed to preserve the buttons and bells."
"It's simple, tried many shoes, these are simply the best for the money. Light! Great Support! Quality built and fit like a glove!"
"I purchased brown a few months ago...very comfortable and you can wear them all day.  I wear 9 1/2 -10, bought 10 on first pair and returned for a 9.  Will purchase more in multi colors."
Super cute with skinny jeans and comfortable.
This is the skirt my wife will use to be a mermaid for Halloween. She loves it.
Love the color. Fits fine. Want some in different colors now!
Perfect for pocket and cards
AS DESCRIBED. VERY GOOD MATERIAL.  SOFT AND LOVELY LIL OUTFIT.
"Great watch. Well made and easy to use
Highly recommend"
"I bought this to wear on our (first) Caribbean cruise.  I wanted something that had a drawstring (since it can be windy when the ship is at sea and on excursion), and was breathable, and packable.  This is all of those things.  There is a drawstring in the back of the hat that allows you to adjust the size.  I also like that it is SPF 50, since I'm a redhead & burn easily.  This hat is very good quality at a great price.  I have not washed it yet, but when it's dirty, I'll throw it into a lingerie bag & throw it into the washer.  Very pleased with this hat."
Christmas present that he picked out himself seems to be good quality will see if they stand the test of time but just like pictured and arrived on time
"LOVE THIS BRA!! No pinching, binding, rubbing from the band. Hope they never stop making this one!! Only 4 stars because it does stretch out rather quickly. It's not a deal breaker for me as I just tweak it on my sewing machine after it stretches past the last set of hooks."
I usually wear an 8 1/2 but these fun a little small so had to return them for a 9.  Very comfortable and a great shoe especially for the price.  Highly recommend.
they fit as expected. it was easy
This handbag was really nicely made and extremely good value.
"The material is thin so this would be good for sweaty work-outs. If you are worried about your nipples ""showing"" you may want to steer away."
Color so so in person
"I got a pair in black and they are by FAR one of my favorite more casual shoes to wear with just about anything...jeans, khakis, whatever. LOVE them."
Absolutely beautiful purse! Amazing quality for the price! I love it.
Great fit! I wore these in the field recently for 2 weeks straight. I didn't get a chance to break them in before hand and that wasn't a problem. They were comfortable and my feet didn't hurt or get blisters at all! I would definitely recommend these!
"I love the looks on this clips and to have all three colors at the reach of my hand for the same price was excellent for me. NOTE. This are for regular ties, NOT SLIM TIES. Because it will fit too long on slim ones."
Very nice bag. Good quality for the price.
would not order again
love this purse.
I like the shoes.  Love the gray color.
More HK to add to my growing list of collectables. Large enuf to always find in my purse.
"Love it! I usually wear 8-10 in dresses and ordered a L. Fits well, feels great!"
"I purchased these big based on reviews but they were really big. My daughter is toddler 6-7 so I purchased an 8. They are pretty big but I can sinch them down with drawstring so they fit her. I'm glad she will have plenty of room to grow. We haven't used them for dance class yet.

update: They were adorable for dance class but they were very slippery on the dance studio floor. Compared to other kids who had Bloch solid black ballet slippers that had a lot more grip."
the Color/ Size meets the discription. My daughter got this bag for light school work with a little bit of style. She loves it! It goes with just about anything and it's lightweight. Will purchase other colors. The shipment was within 2 days of ordering. I have Amazon Prime though. Hope this helps.
"Got this for someone as a gift, and they loved it.  It is very pretty and sparkly and appears to be good quality.  I wouldn't mind having one for myself.  It's also pretty unique compared to other circle type jewelry I've seen out there."
BEAUTIFUL! So excited to wear them. Great quality.
"Since I discovered Scarleton bags on Amazon, they are my new go-to purses. I usually buy my bags in places like Urban Outfitters, with an occasional splurge on something that is real leather, but for the most part I want a faux leather bag that is inexpensive, looks real, that is soft and stylish without a lot of hardware or decoration, that goes with everything and comes in colors besides just brown or black! This hobo bag is gorgeous with a capital G! I ordered the burgundy, which was more red than burgundy so I sent it back. I got a similar one instead, in a soft gray, and I ended up with this hobo in beige. They are pretty large purses, but I love large bags. More inside pockets would be a treat, but most large bags don't have them anyway and that's easily fixed with a purse organizer. You won't be disappointed with these bags."
Bought these for my 20 year old college student. He says they feel great and he likes the way they look.  He is very picky.
"I have a couple invictas,but this one is my favorite."
Nice t-shirt. Love the fabric that it is made of. Hubby really likes it.
A little long in length but okay.  Nice feel.  Good quality. Comfortable!
Love it! It's more beautiful in person.
Form fitting keeps hands warm.
"Love these sexy shoes, they make my but look great. And when my legs are over my head it makes me feel sexxy"
I love these. They are so warm and adorable. I can wear thick socks w them. Size is true to size maybe even a little big. Def don't go up a size for socks to fit. You won't need to.
"I love these shoes. They just fit a smidge too small. And not the ""I'll be okay for a day in too small shoes,"" it was a ""I can't even wear these around the house too small."" I have normally width feet, and wear a 9.5 in every other high heel out there.. just not this one. But the shipping was fast, the shoe is beautiful - the gray is slightly varigated, not a solid gray, so the dimension that added was a pleasant surprise."
Absolutely love this shoe!  My second pair.  Extremely comfortable.  I have a bad back and bad knees and I can wear this shoe all day and not feel bad.  Very cushiony.  Don't hesitate to purchase it.
"i wear it for yard work. The tail is a bit short for me, what with bending over and stuff. But...it suits the purpose"
You should definitely order 1 size smaller than your size. This is a loose fit shirt
"Very comfortable, sharp looking shoes."
Very nice casual top.
These pants last a very long time. Worth the investment.
I read the previous reviews on this shirt and I decided to order 2 sizes up. That was a good idea because it fits perfectly. I'm a XL and I ordered a XXXL. Make sure not to tumble dry let it air dry.
Nice style. Definitely need to order a size or two below your normal size. Quick delivery.
My husband loves these shoes.  There is no breaking in and so comfortable you don't even know you're wearing them.
"After trying several different brands of cargo pants,I finally found some that fit properly. Every other brand I tried was way to tight in the crotch. I must have returned  different brands to Amazon and tried at least that many more at various stores in the area. These fit like they should. The only complaint I can make is that they are a little too wide in the leg. I can live with that as li g as hey are comfortable when I sit down."
"These run a tad narrow, not like the Z/1 style that runs VERY narrow.  I love them."
I've had my eye on this suite since last summer! I ordered a Med. I think  that is a 4-6? Honestly I could have ordered a small. It still fits great just a tad big. I weigh 125-127 I'm 5'2  I normally a sz 4 USA.  It's super cute and I can't wait to wear it on our cruise next month! *Update. So I got a ton of compliments on my cruise.  I should have exchanged the Med for a small. It was too big. (My fault not the companies.  I'll order a small for summer.
Worked perfectly for making a tutu princess dress.
received quickly -  item as expected.
"I love Clarks! My feet are so happy! The bendables line is perfect fit and support! And they last for years! My first pair of Clarks sandals were bought 2 years ago, and they are still going strong!"
"My boyfriend is follically challenged and fair skinned, not wearing a hat in summer is not an option. This is the third one of these hats he's owned. He's gone through three, not because they're poorly made, but because he tends to loose them; if he were able to go through a summer without losing one (or two), I'm sure we'd report that they hold up quite nicely.

The hat itself runs a bit large. Boyfriend has a large head (his description, not mine) and is always shocked that the small/medium fits so well. Maybe if you have a lot of hair, it would feel snug, but to me it seems like most people would fit into the small/medium.

Bottom line: Great hat, great price"
These serve the purpose as dog park foot wear. I don't get sand and dirt all over my legs. They would not do for long wals as there is no support.
I have a special need for these and they are perfect.  I use these as house shoes primarily but have worn them out.  Nice quality leather and comfortable from the first wearing.
Love this zip up!! It's well constructed and durable. It's warm without being bulky. I heeded other reviews and ordered a size larger as it does run a little small. Would definitely order again!
Awesome hat!! Fit perfectly..
"These are really great quality.  Wearing flip-flops can make you feel sloppy, but these make you feel kind of put together.  Very thick soles give you a spring and the good leather uppers are unusually nice looking."
These are my favorite running shoe.  Unfortunately they only last me about 350-400 miles.
"I love this bag. I prefer to have a backpack type purse so I can keep my hands free while walking or shopping. Also, I don't care for leather bags. I had a hard time finding backpack purses in the stores, then I looked online and found a number of bags to choose from. I'm really happy I found this bag. I find the bag to be very well made and holding up surprisingly well under the punishment I put it through. I have had the Get Out of Town Bag (in green) for over a year and it still looks very good - and I'm pretty rough on a purse. I love that the pockets with snaps automatically snap closed without me having to work at it. I think the hardware on the bag is sturdy and attractive. As some other reviewers have noted the straps are not adjustable; however, I am almost 5'8 tall and the bag sits comfortably on my back. I am now going to purchase the black Get Out of Town Bagg because I have liked my existing green one so much."
Looks good - Fits well  15 yr old son loves them
My husband wears this all the time
Nice and soft. Thick enough to feel curvy yet comfortable.
"I got this to polish the edges of my boots and the parts I can't spit shine. This stuff works great - really shines! I still prefer Parade Gloss, though."
"This was a gift for my mother.  She loves them.  They look very nice.  They aren't very sparkly, but are lovely."
Perfect fit. Cool and  breathable.
Nice fit and was very warm.
Found a present for my Mom she doesn't want to take back! YAY!
"Fits well, hugs the top, flairs at the belly. Comfortable. The fabric is like a knit t-shirt. That may be good or not, according to what you're looking for. I would have liked it to be a little heavier weight."
My son loves his morph suit. Exactly as described. Fit perfectly and hasn't torn so I'm very happy with the purchase.
I liked it a lot. Shipped super fast
"Nice boots, they are a little tough to get off but it's not a show stopper. The sole is nice and i feel safe on the snow and ice."
"I love my dawgs! This is my third pair, and I will be buying more in the future."
Whats not to love about purple toe socks? I have had these for some time and they are holding up well. No visible damage and the elastic parts are still tight. Highly recommend these
Bought 4 pairs for my son. These are his favorite shorts! He loves the fit and comfort of this brand and the price and size selection on Amazon is unbeatable!!
"I like this shirt, and bought it to wear for a church function.  I am a petite woman, and thought it would look slim cut like the picture, so I purchased a medium, but it is actually a regular looking t-shirt, kind of boxy... I washed it in hot water and it did shrink a bit for me.... I will still wear it, but note: it isn't made like this picture."
"Had to get links taken out of band, but it was worth it. Great watch. Thanks"
"I like it but it's too small for my fat ass. I can get it on but it looks awful. Not the skirts' fault, tho. Got the XL and I'm around 175-ish. It's too tight in the waist. The fabric is a bit rough, not soft. If I lose weight I will wear it."
Order the same size every time and they fit the same everytime.
The best socks in the world!!
I bought these for my sister and she was very happy.  She's a bit of a clutz(sp?) and was surprised that they worked and she didn't slip when she took her dog for a walk on icy/crusty snow.
"What could be better than a Curious George shirt for a 3-year olds birthday party? It fit true to size, and my son loved it."
perfect for my bob ross costume
"The stitches were a little off and it arrived bunched up with quite a few wrinkles. It looked good for the costume I was using it for though, and it fit really well. The top was a little small, so if you're larger chested you may want to go up a size."
"Bought this as a present. The picture makes it look like the tie bar is sort of chrome with a silver stripe in the middle, but that's just the lighting/glare. Overall, a nice product though."
good buy nice gloves
Love nine west shore  comfortable make me look so sexy love it.
"A staff t-shirt- just what any fan would want! Now you too, can join the staff at the park. Display this proudly, you work with the dinosaurs!"
"I worried these would be too small and I ordered a size up as most of the reviews suggested. They fit fine and I think I would've been okay if I'd ordered my usual size. They are adorable, and I ended buying a pair in every color."
"It was a good gift and very durable.
It was packed in a way that was easy to forward on."
"good quality - quick shipping, will order again!"
"Loved this costume. It was better then I expected. I read a couple negative reviews about it, but it fit me well and it was comfortable and so sexy! Totally recommend it!"
THESE LOOK GREAT .THIE SHOE FITS VERY WELL. WILL WOW YOU WHEN YOU SEE THEM.
"I am really happy with these earrings - very light weight, well made, well matched stones and they look great with my smoky quartz ring!"
"My son loves Nemo, and every time he gets dressed in this soft and lightweight set he gets so happy! I was happy as well with the price (bought on sale), quality, and size!"
Beautiful bargain!
"The face of the watch is a beautiful black sparkle that looks like the trends in the really expensive watches. I've gotten tons of complements on this watch. The band is super comfortable and fits my wrist very well. Keeps time right on the dot without any problems. I didn't expect to get such a nice watch for such a low price, every girl loves a bargain and I really like wearing this."
"Get a pair of these.  Yes, they are sort of shiny when they stretch, but legging aren't exactly formal wear.  They are so comfortable and last for years.  I just replaced my last pair, which lasted for four years as my only pair (worn 2 or 3 times a week in the winter).  I'd buy more, but really, I only need this one pair.  Letting them line-dry helps to preserve color and shape, but I don't always have time for that."
"I am addicted to Invicta watches - this is my 4th!  I love the shape and the blue numbers.  No day, date, stopwatch - just tells time!"
Love these pants. Warm and soft.  Just ordered another pair
"This is a very nice shirt. Well made and not a thin fabric. It is a tighter fitting shirt and will fit right up against your skin so if you are looking for a roomier shirt, don't get this one."
My favorite type of atoms by far! Fit great!
"Helps cool me off on HOT days!  The water evaporates rather quickly, but it is easy to rewet it.  I like that it isn't bulky.  I have not chilled it in the refrigerator.  Works fine with just cold water.  Good price."
Amazing! Im a huge fan of the show Vikings and all Nordic culture. This is a standout piece and exactly as described. Super fast shipping from the UK to here in the US. Faster than some of my domestic purchases! I highly recommend the item and these sellers!
"I love it! However, it is a longer top. Be prepared for it to hang over your shorts a bit."
"Beautiful, silky stockings - these are the most comfortable stockings I own.  They do not dig into my thighs and they look very flattering on, and the lace at the top is so soft and silky.  They do not have the rubber grips, but they still stay up and don't have the problem of rolling down as the stockings with the rubber grips do.  I wear these in the house and have not worn them out - I think I might wear garter belts to make sure they don't slide down while I walk, but for indoor fun, they stay up and do the trick!  I got the purple and black pack and the purple is a deep beautiful royal purple."
"I have great difficulty finding comfortable casual shoes that are wide enough and offer sufficient arch support, particularly in a house shoe that I can slip on and off easily.  Crocs fill the bill!"
"Thinner that I would have like, but overall I have no complaints."
LOVE IT!  They fit absolutely perfect exactly what I expected! They fit  amazingly I am always worried when buying stuff online when it comes to pants but the fit is GREAT!!! I am buying all of them HAHAHAHAHAH!
"Wonderful shoe, dressy and the pretty straps would give some protection from cool weather between the car to inside, But the size 6 doesn't fit for me. It is a 6A or AA or AAA, and due to the solid strap across the toes, is non adjustable if you don't have pointy toes,  I exchanged it for a 7-1/2.  Hope it fits.  I Love Amazon's no cost refund policy. Otherwise I don't think I would take a chance on mail-order shoes and things."
Very cute and comfortable heels. I love the multi color that i can wear with many things. Its is natural suede and the price was unreal for such great quality.
"Durable, lightweight, perfect for your little one."
"Since the last time I post a comment here, other websites copy my post and paste it to there own store site which make me angry. Since then, I never left a comment again to amazon.
But for some reason, I am writing here again to explain how good this product fit onto me.
Wear good, looks great, feels awesome, right length as expected, and best of all much cheaper if you compare the pricing to other local stores.
But be alert when buying, you never never know when they gonna lower the price or make it soo expensive to buy."
"Love my watch.  I've been a fan of this classic look for 30+ years.  Simple, clean lines.  Leather strap.  The only thing that could make it better would be a red second hand!"
"Comfortable shoes, can wear all day. If you need wide shoes then these will be a little uncomfortable."
nice but a bit small for the price
It is sticks together great.  The elastic strap that the watch goes on is great. I was worried that my Timex Iron Man would not fit/to small but the new band fit the small Timex.  Loved it.
Love these shoes - the heel is just a little high for me to wear and walk all day long.  But still love them!
"Item is perfect for what I need, the fit of the shirt is good. I wear a size L-XL in my shirts and I purchased this shirt in XL and I'm glad I did, a L would have been too snug. I know after 1 wash this shirt will not fit, but for 1 night I can wear it. The price was perfect. Getting some red lipstick to coordinate."
I love my Mary Jane. My size didn't fit but the larger size did fit and they are so classy and original. A must buy and great appeal.
The tank top is well made and comfortable.  Love it.
I have had so many complements that they love my shoes. I love them. I will not use them at all. I would  like to return them.
"Quite comfortable.  I got these because I love my Chaco sandals and wanted some closed shoes for walking in the city.  These are super comfortable.  You may want to wear them with socks for a few days to break them in, then you can go barefoot in comfort after that.  They are cute and I love them!"
"Keens are great because kids run.  We use keens as an alternative to crocs and flip flops.  While I love both crocs and flip flops; running in them leads to falls.  Keens are great for running, climbing, splashing and they do not trip up my kiddos.

I love love love the purple color of these as did my girlie girl.  She has slightly wide feet, but these fit her well and she always asks to wear them.  They look cute with shorts too."
"I purchased a 5.11 bag for my husband 10 years ago!! The old one is still holding up. No rips or tears. It can hold weight. This includes his belt and accessories ( which you know is heavy all together).  I only purchased this new one simply because the old one looks faded and run down.

This new bag is heavy duty, thick, and can support all of your gear.  Its the perfect size to haul it from your vehicle to your work vehicle repeatedly! It can take a beating. It has a support for the bottom of the bag, removable walls, and heavy duty velcro inside.
What he loves about this bag also is that the padding for the strap is made of a high quality rubber , right where it would sit on your shoulder. It prevents the bag from slipping off your shoulder.  It also has velcro on the top for a velcro patch but the patch isn't included.  I absolutely recommend this for the rough goers that might go threw alot of bags because this one holds up and absolutely does NOT look cheap!!"
"I don't wear them all of the time, but I've had these for 4 years now and they're still fantastic. Regular care makes them look almost brand-new again. I use saddle soap and Sno-Seal and they look great."
Super cute! Nice wide fit!
love this necklace and wear it all the time.  I want to buy another with larger beads.
"These shoes were ok,  just didn't look as bright as the pic. I returned them."
"Fits great.  I'm tall- 5'10, 190 pounds and it fit great."
"Overall an excellent watch if you are looking for something simple, stylish and inexpensive.

The body feels weighty and solid, the face a bit larger than I prefer (and I'm a big guy, 6'2"").  I like the white dial with large Arabic numerals, easier for older eyes to read in most any light.  On the face it says 'Railroad Approved', who knows what that means.. probably nothing.  The wristband straps are very comfortable.  I settled on one color and won't bother changing it unless it breaks, but they appear to be well made.  The watch and spare bands arrived in a simple flattish folding case.. unless you store your watch there it's useless unless you re-purpose it into a gadget box or something."
"Nice quality, great price, perfect for prom"
"Very nice wallet, for a great price! It's a real shame we have to buy special scanner blocking wallets to protect our ID these days! This wallet is really nice, and has many compartments & nice leather. I definitely recommend!"
Great fit!! Love the shirt
Softest
"I bought these shoes for my husband and he absolutely loves them. He is using them to train and run in all surfaces, although he's been running more in the street lately. Very comfortable, good for long hours of use, light weighted, excelent quality, great grip on humid and wet surfaces. Easy to wear and tie."
"Super cute, fits great and lightweight. Easily scrunches up in your purse or glovebox for easy rain use."
"Can not beat these suits for the price!! They are very high quality and come packaged as such, wrapped in plastic inside a garment bag.  The pants obviously have to be altered, but even with alterations this suit is less than $100 and well worth it!"
I am thrilled with the short amount of time it took to receive these socks. My daughter will be so happy when she opens this as a gift on Christmas.
Super cute made of heavier weight metal so it doesn't feel cheap
"This is a wonderful sweater.  I am wearing it as I type,  The fabric is soft and comfortable and falls in a flattering manner.  It really does resemble cashmere.  I am very glad to own it."
"Caterpillar footwear has always been on 'top of the line' of work footwear and this hiker shoe is absolutely in that category. What's really nice about this shoe is they are very comfortable and not heavy as many hikers can be, and with the new anti-slip sole (trust me - I tested them on wet ice and the slippage was almost none existent), my purchase was well worth it. If you ever slipped on ice, you know how bad that feels, wearing these so far has prevented me from slipping. The shoe is also good looking and doesn't look like you are wearing heavy winter boots."
"I was skeptical about how these leggings should fit because they are so inexpensive. But I decided it was worth a try because they are such a bargain. I am 5 foot 9, have long legs and usually wear size XL or 14 in pants. These leggings actually stretched to fit. I was so happy. The fabric feels nice and sturdy and not flimsy. They do not feel like fleece, more like spandex on the outside but with a soft fuzzy lining, a bit thicker  and softer than most leggings I have worn.  They do not feel overly thick, but just soft and comfortable. The colors are so nice and neutral. will go with lots of outfits, and you get 6 different colors, wow! They are comfortable and very soft. The length goes down to  just above the ankle on my long legs.  I think they would fit many different sized people because they have a lot of stretch if needed, or if not, they would still fit nicely.
i highly recommend these, they are very good quality and a great value."
"The first bathing suit was too small, so I ordered a larger size and it was fine. I'm a smaller framed girl in comparison of my cup size, so it's very challenging to find bath suits that fit, top and bottom. Very comfortable and I'm very happy with it."
I brought this swimsuit for my mom and she loves it! She's taking it on her cruise to with her. I'll post a picture when she comes back!
good for the money.  stylish too.
"These jeans always fit well, look good, and last a long time.  I wear a pair of these almost every day."
"Christmas present for the girlfriend who is a big Xmas Vacation fan.  She liked it.  Shirt fit perfectly,  colors are good.  Delivery wad on time."
"This dress is really cute, fits nicely, and seems to be well made.

I'm looking forward to getting many, many wears out of it! :)

Be aware that this dress actually unbuttons in the front, so if you are busty, you may get some ""gap"" there. This can be easily fixed with just a few small stitches using needle and thread (as opposed to a sewing machine). Wouldn't take more than a few minutes, tops, and well worth the effort! :)"
Love the fact that these are light weight and comfortable as soon as you put them on.  Definitely recommend them
Very Cute outfit.  Fit great and looked darling on my daughter.
"Very happy with these covers.  Quality construction.  Work and fit as advertised.  Like them much better than the disposables.

Only slight negative was a very strong plastic/rubber smell (not something I would normally worry or comment about) for a bit.  Ended up removing them from the trunk and letting them sit in the garage for a few days.  Took care of the smell."
"Perfect for my outfit.... a little taller than expected, but they fit just right and have a tiny, elastic little strap at the back of the heel to help fit more snuggly."
I love sketchers and this is an addition to my collections. Light and comfortable and love the color combination. Would recommend to friends and consumers.
perfect fit. I look forward to winter so I can wear them again.
So sexy! Love the way it fits.
Really nice well made loved it on my grandchild
These sandals fit my very wide foot and my left foot is swollen from kidney disease. Thank you Sperry for:making sandals  that fit my feet. very hard to find.  When I get the money I will be getting another pair in a different color.
Good quality - I was just bummed that it was too big for my infant :(.  Would look to seller in the future for dresses.
"My daughter loved it! She uses it for soccer or dance practice. It's pretty large. It fits her soccer ball, shin guards, water bottle, iPod, and a few other small things. Or it also fits jazz, ballet, tap, hip hop, and house shoes perfectly. What she liked is that it doesn't seem bulky even with all of that stuff. She's 10 so it was the perfect size for her, but I can see it being a bit too big for a little one."
Such a cute top! Colors are very pretty! Looks exactly like the colors in the picture! Love it!
Always warm in it. Love the waterproof . Built to last
"I really do like them, I wish they have more colors I would definitely buy more"
"i use  around home and yard, works fine for me"
"Bought the yellow for future use and the red for current use in my toddler's summer camp school. Both have beautiful colors. I did size up on the red just to leave some room for my growing boy's feet. We like this style of these shoes and I always spare time to clean the white bottom rubber area and around the sides of the shoes every after use since he plays a lot around the sand in the playground. I use a toothbrush to scrub the dirt and upon washing the red shoes bleeds out red stains coming from the suede part everytime I wash the soap off. The red suede part however is starting lose it's vibrant red color leaving it paler than first use. The middle upper part of the shoes began to wrinkle after second use thus losing it's tautness. The velcro strap does run short. My son has narrow and long feet and when I close the velcro, sometimes it cuts short so I have to pull it again to tighten just to properly close both velcro ends. Not helpful for toddlers with wide and chubby feet I guess. It will probably unsnap. It is however durable and flexible. It has that old school classic design which I love. Other than the color bleeding out and the suede fading off while surface cleaning the sides and the short velcro closure, we still love this pair. Consider sizing up a little bit."
"I am a fan of Babylegs and have used them since my first was born five years ago.  These are not a one trick pony type of product.  You can make your own if you knit, or you can unicycle girls kneesocks and cut off the foot (very simple even for a beginner sewer), however, these are worth the investment especially if you shop around and wait for a bargain sale.

I never used these to protect knees, but the can be used for that purpose.  I used these instead of pant when practicing Elimination Communication, the were great for keeping on baby socks, they kept legs warm in winter under pants without adding bulk, they extended the usability of short pants in chilly weather by keeping the legs covered even if the pants rode up.  My five year old can still wear them as leg warmers, and they make wonderful arm warmers even for adults.

This product is versatile and has longevity.  One size fits most.  Chunky toughed babies will likely not fit well, but usually the slender down as the grow so you can use them eventually."
Nice sturdy locks and does what is expected out of it. Tried it out yesterday and worked like a charm. Like the additional feature of TSA open indicator. I might have trouble remembering the instructions for setting new number lock though... will probably take a pic of the instructions and save it for reference.
Wasn't expecting much due to the price but I can't complain about the shoe. It seems to be made well enough to go without falling apart. I will buy a nice polo shirt and slacks to go with these shoes and live like there is no tomorrow.
"My daughter wanted Minnie Mouse panties. She got them. Now she keeps them dry. I'm happy. Apart from the design, I'm sure the panties don't have anything to do with it.
Anyways, they're nice panties, fit my daughter perfectly, she can easily pull them on and off. A bit pricey, though."
I bought three of these dresses for photos.  They are so cute and the white is super crisp.
"I get lots of complements when I wear this tie, Nice Tie!"
"Cute dress,  pretty and well made for the money. It does run a little big. Suitable for work with a jacket  or shrug. Could be cute for a date or weekend with a denim jacket or chunky jewelry."
"amazing
Good material
great cut
fits perfect
perfect price cause this is to wear once or twice."
I've recently been running more and increasing my cardio. I have found this bra to be very supportive without the bulky padding of some other brands. I love the purple color. The straps also have not dug into my shoulders. I am considering buying another soon.
"Bought this messenger bag as an upgrade for two reasons: 1. I got tired of carrying my bag separate from my coffee flask (the Timbuk2 classic I had had the cup holder on the inside which was non-functional for my purpose). Its a tight squeeze, but my coffee fits on the outside holder of the Command. 2. If I carried my 13 MacBook in the classic, it got pretty bulky. The Command solved this by having a slight larger volume (small classic vs small Command) and the outside pocket for the laptop on the Command allows for continued use of the main compartment for papers/folders etc.

On top of those two thing I consider the new strap and the carrying handle on the Command an added bonus. Oh and the three Napoleon pockets work perfectly for holding and accessing  wallet and iPhone X without having to open the whole bag."
"Great Item, really like it :)"
nice bags. good price. great for gifting.
The left shoe seems to be a bit narrower than the right.  Or it could be my feet.  I like them so I'm hoping the leather stretches out over a few wears.
it is fine product
Saved my face on a recent trip to Florida!  Felt I looked good enough in the hat to wear it EVERYWHERE!
The first sweater came with the threading exposed on the front.  However it was a very easy painless Easy exchange.  Love the fitand the color is as depicted
I love these tops! I've order several and just ordered more. Excellent quality and amazing price.
Bought as a birthday gift for my 16 year old son. He loves it!
"Love Skechers brand.  This particular style does not have as much support as others styles I have purchased.  These run a bit wider which does not work as well for me since I have a more narrow foot.  Could do without the silver glitter accents.  Thought it was just gray when I purchased.
Nice shoe overall, just not my favorite of all the Skechers I have had."
"Good quality and warm. Long tall, stays tucked in."
"I LOVE this dress! I am 5'3"" and 130 lbs and the small fits perfectly. It is a tad long but I have some beige wedges that bring it up to a good length. Definitely worth the money and I can't wait to wear it come springtime!!"
Arrived on time but a little smaller than what I thought I was going to get.
Lovely warm cozy vest ! No complaints 
Love it. Very comfortable and kept sun of my son.
Needed a temporary ring. It wore it for a few weeks before the white gold started to rub off. It was cheap and did the trick.
I like but to big for me
"I wasn't sure what size to get, Im 137 lbs and 53 with a 32 DDD at Victorias Secret (I know they size you larger than other stores, just haven't purchased a bra elsewhere in a few years). I got a size 8 but may have been able to pull off a 6. I have a short torso so I was a little worried about how it might fit based on other reviews stating that the crotch area was kind of long. It fits almost perfectly, its a little tight around the top of my chest but the cup size itself is perfect. Its a little loose around the small of my back but other than that, its not digging into my glutes or stomach like Ive seen in some pictures. I think if you have significantly large thighs, glutes, or breasts with respect to your waist size you may have to buy a larger size and modify the suit to fit but I think it would be worth it. The quality is really high too, I was very surprised. I think if you get it and it doesnt fit, its definitely worth trying a different size or modifying it. Its flattering and modest yet fun. Im excited to wear it this summer."
"These hug your ankles; which I need; nice cushioning; great grip; fit as expected. You might want to know that they are not quite the same color as shown on the computer; at least on mine. They look like a light grey; they are actually a charcoal grey with light grey bottoms. Personally, I like the color better in person; easier to keep clean. I love these so much I am going to order another pair. I have numerous foot problems; and these feel great on my feet. Highly recommend. I do not hike or go on trails; got these just for walking and I am in love with them! I am a female; ordered an 8.5; a bit too big when I am normally 8.5 or a 9. I like this color and ordered mens 7 and they are perfect!"
Love these boots...the size runs a little big. So I suggest getting about a half size smaller. Other than that a they are well made and love them.
"What more or less can be said, it's Playtex 18-Hour.  Quality spelled out in the name of the brand. Comfortable, well made, fits exact to size but with still enough room to breath. Soft and gentle comfort against your body but will hold up to years of use.

Seriously. I moved to FL 10yrs ago this Dec. In prep for the relocation and adjusting for time to familiarize myself with new surroundings, I stocked up on necessities. Being a larger woman, I can't just walk into Wal-Mart for clothing needs. That said, I bought a dozen of my favorite Playtex 18-hr bras.  Just this past summer I had to start shopping around for replacements, after 10 yrs of rotating 12 bras, that is a good value for the cost!  So, long story short (I know, to late) I found them locally, but the price points were from $24 to $49. No way, I won't pay straight retail!!!
Just by chance I was strolling through the megapixels of Amazon sales windows.  When I found these bras, at this price....hmmmm?  To say the least I was skeptical of this cost, thinking seconds or returns.  Nope, brand new, still in original factory sealed shrinkwraps. Well packed, shipped on time.  RECOMMENDED 5' ''s for product & sale process."
"I am 5'7 with long legs and a short torso, so I was worried that these were one size fits all. But they are perfect - very warm and perfect length. I would even say they sit a bit too high on my waist, which is perfect for the cold winters. The colors are great, very vibrant. I'm so glad I bought these."
Love the color. Fits well.
Nice dress for dairy
Wonder quality! Soft material that washes very well! So cute and fits wonderfully! And it shipped super fast!
Great quality for the cost!!!
"This is a really beautiful 100% silk scarf. The best thing about real silk scarves is that they are naturally warm in the winter and they don't wrinkle easily even if you tie them in complex knots.

100% silk is naturally thin but also slinky, so it flows beautifully and looks great. Rayon scarves tend to wrinkle and can be too thick to be knotted around the neck without feeling too bulky. This scarf is 32 inch square so it's big enough to create some interesting designs.

This square scarf has a pretty pink rose in the middle on a yellow-beige background and a chocolate colored edge and print. It looks good tied on the head or knotted around the neck. There are so many youtube videos teaching different ways to tie a silk scarf. Also Pinterest and several sites like Hermes or Scarves dot com. But the classic look of just folding the scarf in a triangle and then into a band to wear around the neck under a blazer is wonderful. It gives a pop of color but also looks classy and can dress up a brown suit with a cream shirt with a little pizzaz. The thinner silk makes it less bulky than some thick silk scarves. Love it. The price is fabulous for a 100% silk scraf.

"LOVE LOVE LOVE MY BAGGALLINI'S

LOVE LOVE LOVE MY BAGGALLINI'SI have them in all sizes...  I just used this on vacation,,I used for my carry on bag for my purse on the plane and my purse emptied flattens out so well its so soft and playable,, I could slip it inside the bottom of my suite caseI like to travel light,,No checking baggage..for me,, and this bag held everything I couldn't fit on my carry on suit caseLunch bag, papers everything you need,etc,,, and the zipper flap opening to flip over the suit case handle is just perfection just like this bag...the carry on bag looks like a purse and is well within the limits for all airlines I just love them all !! I am not aware of any company out there that has the ballistic nylon material Baggallini uses in all their productsIt wears like iron,yet incredibly LIGHT and soft !!! ,,water resistant,, clean up very simple,, I hate carrying wallets in my purses or bags like this for vacation This bag exceeded my expectationsYou won't be sorry in any Baggallinis products,,, form function and pretty what more could you ask for !"
Decent weight denim with light flannel lining. Not as warm as fleece or thinsulate which get too warm when you go inside.
"I was hesitant to buy a sun dress online, but this dress is adorable and it looks great on all body types! I'm 5'6 and weigh around 147. I ordered a medium.

I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review"
"These sandals are lovely. True to size and the sole has padding so they're very comfortable for your kid. They are pretty hard leather, but she never complained, not even the first time she wore them. Love, love them!"
"Nice! Lightweight good quality, with lots of convenient pockets.
Dress it up of down. Very versatile!"
"The fit is good. Water proof very important. Just waiting to see how they wear. Or how they hold up. Comfortable right out of the box, big plus."
"I haven't worn these in snow or ice, but I have in mud and rain. They are perfect so far!!! I think they are extremely comfortable. The first few times I had a hint of heel rubbing, but no blister ever formed."
The wash on these are sick. I love them so much.
Love the way they fit my husband
"I love these boots. I bought them last winter and I wear them through snow, rain, and everything and they have gained me so many compliments. So cute for kids but even better for a petite young adult."
these are really short
I wear them all the time.  I am very happy.
"These jeans are incredible! I love how they look and they fit me very well. The only thing is I had to shorten them. The length is thirty inches and I need a 28"" length."
got this for a friend with metal plates in his face and it helped tremendously..
This is so adorable for my sons costume. The reason I took off a star is because of the thin material and the floppy fabric hat. I wish the hat was an actual cap instead of fabric that flops down over the forehead. And he will need to wear warm clothes underneath for trick or treating in our cold climate. But other than that it is PERFECT. Ordered size large for my huge 4 year old and it fits great  Would be too small for the typical 6 yr old though. I think max age would be 5 yrs old.
"Love K-Swiss. Light weight, berry comfortable, great support."
Good shoe. Sizing is different than some shoes
"Great product, fast delivery! I get so many compliments on these boots and they're very sturdy."
"Perfect fit.  COmfortable, casual.  I cant say enough good about it.  I would certainly recommend this product to other people."
My husband really like his warm-up suit.
"I ordered this for my teen.  He had another size 10 crocs that fit fine, but we didn't realize the padding would basically make the shoe a size smaller.  He is wearing them, tho, because he hates wearing socks and they are warm and fuzzy!"
"CROCS are great, but much too wide for my little girl's foot. I need to check out there other styles to see if something else would fit her better. Her narrow foot was swimming in these puppies."
Super cute but tore after 2 wears and one wash. But I suppose this isn't something that needs to be worn a million times so I would recommend.
"This pair of Havaianas flip flops is so comfortable,to wear that you would not like to keep them off your feet! This Summertime I am wearing them for hours."
These skirts are soooooo comfortable!!!!!  I want more!!!!!!
shipped slow. otherwise nice
Really comfortable. I got these on a lightning deal to use during labor in the hospital and I can't stop wearing them. I really like how supportive and soft the soles are. Great slippers to wear around the house. Not too wide or narrow.
Rockport is a brand name.  I purchased this when it was in Amazon's Today's Deals and immediately purchased for half price.  My shoe size is difficult to find. This was somewhat tight on my feet for a few days but I guess now I am used to it or the leather has expanded. Similar shoe from Frye is $ 150.00 which I bought last year but it is much comfortable from day one.
"I purchased this dress as a lingerie piece. For me, it's a bit revealing to wear out in public. With that said, it is well made and very sexy. I love the way the dress is fitted and then flairs out at the bottom (fishtail). I am 5'8 160lbs and I feel like a medium is a tab bit too large. However, as I stated, I will only wear it in the home so, I'm not exchanging it. I absolutely love the dress though."
"good for costume, hair was falling all over the place"
Cute little set!
"These are my new favs mainly because they have a perfect amount of distress without going overboard. They also have an amazing amount of stretch which makes them as comfortable as lounge pants. My only negative is that they stretch out as you wear them. I cant even say thats a true negative, though. I only mention it because I wouldve gone down a size if I had known so maybe this post will help others. I still wear them though and I bought the next size down too. The denim is very soft and I just cant say enough good things about these gems!"
And these fit great. Small heads may find these a little big. I hate when sunglasses are so tight they give me a headache or leave marks. These are not that way. Love Them! Great purchase!
"This robe is super soft, warm, and comfortable. Great Purchase!!"
Kinda of annoying about hot great everyone is talking about these fitting without letting you know their body size. Bought the medium fit is good there a bit more room than I like width wise but for the most part its a good fit.
"Best glasses I've ever had. I will buy nothing else. This is my third pair in 20+ years...I lost one pair, and broke the other..."
"I received my boots today and they are incredible!  First I would like to say that when I opened the box my mouth dropped open, the picture does not do them justice.  They are beautiful and such amazing craftsmanship!  The leather is so rich in color and the wing tip, two color boot front is so attractive!  I have been looking for black boots for some time now and frankly they all appeared somewhat boring to me.  My purpose for this purchase was for a dress boot.  A boot that would be a compliment for church to any other occasion when the every day boot is not enough.  The multi color is a bonus and asset for the ever changing wardrobe need. Justin boots are incredibly made and I ordered the size 6 with the c width (it was available :) and this is not always the case) because of my wide feet do to bunions.  I am a happy woman and I will continue to purchase Justin boots.  I have a very high arch and the Justin boots I own give me the best support I have ever had.  I expect a lot from Justin and once again they delivered!  Definitely recommend these boots and the Justin Company!"
"Oh the softness! This robe is comfort x10. So soft, so warm. Fits just the way I'd want a comfy robe to fit. There's nothing more cozy than sliding into it after a hot shower and couching with some warm yummy beverage. Great find."
"I already had a pair of these shoes for which I was fitted at a running store; therefore, I had the benefit of knowing that they fit before buying. I love these shoes for running.

I have a pretty neutral foot, and these shoes give me all of the support that I need when running. I've used this brand and version to train for two marathons and three half-marathons. They've never let me down until they needed to be replaced because of too many miles.

I just ordered another pair to replace a very worn-out pair of Guide 5s. Love my Saucony running shoes!"
"fast shipping, authentic Chucks. Very pleased"
Quality shirts at a great price. Cost effective and well made.
"I love these.  I tend to lose my unsecured nose rings on the regular and these are a great deal for multiple colours. No irritation, keep their shape, easy to insert and look great.  Would definitely buy again."
"These fit so nicely! Love them, great walking boot and seems somewhat water resistant, which is great!"
This is beautiful and I get compliments from everyone when I wear it. Please note the size is probably about as big as a quarter and it does not come with a chain. Accurate to the picture shown however.
"My granddaughter has always had problems with her bra size, she has always been full size, so when she told me about this spanx bra with the crisscross straps I had to get it for her,  It fits perfect and she is more confident when she goes out now with whatever she wears.  Thank you is is a perfect fit and a beautiful sophisticated  look."
"I got these to ""try"" the look out.  Find out I still need to lose more weight.  Hoping that they will fit me better when I do.  I ordered a L thinking it might work. No, so maybe in ten pounds.....  Seem good quality (I am new to thongs!!!)"
"washed in hot water and dried in hot dryer as too long and knew that I would need to have hemmed. Washes well, dries without needing ironing. Although need to have hemmed, I'd much rather have them too long than too short. I have several colors of the Paley Pull On Boot cut and love them. No one would know that they are pull on unless you wanted to wear a tucked in shirt."
"I read the other reviews, I ordered 2 sizes larger and well...  It was too big.  I am returning it and ordering a large.  My measurements are 38 bust 32 waist.  Hopefully in a few days when the large arrives I'm have a better review."
The dress is pretty. The white color though is completely see through so I returned it. I will try another color because I really like the dress and how it fits.
Gift for the hubs. He loved this and the matching hoodie. Excellent quality that will last and is water repellant.
"I am normally a 6.5-7, depending on the shoe and how I want it to fit. I originally ordered a 7 in these, but exchanged them for a 6.5. I have slightly wide feet (not wide enough where I need to buy a wide size) and they fit perfectly! I don't have problems with them squishing my toes width wise, or height wise. I've walked around in them quite a bit already and they are very comfortable!! The heel is very solid and kind of makes a ""clack"" sound when you walk, but I didn't find that obnoxious like some other shoes I have owned."
"These boots are fantastic - comfortable all day long. I added an insole as they didn't have enough padding as-is. I have a wide foot, wear an 8.5, and I got the 9, which (even with the insole) fit great. I can't say how waterproof they are as I haven't submerged them entirely, but in the snow they are just fine."
"Amazing for entertaining! The mask came a bit wrinkled due to the packaging and the whiskers were bent, but if you fill it with a t-shirt or something similar, it works like a charm.  Easy to see through as well."
"After watching a few on line video presentations on how to resize a watch, I bought this inexpensive tool.  I used it on an Invicta automatic watch. It worked perfectly.  I did not have any problems (other than a minor operator error).  I would recommend this if you are a hands on person.  Otherwise, just take your watches to a watch shop."
"love, love this watch"
"These are very nice.  The shape and size is lovely.

However in comparison to several other pieces of CZ jewelry that fits in the ""Canary Yellow"" vein these are extremely pale.  Enough so that they look instead like they are a just-off-clear rather than actually yellow.

This is the only think I would change about these to give them a solid 5 star rating.  If they were just a little more yellow they would have been awesome.  Compare for yourself.  Look at the pictures within the amazon curated collection specifically at the other platinum plated sterling silver yellow CZ jewelry to see how much more pale these really are.

While I would recommend them I suppose, I am on the look out for some that are more matching to the rings etc..."
"Do not know if you can wear comfortably more than an hour, because the water class I am in only lasts 1 hour"
Love these shoes. This was my first pair of the Teva sneakers. They have nice arch support. I've never had a problem or needed any arch support but the older you get just like every other girly part the arches start to fall too. Very comfortable. I have a wide foot and these fit just fine with a thin sock. The color was exactly as pictrured. I read a previous review that said they were more green. Mine were teal just as pictured. I received two sets of laces. Very nice purchase and would consider purchasing another pair in a different color.
"These are great glasses at keeping the sun out and I live in Florida, so need them practically every day when I drive. They did fog up once when I sweat, didn't think they were supposed to do that but it only happened once and a lens popped out several times which was annoying but I could pop it right back in and they were fine. Worth their Money."
"I love these, and will buy my shoes only from Clarke's in the future."
These jeans is what i expected
Bought as a present for my dad and he LOVED it. My dad is 6' 2' and the tall XL was
They're adjustable and so comfortable and professional enough to wear to work. Love them!
"Just what she wanted, excellent workmanship"
i love it so adorable its smaller than i thought which is cool cuz i was afraid it would be to chunky or to heavy to wear but it really nice i recommend
"I discover these jeans this year. I love them! Material is a lighter weight, great for summer. I have a smaller waist ratio with the hips. Finally found a jean that fits in the waist and butt. I am 5'3, 140 pounds, size 7 fits great, they are on the long side, had to cut 1"" off and re-hem."
This is a great scarf (especially for the price).  I've already worn it a few times and it looks really good on (lots of ways to wear it).  Nice soft material.
"I love my Asics, and Amazon gets them to me so quickly. The shoes fit well and look great!"
"Love this!  Very cute, great pattern, and very durable material."
This was a Chanukah gift for a long-distance 11-year-old granddaughter who is taking flute lessons. She loves the instrument and this necklace was a hit.
"I loved this necklace and was so pleased when I got it in the mail. It is vibrant and it's great quality. The necklace is heavy and all of the beading is well in place. I have no concerns about it breaking or coming loose. I would recommend this necklace to anyone who is trying to spruce up a spring outfit. Goes great with dresses and have found so much fun in pairing it with a t-shirt and white blazer. I would only warn for those with long hair to be careful because it can snag some of the strands at the nape of your neck... small issue, great buy overall!"
"nice shirt ,fit grate"
"Great bag! I've been searching for the *perfect* bag to accommodate my highly mobile lifestyle. This is about as close as I think I will ever get. I carry my iPad, phone, clutch wallet and various accoutrements whenever I leave the house. In addition to that, I have several file folders that I lug around in a plastic envelope. These limit my options a bit, but still....... They fit!
I've also used this to carry my dSLR camera and a spare lens, which I can only do by removing the iPad and folders. Very comfortable, expandable bag. I love having easy access to my wallet and phone in the outer pockets, although I'll rethink this placement when I'm traveling in touristy areas (pickpockets). Being able to switch from purse to backpack is a cinch and really helpful depending on what else I'm carrying.

The best part is that I get all kinds of compliments. I wanted something that would be equally acceptable at my professional job or hiking a trail or zipping by the grocery store. This guy feels comfortable in all environments, never too dressy or too trashy. Leather is quality, construction feels solid, and it feels like a bag I will have for a long time.

Cons: the fabric catches in the zipper just a tidge, but it didn't take me long to adjust the way I zip/unzip. Not even worth deducting a star.

Great bag, seller was outstanding. Happy customer!"
It was perfect size and the colors were vibrant. Lots of space inside for everything.
My second pair these are sooooo cute have in tan too. I wear a 7 1/2 the size 7 fit perfectly. Can wear them all day feet stay warm and dry. Very stylish
Fits perfect! I love it!!!
"This costume fit perfectly! I ordered an X Large as I am a size 16, 228, and curvy. My stomach is flat and I figure this costume would do my justice and it did!
The only issue I have is the zipper should be a little longer but it isn't costume so no biggie."
"Looks good, good gift.  Fine quality"
Me likey this product! I'd like to buy more in the future..hopefully i can have a discount! I'd like to recommend this product to all my friends!
love the look at fit of this belt - it works great.  really good value.
"Very comfortable walking shoes and seem to be holding up well.  They seem to be sized correctly as well, not short like some brands."
"I didn't get to see the jacket on my son in law in person yet, just in a photo but he loves it. I read reviews saying that it runs small so I changed my order from XL to XXL. It looked nice in the photo but I think I could have stayed with the XL."
"OMG!  This is so cute!  We got so many complements, and my son doesn't want to take it off.  We got size 3-4, and he's about 25lb, and almost 3 years old.  The size is very forgiving, so if it's a little long in the legs and arms, just roll in under.  It's comfortable to wear with warm clothing underneath if you live in a cold area like we do, and a soft hooded sweatshirt fits nicely under the headpiece.  The wings are Velcro'd on, so they can get bumped off when they run into things, but it could easily be fixed with a safety pin.  I highly recommend this costume, and I don't know how I'll top it next year!"
"The perfect swim diaper- easy enough to get on and off, fits true to size. I ordered the white so it would go with every swimsuit. I ordered one with snaps- note that the snaps are only on one side."
"great fit,was worried that it would feel too loose around the heel,not a problem"
Comfortable but look worn after just a few washes.
"Love the socks, very comfortable and love the colors"
I replaced this exact band which held up well to 3-years of daily abuse. Really didn't even need to be replaced. Highly recommend.
I love these boots! I have large calf muscles so I need boots that stretch. These boots had the stretch but still looks sleek. Very comfortable too!
"SO freakin adorable!!! I ordered this as a gift for a friend who just sets her rings on the counter. I know she'll love it! I want to order one for myself, I just wish it was a little cheaper."
"This shirt is very cute, and good fit."
I tried the shoes on in the store in the leather was like butter. Then when  I ordered through Amazon it was a little stiff. I received blisters while breaking them in. But the foot bed is super comfortable and supportive. Very comfortable.  I love them!
My husband wears it all the time because it won't hurt him it gets caught on anything! And it's comfortable!
"They shrunk after washing. Fit great at first, now hubby says they are a bit too snug.  I love the beautiful colors they came in, bright orange, nice lime, pretty blues.  Just wish the size stayed true."
Love it.... the size is perfect a bit bigger than your normal carry on bag but I had no issues at the airport.
It's a little big but I it's a keeper. Very warm and stylish.
seems good quality-- nice colors
"Fits great and feels good, exactly like the description given."
"It's second time that I've purchased  Brumby Shearling Sheepskin boots and I'm very satisfied. Eexcellent quality, very comfy, cool looking, proper sheepskin boots. I highly recommend."
"Good shoes confortable at first.. then hurt after 8 hours of breaking in. I do expos where i stand a lot. these are not 8 hours standing confortable.
they are great going out shoes."
"Just be warned, they shrink when you wash them, which I expected because they are 100% cotton. DO NOT DRY THEM IN THE DRYER. They shrunk with laying flat to dry. I'm a broad shouldered girl, so Men's small typically fits great. It was too big unwashed, now it's perfect. (Let's hope that they don't keep shrinking, or I'm screwed! o. O)"
Like them.  They stay in place and don't show.  They are lightweight.
These ELVA-07's are the greatest. I Love these ELVA-07 Women's Slip Platform Cut design mules. Comfortable and Stylish.
"Nice blouse, fits well and a lovely casual bolero."
"This is my second bag, I wear this one on my bike all the time, started wearing out in 3 rd season, just got this one as a back up"
Bought as a gift for my son. The t-shirt was good quality and sizing was perfect.
"Brought this thing for our kids Verizon Gizmo 2, since the plastic one that came with it broke easily. Fit the watch and was pretty much easy to replace for being the first time we ever replaced a watch band. Compared to getting a whole new band thing it saved way lots!"
Adorable.  Easy to wear and maybe one of the best Burberry knockoffs I've ever seen.
"for my feet they are a little to narrow. right now they're ok but as i wear them more often they get more comfortable so i'll try to update this in a month or two to let everyone know if they stay comfortable.

UPDATE:
a few weeks ago i went to the swap meet and was walking around a good 4 hour and i have to say i have never been happier buying a pair of sandals in my life still need a bit of breaking in but still i'm very happy with these sandals. easily the best sandal i have ever worn."
Great shoes.  Live in them.
True to size every time. Lasts twice as long as any other brand I've purchased. Been wearing this brand for over 20 years.
"I have had plantar faciitis and must be careful what type of shoes I wear.  Although pricey, the MBT's are great shoes not only for the feet, but also for the legs and back.  If you are new to MBT shoes, I would not recommend wearing them all day at first.  Gradually ease into using them all day."
"With rain in the forecast I decided that I really should get around to buying rain boots.  The walk from my car to my office is pretty long and when it's raining, it's torture.  I'm very pleased with these boots so far; they're comfy enough for me to hike back and forth between the office and where I've parked.  The green color is nice looking!

The fit is definitely not for everybody.  I'm tall and lanky with about 15"" calves - these boots are skintight at the top and cover the majority of my calves, which is impressive.  So while that's great for me, I could see it being less than great for those with average sized legs.  I'm usually an 8.5 in most shoes and ordered these in a 9, which ended up fitting wonderfully."
Very comfortable to wear for everyday use. Fits and looks great as well.
"I like them but I purchased them at the wrong time, it was already to a point I do not need gloves"
"I purchased a small in the Blue. I am 5'9"" 130lbs, 34C-D (depending on the bra), 27"" waist, 37-38"" hips and a very long torso.
First, the pro's: The color is very true to what I saw on the computer when I ordered it; very vibrant. It pops against my ultra-white self. The molded cups are nice and give good support to the girls. They are DEMI coverage, not full coverage. The material is typical swim suit material and looks to be well sewn. No odd smell to it and had the hygenic liner intact. The ties lay nicely when you take the time to tie them correctly and the small seems to have adequate length to make the ties. The bottoms rise higher than my belly button and I have a long frame.

The cons are few and not deal breakers, but I have to at least mention. The leg openings are tight (which means they won't go anywhere) but even on my thin frame, they were too tight. Will have to gently stretch them out to make them a little more comfortable. The bottoms are generous on material - this might be because of the shirring - but there is no control in them for those that have tummy worries. The shirring might disguise a little, but there is absolutely no control and if you do not have the curvy shape (ie: waist-hips ratio) it will not give that to you. That being said, it is extremely comfortable and not constricting at all around the waist.

As with every swim suit that you want to hang on to for a while, always wash by hand or in cold water with like-colors. Make sure you rinse immediately after contact with chlorine pools or spas (it's better for your skin anyways) and NEVER put them in the dryer; always hang dry away from the sun.

I am happy with this purchase."
"great flip flops, stylish and comfortable, hold up well, shipped fast, so comfy
love that they have in several colors"
Fit for my wife was perfect. She normally wears a large in sweaters and coats and this fit her perfectly. Color and material are nice and soft. Definitely worth it for the price. It's a nice attractive coat for a good price.
this is my second pair. these are the most comfortable boots I have ever worn and I am hard to please.
Keep in mind they run large!
I love this little purse!  It is great for travel because it is small and fits close to the body.  The main part of the purse has a sturdy zipper and then a snap flap to keep your valuables secure. There is a small outside zippered pocket perfect for my keys. I have used this for about 10 months and it has worn very well.  Highly recommend.
"This is my favorite shapewear! The torso is a little long but to prevent rolling I tuck it under my bra and it works perfect. It's tight enough to smooth everything out yet it's comfortable. I personally like that the legs do not have elestic because I find it creates a crease which then makes it obvious you are wearing shapewear ( I usually wear it under pants/jeans). Before I put my jeans on, I just pull down the thing material a little more than where I would like it to stay, and adjust one my jeans are all the way on.
Only downside, although the material is breathable, after some extended wear throughout the day, my things will chafe.
Over all great product for a great price."
"I gave these to my mom as a mother's day gift, not knowing that it would be her last. She passed away a month later. She enjoyed these and loved the way they sparkled.  They fit perfectly and kept her feet warm and pretty.  I miss my mom so much but I'm glad I was able to make her last days happy."
More than satisfied!
"Great quality, soft material!"
I didn't realize when I ordered these that they were wide shaft. I think I may send back. Still debating. They are very comfy though.
These are beautiful.  They add a high quality look to your wardrobe.
These are terrific! I have an angel wings pendant and was looking for earrings to match. These definitely fill the need and they are very pretty. Quality for a good price.
Pretty and a good fit.  Works as a wedding band for everyday use.  Love it!
"He hasn't worn them all day (kicks off shoes as with all of them he owns), but seems to quite like them.  Bought to go with his cowboy halloween costume (year two of it, he loves it) so thought I would buy him a pair of boots to go with it this year.  He's worn several times and I can't complain about anything so far.  They make a satisfying heel noise that he dances around listening to (he's four).  So far, would buy again."
"Very pretty, just like the picture."
"These are my favorite pants to wear because they are so attention grabbing! People always ask me where I got them. I can work in these, I can dance in these, I could sleep in them if I wanted to, because they are incredibly comfortable. The top can be worn folded down, but I just wear it over my belly because it is so slimming. Love these pants"
"Good product, and arrived on time.  I chose this style because of the slim fit (and the vertical patterns).  Although the sleeves were as long as expected (nice!!!) the slim fit was still a little too loose for me (even though I am not that slim myself).  I am 6' 2"", 250 lbs, and chose 2XL.  If you have some/a lot of belly, then I would say it would fit you good.

Cotton materiel used seems of high quality.  Looks/feels strong, and keeps the shape nicely.  Still, I have only used it once, so I cannot attest for durability, yet."
"These earrings are very pretty and dearly festive for Valentine's Day. I bought these for my two year old daughter and she loves them. The posts are a little long for a child her age but we have not had any issues with it. They even have the locking backs so she can't pull them out. I love how these red hearts bring out her crystal blue eyes. The red hearts are a little on the larger side.. I think the description said 5mm. But we havn't had an issue with the size of the stones either. They look stunning on her no matter what outfit she wears too. I was concerned with allergic reaction to the jewelry, we have not had and issue with the earrings turning her ear green, no infection, no redness ... Nothing. I received these at a discount price for a n honest review and I can honestly say I love these earrings. I would pay full price and then some. The quality of these earrings is unbeatable. I have been searching for a good pair for my daughter and I have found them."
"Perfect, as advertised. Well made, soft and comfortable"
"These shoes are really perfect. I found them on MyHabit first and now am sad I didn't order two in every color. Made with quality materials, the shoes are well manufactured, look great (timeless design really) and amazingly comfortable. Best price I've seen (aside from the amazing deal I got on MyHabit) is here on Amazon. Will certainly buy more soon."
Not mine was a gift to someone else
"I MUST WEAR ORTHOTICS IN MY SHOES AND ORDERED DOUBLE WIDE, LOVE THIS SHOES.  SO COMFORTABLE, SHEEK LOOKING AND WELL MADE.  I AM A TOUGH SHOE CRITIC AND GIVE THESE 5 STAR.  MIGHT LOOK INTO OTHER STYLES OF EASY SPIRIT SHOES."
I liked these but the ran too narrow for us
"Looks like real leather, Got lots of compliments on this belt. Just wish shipping wasn't as much as the item itself!"
"It's Under Armour, superior products"
Small in the waist huge in the boobs. Order larger because they run small in waist but if you are small chested you will need to alter lime I am doing
"This bra fits well for my full busted figure.  It is hard to find a high support bra for full busted active women (38D).  This one works for me.  Kick boxing, boxing, running, TRX & lifting and the support is there.  It does show under sheer fabrics but then again what doesn't.  It covers enough so I can go with just the bra when I am really hot. Looks great under a tank too.  I wish there was a bright red color.  More color options would be great.  I do not throw in dryer. My daughter helped with laundry one day &now one of my white bras feel a bit snug.  I prefer to machine wash (or hand wash) & air dry to allow it to last longer."
I bought bigger thinking there clothes were going to be super small like other reviews on any allegra k items. I am 5'3 135 b cub. I bought medium size 10 however not a us womens size 10. More like a jrs large. I wear jrs size 9 bottoms and tops medium. In womens I wear a 6 but not like old navy size 6 or express size 6 or new york new york size 6 which then im more like a 4.  Target tops I wear small and pants i wear 4 low cut waist. American clothes are made different.  I think i should of just bought the small size. These are best for petite. Good deal!
"I absolutely loved this shirt, it fit as expected and it was truly an amazing added addition to my birthday outfit!! This is a must have for your special day!"
"Fit is slightly on smaller side but for my granddaughter, it was perfect!"
Great T-shirt...The fit is a little small but I am still able to wear it.
I was looking for these for a while and the price was great.  They arrived quickly as well.
"I think it's nice for the guy that does elevation changes and such. The active guy that loves to trail run or something where he can get lost. It's a really great watch. My draw backs are this: A) The stop watch portion is on the small part of the display and does not take over where the time is for the clock, I read and read and could not find an alternative options to make it big, which makes it annoying when running for time where you want a quick check. B) Doing pushups presses the buttons and activates the compass. You can turn it over which is fine and there is a button lock for this purpose, but with my quick cycle between pushups and sit-ups for the Air Force it makes it inconvenient when I am trying to access my stopwatch. All in all I would recommend this, also look at the other models that this brand has to offer, brand to people due to how well built it is. The rubber watch band is nice, plus you can replace it if it breaks or gets worn out like I have heard from others with this model."
"Clark's quality at its best. Comfortable, true to size, elegant. Will definitely buy other colors"
They are beautiful but smaller than I expected. Came in a simple yet nice jewelry box with the earings in great condition. Seem to be pretty sturdy and the clasp appears to be on tight.
Nice one. I would recommend it as the clothing is light
Great dress!  Wish the material wouldn't ball up after a few washes.
Love these chains
First pair I put on ripped on day 1. Not good! The others seem fine so far. I expect more than one use for that price.
"These fit perfect, and the colour shown in the photo is exactly the same (sometimes the colours in the pictures can be off). Comfy too!"
"Got this for my wife for when we go out she's not wearing her good ones.
Looks great and she's always getting compliments."
Everything I've ever wanted!!!!
"Love the fit, look, wear!"
"It looks John Gotti style, but ill
wear it."
My favorite purse by far. I get TONS on compliments when out. It's very large just like I like it. Stands out for sure!!! LOVE
"So I saw this hat in an ad for Ralph Lauren or something (magazine ad) and looked up what the model was wearing to find it. It was like $200. Which leads me to my purchase on Amazon.

The hat is very cute. I measured my head and used the sizing guide before purchasing and it fits great. I don't plan on sailing the seas or anything so if you need this for something hardcore, this probably isn't the best due to the other reviews about the band being stapled, etc. However, I plan on wearing this as an everyday look, especially in the winter or rainy days!"
Yes this is a thicker heavier shirt thus the beefy name. This shirt fits great. I took it out of the dryer layed it flat on the bed. Later put it on a hanger. Looks like I ironed it. Very comfortable. Well wortg the price.
Very comfortable to ear all day long. Stretches to the size you need and holds up. Supports your breast very well for smaller breast. Also no show bra straps.
great quality. I'm returning to get a 12.  Purchased the navy & it is a good true color.
"These are great-looking shoes that fit true to size.  Pretty comfortable, especially for someone who walks to work, but not perfect which is why I didn't give them 5 stars.  Still, a good shoe for the price."
"As context I've just discovered the phenomenon of less blousy button front shirts for men. This shirt has way less material in the waist than the non-fitted, but I'm a bit irritated that it doesn't have less. It's a fine professional setting dress shirt."
"I absolutely love this dress. It fits like a glove. Just the right amount of stretch. I ordered the small based on reviews and sizing and it is perfect. I am 5'4"" and 127 lbs. This is very comfortable and looks much more expensive than it is! I can't wait to wear it for my black tie event!"
Smaller than I expected them to be but still very gorgeous. And I like that the post is in the middle so the stud/ earring does not dangle. You should buy these.
"I purchased these because of the other Jefferies socks that we own and love.  The color looks more like we ran them through a red load and forgot about them.  I am not sure I really like the pink/grey combo in person.  However, the cushion is fabulous!  The kiddos literally feel like they're walking on pillows (their words).  With that, I'm happy to have purchased these socks!"
Wish they were a bit heavier but a good value all the same.
Amazing - so comfortable.  I wear a 5.5 and ordered a 6 and they fit great.  Want to get more colors!
"This is a really nice looking piece in person. Fabric is a bit tight. No stretch to it. The shoulders are a bit narrow, though. If you have broad shoulders, you will likely need a size larger than you normally wear.
It also looks cute with a belt and leggings."
Extremely comfortable but runs a full size too small.  Consider this if purchasing.  The quality of Acorn shoes are unmatched and the most comfortable slippers I have.
"perfect fit and sizing. i wear 9.5 in all kenneth cole, skechers and converse all stars for reference. comfortable as easy to move around in. though it may feel like your feet with socks will slide a bit because of the insole material. overall, i would buy again."
"Really like these a lot.  I got them in two colors.  Package arrived quickly and the items (I bought two) seem to fit as expected (I sized up like others suggested) and they were in good condition.  I looked them over pretty good since others complained but they seem brand new, smelled new, packaged as new and no rips or tears that I can see.  Pretty happy with the purchase."
"I ordered this shirt in an XL and it only took 2 days to get it! I am 5'5 and 175 pounds with a curvy body style and it fits like a glove! Very comfortable fabric, stretchy if needed, and it's the type of shirt that can be worn with anything, shorts, a skirt or pants/leggings!"
"Nice item, does run small though"
Fit well. So soft. So comfy.
"This is not at all my typical style of dress. My cousin wanted this style for her bridesmaids (as her style is very modest and conservative whereas I am not at all) I cringed not only at the dress but also the price tag the bridal shop was asking me to pay for a dress I didn't even want! Im so glad I found a much more affordable replica of the one my cousin wanted us to get at the bridal shop, and when I put it on it fit perfectly since it is somewhat stretchy material! While it is not my style I received many compliments and even had strangers approach me asking to take my photo so they could give their daughters ideas about cute bridesmaid dresses for their own weddings. Overall have to give this dress good reviews even though its not my style since it did save me a lot of money, and got a lot of compliments which helped make me feel beautiful wearing it :)"
Love it. Super cute!!
"There is much to love about these sandals.  From the top, they are strappy and attractive enough to be worn with dresses to a nice occasion.  But they are VERY supportive - as Merrell's tend to be.  I bought them because I love my Merrell hiking boot and wanted some of the same toughness on the sole but something I could wear with dresses and skirts.  I was not disappointed!  They do seem to run a bit large, which is strange since I'm usually a solid size 9 in Merrell shoes.  There are velcro adjustments at the back of the heel, but these are maxed out for me with still a little room.  Still, they aren't so big as to cause blisters or anything.  My one real complaint is the buckle on the side.  It is small and feels delicate - though I haven't had any breakage yet.  But it is completely impossible to open.  It's a squeeze from the sides type buckle and I just cannot get it to release.  I understand that for such a narrow strap, a narrow buckle is required but I think they should've gone with a different type.  I've been just slipping the sandals on, since there's a little extra room, but this pulls at the velcro back and I fear may eventually cause some problems.  Still!  Lovely, comfortable sandals at such a price - both stylish and practical - that's pretty good."
Good quality. Recipient says they're comfortable.
"Perfect surprise for our Cars obsessed preschooler! Note that this is a smaller size for little ones. Had a quite strong plastic odor on arrival, but we love it otherwise."
These are cute but just WAY to big for my daughter. I bought a size 4 for my 1 year old and she has small feet but I will be lucky if they fit her next summer.
"I love this bag and that it has sewn in pockets inside and outside. The sewn pockets on the inside make hiding and securing items very easy. The gold is obviously costume like on the purse. The bag came wrapped and packaged very well, like a designer bag. My only complaint is that the color of this purse looks like puke in person."
Have as gift. She loved them.
very nice work shoe this is my second pair. I wish the patent pair had fit me and was comfortable but they weren't
Comfortable but maybe will be too loose if they stretch? But  Overall I think I like them. Make my foot very long looking... Yeah boats. ( size ten)
"I love these jeans. The denim isn't too heavy or too thin. They are very stretchy and cling in the right places. They do lose their shape/stretch out just a little throughout the day, but not too bad. I am 5'10"" and usually need talls, but the length on these is perfect, even after washing (and line drying). The rise is definitely high, they sit right at my belly button. I ordered the darkwash but am almost positive I received the indigo. I'm not a huge fan of the color but I kept them anyway. There's no magical ""butt lifting"" aspect in these jeans, but they fit my bottom nicely. With all that said, the bad thing about these jeans is the smell. They have a very strong chemical smell similar to fuel or car exhaust. I've washed them twice so far and I can still smell it. I'm hoping it'll eventually go away. I do love these jeans, though, and will probably buy another color in the near future.

Edit:  bought another pair in the gunmetal color and they were extremely tight around the calf. And I have oddly skinny, nonmuscular calves. I'm very disappointed, as the fit obviously varies between colors."
The quality is not supper but it work for us. I bought them for hubby as we travel alot and need clothes that are quick drying. They dry fast in a hotel room bathroom. Just though they will be a little more durable.
Great chain- perfect length at 22 inches... I looked at lots of choices in chains and this one appealed to me..  will be buying several more... Good service. Packaged nicely... The price was good. Much nicer than I thought it could be for  that price... Definitely will recommend it..
What can I say besides the fact that they are Jessica Simpson shoes and cute as ever!  Simply love them.
