Poorly made. Shrinks and doesn't fit well.
"I've been playing Santa for 25 years ... I have authentic high-quality Santa boots and a very high-end costume, except for the belt.  I never got around to replacing that cheap belt.  So this year I thought I'd make the shift. This belt has rave reviews on Amazon and runs about half the price of the leather Santa belts on Amazon, so I thought I'd gamble.  I'm kinda sorry I did.  The only thing that is quality about this belt is the buckle.  It is VERY nice.  But the black Naugahyde is only about 15 - 20% thicker than the cheap belt I had, and frankly, looks about the same.  The rivets in the holes are the exact same cheap metal as on my cheap costume belt.  The buckle is great. The belt?  Meh.  So yes, the buckle is VERY nice, but this belt is not worth the price asked.  I wished I spent the extra money to get a nice leather Santa belt.

By the way, if this is all your budget allows, know that the belt runs pretty large.  If you even think you might need the smaller one, GET THE SMALLER ONE."
"I bought two of these because one had a better shipping schedule. The second pair are great. The first pair that took the longest to arrive broke beyond repair the very first time I wore them. I took a picture, but don't see an upload option on mobile. The clasp on the right shoe tore completely away as I was walking.
It's a shame. The other pair are great. Glad I still have those."
"Came out of the box with scratches on one lense. I know they are inexpensive, but they're unusable with a big scratch... That kind of defeats the mirrored lens effect."
"Okay, this is kind of hard to explain. I really liked the skirt, but I do not know if it is my body type or just how to skirt was constructed. Initially, I ordered a size medium, which was huge, so I returned it and ordered a small. I should also mention that I am usually a small to medium in skirts so I was sure that the small would be fine. When I tried on the small, the waist was still pretty large but I thought that I could work with it. Then, I tried it on with a shirt tucked in, and it just looked so strange. The waist was too large, but then the section that falls on the hips is tighter than the waist. This is clearly not a free hip skirt and doesn't really give you the ""circle skirt"" effect that vintage style skirts usually do. This might be a body type issue, but I don't know."
"The illustrations aren't even close.  I didn't care about which colors I received but I wanted the bright and vibrant colors on the picture.
I received mostly grey and a maroon in very dull fashion.  I am tired of returning stuff because on the not exactly substitutions.
Don't qualify the product, send pictures that represent what I am going to get."
Size was way off.  I regularly wear a 12 and the size 12 of these was at least an inch too long

"3x does not fit, it is small. I usually wear a 2x. This material is thin and the Blazer looks like a shirt."
"I ordered the same watch in silver and loved it, so I decided to order the rose gold too.  After removing a couple links to make it fit, I tried the watch on and realized it didn't work.  I set it and the second hand started ticking, but only lasted a few seconds, got stuck, and stopped moving.  It was cheap enough I didn't bother sending it back, but instead used the parts to fix my first watch when the pin broke."
"The product's image is incorrect, the item I got (Arctic color) doesn't have worn areas and overall seems in different color. Attaching the pictures so that everyone knows what they are actually buying.
I am super disappointed, really loved how it looked on the photo. This is not the cheapest product, so money wasted in vain.

P.S. So this is how you become the richest man on Earth."
"I usually skeptical of ordering rings online, this time my skepticism was well deserved! I ordered this to replace the one I lost, in like 48 hours, my finger turned green. I have to have sterling silver, which is in the name, but if you don't see it is Sterling Silver PLATED! so not real silver, the price was great though."
Very poorly made. Never wore it because it's a tight fit around the arms.
"I do not have a big head, but this constantly popped off.  I wasted my money."
I bought a full complete size up and they are still too small. Will not be able to run in them.
"Very cute, wore for my wedding.  Not nearly as comfy as I thought they would be.  I added clear cushions before wedding, but still ended up going barefoot or in soft flats and had blisters on my feet."
I don't wear it as its super scratchy and bothers my neck. it is rather flimsy also. I should have returned it...
Fits as expected. Material is as expected. Image was as expected initially. Horrible fading after first wash. Save your money on this one. I had washed this shirt for the first time along with 4 other Ironman shirts I had just purchased and this was the only one that had any fading. I can understand a little fading but the image was nearly none sustain after the very first wash. Unacceptable.
"Picture shows Blonde Wig clearly modeled after Donald Trump. Upon looking back at the description, I finally noticed it says 'brown' for the color. However, the wig is actually a deep red color, so neither the image not the color description are accurate. False advertising, very disappointed."
"Not big enough when fully opened to put paper bills in. I thought by the dimensions and the pictures, once opened,  I could put my paper money in and not have to fold it over so I had to send this back.  I wanted this for a small cross body bag but it didn't work out for me. I don't need all the plastic slots for cards, I just need a few slots and a place to properly fit paper money."
"I guess I cannot be too surprised at the poor quality of these, based on the price. Put one of them on and it broke immediately. Sometimes you find great buys on Amazon despite the low price. But in this case, you get what you pay for-cheap."
not great small and uncomfortable
"I was a little disappointed with this shirt. The picture shown is clearly of a size Small shirt. I bought size XXXL as it was for a larger person but the santa beard and belt graphic on the front was the same size as what I assume they print on size S. So it was just a small little graphic on the front of this very large shirt, which looked stupid, especially since there's a belt on there which ended up just being a buckle and a tiny piece of the belt strap on either side of it and then it ends abruptly. The shirt itself was thick, heavy cotton - no issues there. But if you're buying a larger size, be aware of the tiny graphic issue.."
Way too big even for an oversized garment.
"I have these exact same shoes in the same size (8), and the two pairs could not fit more differently. The material even feels different. My old pair, which I love, fit perfectly and are very soft. (I bought them at Big 5 Sporting Goods.) The new pair is almost an inch shorter and are made of much a harder material, almost a hard plastic. They both say China on the bottom. So either Crocs is having trouble with consistency (which I've read from several reviews) OR this new pair is a knockoff. Either way, I'm super bummed because I was really hoping to have a backup of my favorite summer sandals."
This shoe was cut bigger than the other two and after a while they start to hurt my feet
The fringe was too heavy and I thought it'd be hot in summer weather. Sent these back.
not a good fabric at all
DO NOT GET THE RED ONE.  It is like the Liberty Bell dressed up as Feddy Kruger for Halloween.  Just awful.  Maybe some of the other colors are better.
It fit to big.
"I normally love Diesel shoes, but this is the worst pair I've owned. The tongue on the left shoe came loose after about a week, and I suspect that it was a manufacturer's defect where the stitches were not properly added. I could probably have them repaired, but what a pain! I should note that I didn't purchase them from Amazon, I got them at The Buckle and had to twist their arm to get a refund."
"Beautiful, but several sizes too small."
"I'm not pleased with this skirt at all. It fits my daughter a full size too big, and the waist is especially huge. There are adjustable tabs inside, but they are located in the back. So once tightened, it makes the back of the skirt look strange. Only the pleats and decorative tabs on the front make it similar to the classic French Toast skirts. Everything is is way off."
"My husband ordered me an xlarge because there were no more larges in stock.  It fits very small.  I am not a big girl but I do wear a large for my very long body, I needed an extra extra long in this"
Once you wash it it gets the furry balls.
"The first one ripped within two months, so we are on to the second. Wouldn't have been so bad, but once you figure in the shipping, these are definitely not worth the price."
"The Seiko box was damaged as if someone dropped it multiple times. When I opened the box, the watch looked like it was used. Scratches behind the watcc, on the band itself, and the second hand doesn't even work. I really hope I get a replacement or a refund because this was absolutely disappointing and it was supposed to be a birthday gift."
Heel is too shallow.
"I choose the size according to the attached size charts, but when I received my purchase, the pocket showed a differente chart size."
Not happy with the quality and fit.
"As other reviewers have said, the bed of the shoe will turn the bottom of your foot black-  and you don't need to get them wet for it to happen.  It washes off, but still not a real selling point for me.  I'd suggest a pass on these."
after 1 wash it shrank.
"My watch came and I was so excited to get it. Unfortunately, when I opened it it had silver unreadable numbers not the easy read ones. Needless to say unhappy with getting something not as pictured. Going back sadly."
Fit was too small and too much trouble to send back
maybe if i has sticks for legs these would work and i'm not even that fat . - .
Retuned as it fit horribly.
Nice frame treble glass . scratch easily and I hated retiurning and get a new one with same result again and again
Order up two sizes
"Ordered two for each of my daughters, and both fell apart within ten minutes.  Horrible.  I'd give it zero stars but I cant."
I like the way these shoes look but they didn't fit in the heel.. .too loose.  I sent back. :-(
Very flimsy and straps came off so soon. I guess you cannot expect much for that price
no padding in foot for a New Balance I was shocked not like any New Balance I have ever bought junky!!
"I bought this belt for my husband. He didn't really like it because it does not look fantastic in real life,and was not wide enough, Though it is a leather belt alright, the size was smaller than expected and I was almost tempted to return it."
"Very cute and made to description, but cheap quality and poorly made. Broke after 1 day of wear, which made my daughter very sad for her bday"
Way too big and so that makes it even floppier. Not the look I was going for.
"Other than waiting forever for it to arrive, the product was not as vibrant and flattering as the picture. My flowers were not radiant pink like shown they were a dark purple and not really well defined (kind of look like blobs not so much roses) The fit was a little off. The garment is see through. Would not suggest."
"I wear a 7.5 and I bought a 7.5 but it fits too big.  The shoe makes it look like I bought too big a size. I don't wear the shoe's at all, will probably donate them to charity."
Horriable!!
"Yikes, unless you're a tiny tiny waif, this isn't going to work out.

I am NOT a tiny waif.

The fabric is GREAT, though. I just literally couldn't get my arms through the armholes!"
"XL is actually a 10 or 12. Be warned. Otherwise the look is nice. Great for tall gals with long arms. Thats a good thing. They should increase sizing so not a waste of time, hope, shipping and money."
"This is a beautiful necklace, which is the only reason I gave it two stars. The piece came broken in half. What a disappointment."
I wear a hard leather CK purse so I thought to buy these since it was heavy and would always lip down my shoulder. Thought the grips would help but the purse continued to fall no matter what I wear with my purse
it definitely has the push up technique down. But it fits small. I'm a 32DD and i weigh 100 pounds. I figure I was a large and it fit like a small. the pattern doesn't really match up with the picture either.
"Had to return these. Despite being the same stated size as my classic Crocs, this shoe is way too small. I couldn't get ether foot inside them!"
Shrinks after a wash tremendously. Also the threading at the bottom is coming undone. One more wash and this shirt will be ruined
"The watch is really large. I have small wrists and it was too large around the dial and too stiff to fit well around my wrist. It was not flush with my skin. Other than that, really nice looking watch, but definitely better for someone with larger wrists."
Im giving it two stars because the colors and design but unfortunately you can not work out or walk without taking back this leggings to your waist. The fabric is poor quality.
I was not impressed by this dress.  It was too tight and I went up 2 sizes.
"I never bought hoop piercings before, so I didn't buy the correct size. I wanted something smaller and fitted closer to my nose. I don't like it at all but that is NOT the sellers fault."
0-3 months and new born is very diff. I got the wrong size..
I liked the color of these jeans but in comparison to the other 3 pair I bought (the same size & style) they ru very small. Sent back for a refund.
The ordered was XXL . It can fit a 10 year old child. The cut of the coat is all wrong. I am not happy with this product. The color is great.
The leather for the laces is dry and will break during tying.
Completely see through after the first wash( black ones) and do not fall from waist as pictured on the model with no hips.  I am beginning to learn that trick with this kind of product. No washing instructions either. Dryed them for kicks and they shrunk up and went see through.
Defiantly not for women over a size 10
"They fit, but I really did not like how all of those ""nubs"" felt on my feet.  I returned them."
Fits very tight instead of a loose fit like advertised. I returns for a refund.
"There isn't anything special about this bra other than it is an unlined front-close bra.  It does not provide any smoothing on the sides or in the back.  I usually buy Front-Close Unlined bras from Soma.com, but they have discontinued this particular bra & I was looking for a replacement.  I hate padded bras!  I usually wear a 40D.  Other reviewers said that the band was tight, so I ordered a 42D.  The Band fit perfectly, but the D cups pooched out at the sides & I was actually swimming in this bra.  I returned it & have ordered a 42C.  We'll see how that works.

I ordered the 2nd bra in a 42C and the bra had the cups sewn in pointing off in weird directions.  This is the last time I'll order from Lilyette.  The bras are very inconsistent and not worth the trouble of reordering & returning them over and over again."
"So darn cute, got a 3x and i am normally a large  and i had to give this coat to my 10 year old daughter.... so disappointed."
its very cute! how ever mine came with a hole in the top right shoulder seam. so will not purchase again.
I used evryday and after two weeks got scratches and stopped working
Had to return due to chain came and had a knot which I could not get out
"There is little to no stretch to this bra. The arm holes are small, very high cut...which would be great for bulge but they are too tight and are borderline painful. I garnet that if I wore this for more than the time it takes to try on, I'd be in pain with irritation and maybe chaffing. The band around the ribs is also small and doesn't stretch. There is no accommodation to this bra and it's beyond uncomfortable and closer to painful. Very disappointed, money is tight but I needed something that would help me nurse. Sad to have wasted the money on something I can't even wear. Ordered a size according to other reviews and size charts :(."
I have genuine quality concerns.
"okay so, this item is incredibly hard to figure out. Took me about two tries to put it on as the picture is shown here. And there is no, no way this fits me. The straps on the lower half are way too small even with the straps adjusted to the longest length. I'm not a big girl, I'm 37""b, 29w, and 36h and this suit cuts into my body making me look like some sort of abstract statue made out of playdough. If that wasn't bad enough, the stitching is just absolutely atrocious. The bows are all frayed and it's not nearly as sexy in person in my personal opinion. The garter straps do not look like the picture.

The only thing good about it is the stockings and that it shipped fast. I will not be using this item, I can't imagine any woman of average size fitting into it either. Please don't bother getting this item! I have ordered other G world things and have liked it but, trust me this is a waste of time if you're not an 24"" hip 0_o"
fell apart almost imediately
Good looking outfit but it didn't fit
"So tiny
I ordered the 30 in for my daughter
Definitely returning
Disappointed!!
Please see photo"
There is a lot of material and there was a rip in the seam after one 30 minutes throw over my swimsuit for a trip to the pool. Had to return.
Fraying of at the seams and lots of loose string. I didn't wear this and returned it right away along with a couple other colors I got this outfit in for the same reason.
"The product description says these fit up to a 4E width. I wear 4E and my feet are swimming in these socks.

In addition, there is a chunky, scratchy seam that goes across the top of the toes. It is very uncomfortable. Why do manufacturers do this? Do they even both trying on products like this to see if they're comfortable or not?"
"Im 56 and 127 lbs and ordered a Medium in Multi-pink. It was so small I couldn't wrap it more than an inch, so it was basically wide open in front.  You need about a 28 inch waist. I have no idea what size to order in exchange because it seems several sizes short of material. Its a beautiful dress and fits in the arms and back and might work as a fancy swim coverup but I wanted a wrap dress. No size tag on dress to very sizing."
didnt' work
TOO small! The 9 was way smaller than the 8.5 that I was wearing when they were delivered. They are so tight!
"For the price - I suppose they are good. But I'm not going to wear them. Maybe if I was just taking pictures of my feet they would be perfect.. but I wanted to wear them around our beach resort and that's just not possible... the chains hang down the sides of the foot so long that I'm dragging them on the ground - but the chain around my ankle is so tight that it's not comfortable. One part is too big, the other part is too small?
My feet are size 8 1/2... not an uncommon size... so unsure why they fit odd.
But, they are super super cute and if you are doing foot photography, they would be perfect!"
I am a size Large and couldn't even get these on even though they are super stretchy.  I would return them but it's probably not cost effective.  They were slightly too big for my 11 year old daughter who is a size 00 or Small.
Not Fit as expected
"Really a very cheap looking ring and the stones do not completely circle the ring.

Looks obviously fake so I returned it."
"As a veteran, I've worn shirt stays for over a decade. These don't cut it. I am 6'2"" and never had an issue with the shirt stays from the base exchange. These stays are too short and too stiff. At about 10"" long, fully extended, they are under full tension and it shows in your shirt. The first time that you sit down, at least one pops off.  On a final note, the ends are heat treated to prevent unraveling and are very sharp and uncomfortable."
just eh...
The shoes fit fine but the heel was so oddly placed that it offered no support for walking. It was as if I was walking on rocks. I sent them back
didn't suite my needs for an off-the-shoulder top. cute is way to slim and fabric is too flimsy.
Heavy material. Too hot for Summer.
"This jacket looks awful. I ordered a medium based on the reviews I read (normally I'm a small)... It's too big in the waist. The fabric is what I can only describe as a comfy sweatshirt / thick yoga pant material, which looks cheap in my opinion. It came with no shipping, receipt, or return information. I didn't expect much at this price point, but I expected more that what I got. Now I have to figure out how to return."
These shoes did not fit right and were  a nightmare to return. I will never order  shoes or sneakers online gain. These shoes costs more to return than they  were worth. The sizes were inaccurately described.
"Advertised as 100% cotton, but the fabric is labeled 90%cotton/10%polyester.

Very annoying."
"I have never purchased this brand before but After reading the reviews I thought I'd give them a try. When you're a DDD/F $25 dollar bra's are hard to come by. I bought the size I normally buy and this was by far too small at the band. I have a bra extender for just these types of predicaments but the extender even at the smallest setting then made the band a little too loose, something I could have lived with if the way they shaped the cups didn't give me torpedo boobs. The last thing I'm looking to do with my hooties is poke someones eye out.  The lace on the outside felt like cheap awful tulle similar to what you find on wal-mart halloween costumes. I ultimately returned it. I bought&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frederick-s-of-Hollywood-NEW-Hollywood-Corset-Lace-Full-Figure-Bra-Womens/dp/B00EVA72XI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frederick's of Hollywood NEW Hollywood Corset Lace Full-Figure Bra Womens</a>&nbsp;at the same time as this bra and recommend it far above this one, it's a better brand, comparable in price, and much more saucy."
"I loved the way this shoe looked. They were very comfortable. Unfortunately, one if them squeaked when I walked, so I returned them."
"Personally, I do not care for the fit of these pants. I say try them out for yourself. they come up high and are not a slim fit. maybe I needed a smaller size but it did not seem that way."
"My 5 year old, who was about to turn 6 the end of May, wanted a Tron themed birthday party. We bought him the costume and ordered the identity disc to complete the look. Well, I was extremely disappointed when the order arrived because it was a bit damaged due to packaging as the material was so flimsy. It is like the material used to make Solo disposable plastic cups. The plan was to have my son pose with disc for a cool picture, but I was so upset I did it even let him see it. I planned on returning them but the company does not offer free returns and the shipping cost would more than likely cost more than the products. They figure more or less the product would be returned damaged, I guess as a result of the material being so flimsy, so they suggest I pay the extra in postage in order to ensure I get my fund. To make matters worse, we accidentally ordered 2 discs so now I am stuck with 2....definitely not worth it!!!!"
JUST TOO SMALL AND NARROW
Way smaller than advertised...
"This is not what I expected from the picture and description. They are an ugly pair of glasses, I selected Black in color and the arms are Gold Color, very cheap looking and big, I look like a fly in them, I gave them to my young daughter to have and she doesn't want them either."
"Cute but very rigid and heavy. Not comfortable.
2 stars for the look."
"I bought these in the pewter metallic color. The shoe looks very cute but there is absolutely no support, padding, or cushion when you walk. I would recommend that you buy your true size and add some cushy air pillow insoles. I can barely use these shoes."
This shirt is not silk its hot feel more wool
The boots are cute. The buckles on the side are flimsy and will break. Literally broke the first time I tried them on. The customer service is very poor with this company and I haven't been able to process a return with them. Wouldn't purchase again.
The lace part is cheaply sewn onto the dress.  Looks very cheap up close
Many clothes threadNeedlework missingVery poorVery disappointed
The dress I received looked nothing like the dress advertised; you can clearly see that in the bodice detail of the attached comparison photo. So disappointed. I immediately requested to return it (it took some time since the company is in China).
Returned this item because it was so awful. I ordered a large and could not even get the jacket on. The tag said large but there's no way this was anything a stitch larger than a small. Even if it was a medium I would have been able to fit. I just wanted it to be baggy and larger. Super disappointed.
Granddaughter didn't like the chain
"I have not worn these shoes.  The color is not what I wanted.  It advertised orange but, it more of a coral color"
"I had a pair before that was identical to this one and those fit fine.  It turns out that these (even though listed as medium) are wide and pretty large, flopping on my feet when I walk.  I do not understand how one can buy a prior pair that fit fine and then get a second pair in the same size and those be too large and too wide!  I paid a lot of money for these, but am dissatisfied with how they fit."
Cheap quality and they are way to small.  No stretch at all.
Cheap look and feel. Not happy with this shirt.
Thong part of flip flop broke and cause me to trip out of it-after only about four wears. Return policy is awful-30 days..i am over the 30 days by 5 days. ..theyre going in the trash will not purchase again!
These are not a good purchase because the screw backs are so small they are impossible to screw on.  I tried to screw  the backs on for proably 20 minutes before giving up.  Very disappointed because I purposely bought these for every day wear.
"I thought that this shoe would be my answer in lieu of wearing heels during the fall...it's not.  It is extremely hard, doesn't bend, uncomfortable instep...I'm returning it!"
I actually couldn't even get my foot in it. I take size 6 US and 36 EUR and have never had a problem before.
This is the ugliest thing in the world. I feel like I could be a pirate. It just doesn't look anything like in the picture. Very disappointed.
"This dress made of nice thick fabric. I ordered this dress but it was too, was hoping to just replace it with a bigger size but the only option I got from the seller was to get a refund and that's disappointing."
i found wallet too small for use for my needs. it could not hold all items from my original billflod
I dunno who makes these shoes.  But having a sole that's 15 percent of the width of the actual shoe is ridiculous.  I ordered a size 13 and I don't know anyone that has a 13 with and extra narrow width .  Doesn't make sense. I put my foot in it and it looked like the shoe was ready to explode
Cheap material. Not denim. Feels like stretchy itchy spandex. Bell bottom is too exaggerated. Did like how high rise they were. Returned. Not worth the price.
"I can't wear these any longer, if I do then I might run the risk of strangulating a testicle or two."
"Very disappointed,  will be sending it back. Voice is hard to understand,  especially for my elderly mother. The band pinches also."
"These flips were pretty cheap looking, not what I expected.  The picture makes them look higher quality!"
"Looks terrible on me, they are so tiny that it was embarrassing just trying them on. I am a fairly small girl, I wear a size small, dress and jeans size 0-4.... pretty sad about it."
This purse is soooo thin. I will not be able to put anything heavy in it the straps will break off. You get what you pay for...
"After having read the reviews, I purchased 2 sizes  up from the large I regularly wear..... and it was way too small .... the size chart is way off ..... too bad because I really liked the look and softness ...."
They were smaller than expected. I'll be giving them to my goddaughter.
It's not that they were too small. They are just cut so badly that walking in them at all would prove extremely uncomfortable. I sent them back.
"They claim it is 925 silver, well it it is not. I had to sent it back, first time worn it faded to a black metal. The description is not true, don't get fooled."
My daughter chose to be Super Why for Halloween so I went ahead and ordered this costume. Awful. Not only is it poorly  made AND doesn't look as pictured.. it had a brown stain on the front of it when I pulled it out of the package. I am sending this back and MAKING a costume for her. I can't send my kid out in this piece of trash.
Okay glasses. They look okay on I think because my face is not round enough for size though my face is round. These  glasses also do not block the sun at all. They only work if the sun is not too bright.
Timely delivery and great price but the zipper closed only half way up the leg.  This particular style is not for those with shapely calves.  I had to return them.
"The fit is nice, but these shirts are completely see through. They also shrunk and somehow the material bunched to the side after the first wash and air drying, so the ""V"" section is now more towards my hip."
Lovely but began to fall apart within two weeks both in the seams and the sole.
The fit of the tank is not as pictured. It's more of a men's style tank with tubbing around the edges. Not what I expected. But print was ok
You can get these at the dollar store save your money
Not good. Soles wore out after 6 mos.  Not worth it.. Stitching came undone on the front of the shoe.
"The lift part needs to be made of the same material as the pasties, but neither lays flat enough for thinner fabric tops. I wasn't really thrilled with the quality. The lifts didn't really lay on the skin well at all."
"I am giving this product 2 stars because although it looks as described, there is an overpowering chemical smell, like a plastic solvent, emanating from the material. I have a definite concern about how healthy this is to wear against the skin, which absorbs what it touches."
I thought this was going to be so cute. It wasn't it was so huge it engulfed my ear and sat weird.
fits perfect. Also super comfortable I use it almost every day for about 4 to 8 hours.the only negative that I have to say is that this material is stretching a little bit and I looks like it's fading out otherwise great product. This is an update all of the product . I purchased it in April . now the inside ripped am  is poking me . I got it about  one months and less it two weeks . Don't buy it.
"cheap feel, but I guess for the price I shouldn't be so surprised."
"Standard size runs small & although the colour is right, the criss-cross material that appears in the front part of the costume is actually in the back."
"Width is perfect, but length of shoe is too long for a size 10.  Feels more like a size 11."
"Updated Review:  this WAS my favorite shirt. It's soft and the design is high quality. But I came to find that even though I wash all my shirts on cold, gentle cycle and hang dry- this shirt and only this shirt, still managed to shrink. It's so short it looks ridiculous. I had to retire it to the pajama drawer and I've only had it a couple months. Super bummed about it."
WAS NOT BLUE AT ALL!
My kid is petite and these shirts were way too wide and long. Better suited for larger children. Returned.
I didn't expect to lose the top two buttons by the end of the FIRST DAY WEARING IT!
"You can get worse shoes, but you'll have to try hard.

The Wave - Mens Aqua Shoe is a great way to protect your feet while swimming in the ocean or river.

That's about the only good thing I can say about these shoes.  Horrible for any type of land use, sole falls apart and leaves bits of black rubber everywhere you go, insole slips and makes an uncomfortable shoe unbearable, and after brief use the shoe starts to fall apart.  I used them one day, both in fresh water and salt water, and was glad to throw them out afterwards.

Don't get me wrong...they did their job, and I was glad for that.  Two stars for cheap shoes that protected my feet, but there are better shoes out there for water use that deserve 3 or more stars."
Not colors shown on original photo
Super cute and for the price it was worth it. A few days in some of the rhinestones fell out and then the dangles started breaking off.
The cut is extremely small and the quality isn't the best.  It's also pretty annoying not to be able to put them in the dryer.
"Very small, ordered a 10 ad it feels like an 8."
Very disappointed and was returned.
I was eager to recieve it but after 2 calls to Amazon Customer Service it never arrived. Full refund of course!
"The good:

Quick delivery and the hat looks nice and it's actually is made in Greece.

The bad:

The quality isn't that great.
Examples are that it has a staple instead of being sown together in the back.
Also it has a card board looking (cheap quality) piece that hold the hat in shape. With moisture that won't hold up.

Also ""large size 7 3/8"" is larger than other hats that are 7 3/8"" and so if you can't find a similar hat made by Scala and must buy this look then be careful about sizing."
"Love everything about these boots except that they are made for a yeti.  I'm a normal-sized person (5'8"" tall, wear a size 4-6 pants, size 8.5 shoe) and I have approximately 2"" of room in the leg of these boots.  I mistakenly kept them thinking that ""it's not so bad"" and ""maybe with jeans they're ok,"" but the truth is, it looks like I'm a little girl playing dress-up in mom's boots."
"I should  have known that the NB's would be one size to small, I wear an 11.5 in Nike, 11.5 in adidas, sometimes in Reebok an 11, Timberland an 11. The only bad thing is AMAZON doesn't have the 11. 5. I had to order from Backcountry instead."
Cute bag but I wish it was bigger.
"Serious lines from these hipsters. The lace waistband is very cheap and rolls over on itself. I ordered the same size as the Bali hipsters I bought several years ago and these were snug. So my advice, if you are determined to get them despite my warning,  is to order these at least one size larger than the size chart indicates, and don't be surprised if you end up with panty lines anyway."
Disappointed....
I don't know what to do with this item.  My Wedding is on June 10th.  I'm afraid to order a smaller size and not get it on time.  Does not look like the one on line.  Cheap material.
"I got two pairs in the past year. At first I love the style and fit of them. However after several months, the color starts to peel off from the frames like pieces of plastic wraps."
"I received these shoes about 5 weeks ago, and have yet to wear them.  The chemical odor (think kerosene) is very strong. I've kept these shoes outside on my porch, hoping the odor would go away.  They still smell just as awful as ever.  Other reviewers mentioned the odor, but I decided to order the shoes anyway because I don't have a particularly sensitive nose.  I should not have ignored those comments.  This is a very cute shoe, but something this stinky has to be a health hazard and  should not be sold in the U.S..

Order update:  Ordered these shoes Sept2014, it is now April2015.  Never wore them... too stinky.  Put them out with the trash today."
runs very  small
It can ripped along the seam all the way up the side.  Very cheaply made  I am giving this 2 stars instead of 1 because they did give me my money back but it was a hassle because they do not take returns
"Not good quality, when I put them on I see little elastic bands all over them."
"I returned this dress as it was too thin and showed undergarments easily. It would have shown the outline of the slip as well and I wasn't keen to follow other reviewers' advice of not wearing undergarments to make it look good. :-/

Aside from being thing, it fit as expected and was very flattering."
Beautiful watch. This watch is VERY large and heavy. I could not make the metal clasp fully lock in place and the band kept opening allowing the watch to fall around my hand.
"They're going back.  My foot measures a 6.5, but I have wide feet and and high arch.  So I ordered 7.5 C/D width and can barely get my foot in the shoe. The toe box is also very small.  I like my toes completely covered.  They look a little cheap also."
Very disappointed. I need a 20x magnifier to read the words. Not worth the price
"Very bad quality, it smelled awfully of chemicals and left color on my hands."
"My husband loved these. They look nice & were comfortable for boating, etc. But apparently our 60 lb dog stepped on the back of the flip flip while he was wearing them and the sandal ripped in 1/2. Pretty disappointing. Now he's stuck wearing $7 flip flops from CVS until I can find him a new pair. Thanks, Reef."
will make a good rag
I ordered my regular size which is 6 and my foot barely fit into the boot. Too narrow and small all around. Boots were pretty but not well built.
"I like the fit and look, but unfortunately my first order was defective.  The strap on the right shoe was at least one inch shorter than the left one.  The left one felt fine, but the right one did not.  I returned them and have ordered another pair in hopes that the new pair will not be defective.  Would have given it four stars if the straps had been the same size.  There just doesn't seem  to be any quality control anymore and this is usually a good brand."
At least 2 sizes to small.
This is a really cheap looking costume. We take Halloween and especially pizza paraphernalia really seriously at our house and this costume did not live up to our high expectations. Wouldn't buy again or recommend this product.
It's a nice light jacket. However I usually wear a size small and I ordered a medium and the medium wouldn't zip over my size D breasts. Seeing as how I would like to wear a sweater under it I gave the medium away and ordered an x large so it runs small for sure
Super thin and larger clasp so not what I needed
Definitely not a professional length. It's super tight and short.
"This scarf looks nice in the photo, but the quality is very poor. It is nearly see through. A complete waste of money."
"I love the way these boots look and they're obviously well made of quality leather, but the quality is too good. By that I mean that the weather is so stiff it won't bend, the boots way and astronomical amount and are incredibly heavy on my feet. They are the least comfortable thing I've ever put on my feet and that includes snowboarding boots, ski boots, and pointe shoes. I'm so disappointed to have paid so much money for this well known quality brand of boots when they are the most uncomfortable thing I own, and after almost one year of trying to wear them, I still can't wear them for more than 10 minutes. Save your money get something more comfortable even if it doesn't last as long."
Expensive and did not last long enough. Do Not Buy
"Beautiful product, so long as you never wash it! It's shrinks, even though it claims to be preshrunk. I attempted to return it and the seller refused to take it back because it was washed. I will never buy from them again."
Too big for my taste. Was hoping more for a Lennon look.
Hate them. Good concept though. If you truly have large thighs these don't work.
Was fine at first but I only got to wear it once and it got tangled and broke.
"WAY too large - marked size 0, but fit like a 2 or even a 4.  Very disappointed.  The jeans are gorgeous otherwise - so if you are larger than me, don't hesitate! Just order a size smaller than you usually do."
"I'm 5' 9"" and 160 pounds and I always wear medium shirts.  I ordered this in black Large/US Medium and charcoal gray in X-Large/US Large.  The Large/US Medium was a nice slim fit, the gray a little big.

I liked how it looked and felt, but there were loose threads all over the black shirt.  Almost snapped some threads that were loose and got caught around two buttons.  The charcoal gray one had several buttons almost fall off while I was unbuttoning the shirt to try it on.  The threads on the buttons were so loose that they practically came off entirely.

I would definitely have kept one or both shirts, but it feels like really sloppy craftsmanship and poor quality"
larger than anticipated and did not like the material
Too small. They should really figure this out already. Would not recomend
"This is a sparkly-awesome ring for the price.  The stones are good-sized and have great clarity.  My only complaint is that the poor cut of the stones results in a central window where, when looking down on the stones, the wearer's skin is seen.  Sadly returned it."
"Disappointed that within 2 years, the watch failed. The Watch Battery people tried, but said it needs to be rebuilt.
[And my wife so LOVED the design, even the larger face.]
SO Disapointed !!"
"I ordered 2 pair in the rinsed color, they have a very strong chemical odor that only got stronger after washing them. I am returning them."
sleeves were puffy and the neckline was sloppy - I will not buy this shirt again
"Looks good, but runs very tight.  Watch out for the dryer!!  should lay this jacket out damp to dry!!!!  Still small"
Beautiful.  Stunning.  Broke on first day. Beads went everywhere.  Not meant for big wrists.
I loved the dress color and fabric but it runs small and doesn't come with matching straps only clear
A piece of junk.
"Seriously, this purchase is the final chance I am giving to a company which, once upon a time, made superb footwear.

I purchased three pairs of 1460s (which were then made in England) in my late teens and early twenties, all of which I beat the hell out of. One pair lasted me two years as a laborer for a plumbing outfit I... labored for. Not bad considering they aren't a true work boot. One pair lasted me five, FIVE, years in the food service industry. That's five years of walking miles and miles a day for fifty to sixty hours a week. Astonishing. The last pair, which were my casual go-to in the beginning of their life, finally gave up the ghost two years back after long ago being relegated to the miscellaneous handy man/painting/I-don't-care-what-happens-to-these spot. They were at least eight years old. Wow.

After Dr. Martens ceased large scale production in England, I have purchased three pairs, these Harlows being number three. The first pair took almost a month to break in, but once they were, they were really comfortable. Until the sole split down the middle after only having them for four months. Hmmm... Well, I chalked it up to a fluke, and order another pair shortly thereafter. This pair was sub-Walmart GARBAGE. The ""leather"" started cracking after five or six weeks of wear, and...whatever, they were trash. I held off for a few years and then I spied these while browsing. Price was okay, they looked like what I wanted, and here we are, about a month in. First impressions were good - the leather seemed a good deal thicker than the last two East Asian pairs I got, so I took no chances and Lexoled the bejesus out of them. After many doses of a good conditioner, they got ultra supple, and really formed to my foot, and, after the addition of an actual insole, they were like walking on air . They reminded me of the old pairs I had fifteen years ago. And they have a kinda pseudo-flannel lining which adds an extra bit of warmth, which is nice to have in Wisconsin. The stitching is sound, the soles seem solid yet flexible, the eyelets don't pop off while you're walking - they are a complete one-eighty from the last two pairs. If all goes well, I may look into buying another pair down the road. If not, sadly, then I'm done with a company which I once loved; a company that used to make a quality product.

My only twp gripes are a) the laces are a joke, so you best buy a decent pair to replace the ones that will break almost immediately, and b) for $130 list, I expect an insole. Not a super-dee-duper space age technology orthopedic wundersole, but something. ANYTHING. C'mon.

All in all, I'm very happy with them and I hope to remain so.

Edit: 12.20.14

Guys, you blew it.

After not even two months of casual, almost exclusively indoor wear, the stitching is coming undone at the heel and where the vamp meets the upper (which boggles my mind because it is triple-stitched - how is that even possible?). And I babied these things, man. They were kept clean, conditioned and waterproofed. I even used shoes trees in them several times a week. The only reason for two stars is that they are very comfortable, but that's not gonna matter once the stitching deteriorates, is it?

Well, I'll still wear them until the end, whenever that may be, but never again will I purchase another Dr. Martens product. I should've spent the extra thirty bucks and got that pair of Chippewas I was eyeing.

See ya, Doc."
"I saw some reviews that these run small, so I ordered a size up. It's supposed to be 14/16 which I was hoping would fit like a 10/12 in other brands but it's as small as a size 7 or 8 shirt that my child is about to outgrow. I don't know if they all run this small or if they have put the wrong size labels on some of the shirts, but I am hesitant to buy this brand again the future. It also has an odd smell that has not come out in the wash so far. The colors would be nice if it wasn't for the sizing issue."
"Disappointed - when ordered it indicated M was 34-36, but the item received said M 32-34.....so now he has to go to the hassle of returning"
Most of the time large is just right or a little loose this was tight and it tore
"Seem fine, but too small.  Asked for a return before the window closed, but the return never process.ed"
This item shrink a lot
"I bought this as a gift, and overall it looks nice, but the face is a PRINTED WOODEN DESIGN. Not actual wood. I was really disappointed to see that. I don't know how it's held up, I'm just not thrilled with the face."
Returned.  Looked like a tent.
It's very lightweight and thin. Sizing is also very big for me.
"These very nice sandals are too short.  The strap on the back doesn't even go around my foot.  The sole is the correct length.  If I get a larger size, the sole will be too long and cause problems from tripping."
Sizing is incorrect in these boots. I wear a women's 11 which is what I ordered. I tried them on without socks and my toes hit the end of the boot.. There should be at least a half inch for wiggle room to allow for socks. In addition to the sizing issue they have a very strong chemical smell. I will be returning these.
Very thin material and runs smaller than the Hanes which is a bette product!
I've worn size 12 for 35 years and this is the first pair of size 12 that don't fit. They look like nice shoes though.
I am returning the dress because it's too small.  I will reorder larger size.  Love the fabric.
like freakin' jncos with a huge pappy o'daniel inseam.
Not very soft material. The grey is actually like an off white kind of beige color.
Built for a bigger hipped woman and can't adjust down.  I'm a size 6 jean.  Otherwise good for bigger hips.
"Very,  very uncomfortable"
"yuck shrink after first wash, no wonder they are so cheap"
"They have an elastic band in the middle of the foot that fits so tight that they are uncomfortable to wear, and I purchased the largest size. I have never had a pair of socks that were made that way before. I need to return them."
"Do not order if you expect these to fit.  I usually wear a 22/24 in tops, so ordered a 3x - these fit more like a Large (way too small).  The fabric was stiff.  Instead of these, have a look at the Joe's USA, Dickies or Lee's polo shirts.  I've found all three of those to be a better fit and way softer."
"I love these pajamas, but I have now had two pairs sent to me with quality issues.  The first one had a nick cut into the band of the neckline trim and the second had the same thing plus a big hole in one of the pockets.  I am giving this company one last try because I really like the fabric and the style.  My fingers are crossed."
don't like where the adjustment thing is
Did not like the material but it worked well with the garment.
"There's something about the cut of the toe box on this shoe that just kind of ruins it for me.  It looks very ""old lady"" on your foot (sorry old ladies out there!) and I'm sending it back."
"I agree with the previous review about the boots being vinyl. I bought another pair of Nine West, all leather, just a few dollars more. Worst yet, these boots will not go over my legs, the shaft is too small.
The boots are so shiny, and looks very cheap."
"I don't care for this shaper.  It is not particularly high-waisted... it comes to just 2 inches above my belly button and it rolls down almost immediately. It is slick feeling, as others have stated, but pant legs still cling to it.  Also, there's a seam up the inside of the legs and you need to be careful to keep it positioned correctly.  It's a thick fabric that gets hot during wear.  It is made well, though, and the thick fabric won't snag or run easily.  For comparison, I am 5'3"", 135lbs, size 6 pants, and I ordered S/M and it fits well in the legs and butt, but does nothing for muffin top."
I'm a medium so I bought a large.  Still too small.  It pinches around your stomach and gives you a muffin top.  The thighs roll up too .... It's a good idea but I can't seem to get the sizing
Comfortable but buy a size bigger
These were HUGE looking when on your face and very poorly made.
"I bought this since there's a high stars reviewed on it.  Item is too large, especially at the breast area.  Even those, I'm a size DD the breast area still too loose.  Disappointed.  Can't use it.  Will not buy this again ever."
Easy to use but the clips are in the way when nursing. Watch baby's eye and skin.
"This dress feel like paper very cheaply made. The size run large. I am normally an XL and or size 16.. I know all costume run small so I ordered plus size. And, this dress is true to size and a bit too large."
Nivel but to small
Battery lasted 2 months from when I got it.
Not as much support as I thought it would be
This bracelet broke after the first time wearing it. I am very disappointed.
weird having zippers on both sides
"The size didn't fit me as expected, and the color didn't satisfied me too."
MATERIAL IS NOT THE SAME FOR COLORED PURSES. BLACK ONE IS PERFECT
Nope don't like them. Return if could but missed deadline.  Goodwill pile
The material is really cheap as well as the elastic. For the price I could have purchased  something with more support at Target.
Watch was scratch had the wrong instructions couldn't set it all the way a bad choice
Broke right after I opened this box.
"We returned them, they were very narrow."
"I want to love this dress, but the quality of it isn't the best. The belt that comes with it doesnt seem to match the style of the dress even though in the picture, it looks perfect. Because it came from China, it took a very long time to arrive in the mail so returning it would seem like more of a hassle to me than trying to find another belt to pair it with. I also don't like that in person, the off-white bib on the top appears to be a very dingy-yellow whereas the picture makes it look much brighter. Sadly, I would say that this dress isn't worth the money or the time it takes to arrive."
The right thigh of the pant is smaller that the left and the entire front top area pulls to the right.  It's extremely uncomfortable and looks to be made poorly.  The seller emailed me to ensure I was happy - I told them I was not about 3 days ago and have not heard back. Sucky pants and sucky customer service.
THE UPPER PORTION OF THE SHAPEWEAR SEEM TO BE TRUE TO SIZE BUT THE OPENING IN THE LEGS ARE WAY TO BIG !! THE HOOKS AND EYES IN THE CROTCH AREA FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE AND HARD TO OPEN WHEN YOU HAVE TO USE THE RESTROOM QUICKLY
"These are very pretty, but got scratched terribly the first time I travelled with them.
My second trip the wheel fell off.
Pretty but not practical"
Had to return didn't fit Runs small Seemed to be good product
"I purchased this for my daughter. This is by no means a full size backpack. Which is ok. Within 4 hours of opening the box, both of the zipper pulls broke off of the zippers. Maybe I had my expectations a little too high, but zippers, really? I would expect the handle to break before the zippers."
Darn near unwearble. I enjoy barefoot running in vibram 5 fingers so I figured I'd give these a shot. After a 3 mile ruck today both of my Achilles tendons have some pretty wicked blisters and are rubbed raw. This is not my first time wearing them and I have worn them often around the shop in which they were uncomfortable as well.... they're going to a goodwill this weekend.
"Something interesting: I got these boy shorts in black and yellow. The black ones are perfect, the yellow ones lost its shape quickly. They look ugly now. They kind of lost all shape. If I order again I might order them in black again. I wonder why this happened...."
If you like small purses this is the one its very stylish but too small
"It is not as cool as it looks in the picture and this jacket is HUGE! My boyfriend is a medium/large. I had my doubts of what size to buy, but even if it was too big I was thinking of just giving it to my brother who is much larger. This jacket could fit a small family inside it. The material looks very cheap. Even if it did fit, I still would have returned it."
Nothing like photo awful
"I'm a big guy, so I ordered 46 x 32.  Holy crap, once I got them and put them on, it was like wearing two skirts sewn together.
They were huge.  The loose fit is obviously more for thin guys to have loose.
I threw them away and went and found Wrangler work khaki's in my size."
"...than in real life, or on your wrist.

I'm sure it's an accurate and reliable timepiece as all Seikos tend to be, but I just had to send mine back.  Really disappointing, because I have been looking for a nice BLACK metal watch for under $200 for a long time now, and jumped at the Kinetic movement (no batteries!) and Seiko reliability.

Unfortunately, I didn't realize just how distractingly and distressingly RED the rotating bezel is, and also as another reviewer pointed out, there is a fundamentally WEIRD or OUT OF WACK sense of scale between the overall huge size of the watch case and the tiny, almost dainty, size of the actual dial and hands.  In a nutshell, when worn on my wrist it looks like two watches in one: a huge honkin' clunky men's diving watch, with a dainty women's watch inside of it.

Build quality is excellent, and I liked the weight and heft of this watch.  But sorry, it's just butt FUGLY, if you ask me.

I strongly suggest you go find this watch in a shop and try it on first, before ordering online.  I was very fortunate to have ordered it from a website with a decent return/refund policy...whew!"
Not what I had hoped for.  The straps are tight and I still get baggy knees
"Very disappointed, very low quality! Not recommend to anyone."
"Cheap and not well made, plus after paying shipping I had to pay more postage to get on delivery"
Very uncomfortable.  Not well made.
First off I ordered a size 3xl and it fits like a small large or even a medium. The fabric is very see through. Overall not very happy with it
"This is an exceptional Belt but way too small the lenght of the belt itself, in the other hand the belt is so nice and exceeded my expectations"
"Admittedly, I love Nine West.  I wanted to like this bag.  But it has such a flat shape, that even a lip balm or small set of keys makes it awkward and bulky.  Also, it's a cross body, but as soon as you open the front clasp, the whole thing just opens right up! Like, falls down and open.  Really weird.  And there are two zippered compartments, but regardless of what you put into it, and which pocket you put it into, it just makes it bulky.  If you plan on carrying anything more than flat cards and cash bills, this is not the bag for you."
Awful quality. Fabric is too thin and stretchy and there is zero support in the front causing the zipper to show. The sizing felt right but they looked terrible on. I've donated both pairs that I bought.
Burst easy
"Where do I begin....  I bought it as part of my work attire.  I am a short woman, 5' 3"", and the shirt was way too short to tuck the tails in.  The material is absolutely cheap and ultra see-through.  It had the feel and appearance of a rough handkerchief.  This shirt should not cost half of what it is priced at.  Sending it back."
"Returned shoes, did not have an adequate substitute, too small also."
I love the print . However cut is too small at the waist for me.
I have wide feet so I purchase mens shoes often because of that. These are narrower than most.
Strap broke while trying it on for the first time! Poor workmanship!
"Nice shoe, just runs small. I sent back."
"very cheap, thin, terrible material. worst quality i've ever seen in a halloween costume! this would even stand up to a night of trick or treating."
"This thing is not for a women with a booty or body lol......it's definitely made for the more athletic lady's.......does not fit at all, but it did come in a nice little pink reusable hand bag."
i ordered 71/2 -81/2  got 91/2 101/2 way to big but like the shoe just can't keep it on.
"Horrible cheaply made shirt!  I ordered three and sent them all back. The sizing is strange and based on the reviews and size information I ordered a size up, the shirts were so long they could have been dresses!"
"Alas, Crocs has designed a good looking flat sandal that unfortunately misses the mark with difficulty keeping this shoe on as you walk.  It slips off and requires strenuous toe clenching action to keep it on your foot.  Come on Crocs, please design a flat sandal that stays on, and doesn't make your foot sweat.  The Patricia 2 wedge style fits great, looks good, stays on, but your foot sweats.  Oh so close indeed.... HT"
Too stiff and bulky for LO.  Had to get something less heavy until he's older maybe.
I had to return these because the fit was much larger than the other Kanu shorts. Too bad as I thought the pattern was cute.
"Though I wear a New Balance 928, these were smaller at the same size.  Liked the velcro though it was too short.  I recommend you try these in a store."
Huge boxy fit.  Probably two sizes too big
Very much larger than it should've been. I had to send them back because it would've been a guessing game for them to fit.
"Let's be honest.  This shoes is made of man-made materials.  That being said, we need to understand that the shoes would not feel or breath like a pair made from leather  ---  but the incredible lack of ""breathability"" is insane.  It's like your feet are trapped in Saran Wrap.  The uppers are going to show their plastic base sooner than later with visible creases being apparent after the first day of wear.  I can't believe that these are actually ""M"" width, I feel like my foot is flopping around no matter how tight I tie the laces."
Well I didn't get the same size top and bottom but from the looks of the bottom it doesn't matter what size I get it wouldn't fit any girls body and cover correctly so I didn't reorder. We will wear the top with another set of bottoms we have. I've already thrown them away.
These shoes looked better in the picture than on my feet.  The color is flat and cheap looking.  I am returning them.
sizing was not he same
Clarks run super narrow & were never able to break in enough to wear
Not pleased with the quality....size is somewhat small
Not for tweens...
"These are the most ill fitting pants. They are too small around the wasteband, then way too baggy in the legs."
The skirt I purchased and the one I received are completely different. Mine did not come with a bow attached at all. The hem on the skirt is uneven. Definitely not flattering. Highly disappointed in this because I was really hoping to wear it for Valentine's Day.
Even though these are labeled as wide calf they are not. Lovely leather but I had to return them.
"The fit was smaller than expected. I gave it 2 stars, however, the dress itself was absolutely beautiful."
"These are just ok. I'm only 5' 10.5"" but the medium longs are still a bit short. I certainly wouldnt put them in the dryer. Also for the price point, the quality isn't terrific. I'm already getting pilling after 1 day of thighs brushing together on a walk. And my thighs don't touch that much!  I miss Target's C9 pants that were similar but thicker and better quality."
"As others have noted, the sizing on these shoes is way off. I have been wearing 10M for a long time and every other shoe in 10M, including other Rockports,  fit correctly.
There is no way these shoes are a 10M. They are entirely too tight as to barely being able to get them on my feet.
I am returning them for a refund.
They are very light shoes and appear to be well made, but can not recommend due to the size problem."
I loved these shoes- they are so cute and the price was right but when they came they were way too small! I am always a size seven but I could barely get my foot in these. They also had a very strong smell. A 7.5 wasn't available so now I'm just out of luck which stinks!
"Broke while wearing for first time  Walking in grocery store, full cart, ankle twisted, much embarrassment.  Threw the bitches in the trash and finished shopping while barefoot.  Too bad, because these sandals are otherwise super cute and comfortable.  Do not buy unless you enjoy public humiliation."
"I think it's a great sandal, but the straps hit my feet in weird places."
"Oh, it fits alright, as long as I don't move.
If you are looking for a bra that does not ride up over your boobs every time you move your arms, then don't buy this one."
"I read this same comment by other buyers and should have taken heed, but I needed the item and thought I'd be safe selecting mid-range price rather than the absolute least expensive. Not so! The turnpiece or ""handle"" broke on these in exactly the same way people describe across price ranges. Waste of money, just about the only thing I've bought from Amazon so far that was."
"These gloves are made for women with tiny hands and narrow fingers. The gloves barely fit over my hand, and my hand is average size. Only buy these fir small women, cause they will be only ones who can fit them.  I ended up giving them to a friend."
This shoe is terrible!! Looks like a clown shoe on. Very Wide and sloppy! Had to return!!!
"I am very disappointed. The stones are pale green and do not look like emeralds; and certainly not like the stones in the photo on Amazon.com. They look like cut glass to me. Also they are flimsy. Very light and thin gold. Maybe that is all you get for over $100 but I am just so disappointed,and will return them."
very cheap looking shoe.....going back :(
"This product would have received 5 stars except that after one washing a hole developed. Very disappointed.

The one time I wore it I loved it."
i liked the material but it fit like a size med
"These are just okay. I have a very similar pair from CuddlDuds that I bought through a different website that are much thicker and substantial. This pair is thin (prone to static) and feels ""cheap"". I'd buy CuddleDuds again, but not from here."
"I'm 5'5"" and 115. The small was too small. Even the medium, tried on over a fairly lightweight ght hoodie, didn't leave much room. And wow--so thin!  I can't see how this could do a whit to keep me warm. Returning."
"Terrble, 1 week and the faux leather is broken.
Cheap."
the linning not soft enough - felt sharp so returned.
"Very cheap and tacky looking, it was stringing when I received it. I was so upset because I purchased it for a first date and had to purchase a whole new dress. I am highly disappointed "
color is WAY off from the pic
Terribly fitted suite! Vest is short shirt is huge and ends up looking sloppy not classy.
Soft cotton but kind of floppy. The brim doesnt stay up and we constantly have to fold it up.
These are pretty terrible socks
It already fell out and it's lost. Record time.
Returned. Way too see through for white scrubs.
"Believe the reviews - this is not a wide shoe. And it is heavy.  I am a Personal Trainer and runner.  I am on my feet no less than 8 hours a day between working and my own work outs.  I had bunion revision surgery in March on my left foot (bone was cut, moved, plated and screwed in, and the soft tissue shaved off that creates the hideoous lump on the side of the foot).  My foot is almost straight, but still a little swollen so a wide shoe is my best bet.  But not these.  Measured width wise against an old pair of Asics Nimbus, the Ariel is a half inch more narrow.  And my baby toe hit right against a seam.  I made it through an hour and then took the shoes off and wore the old ones to the gym.  This shoe is available in a double EE and while I could have tried it, I ordered the Mizuno Women's Wave Rider 19 at the same time and it seems to be a good fit.  The Ariel did not feel particularly good on my right foot either.  For what it's worth, the new Asics Nimbus 18 is also cut more narrow in the D (I had worn this style for years).  I will review the Mizuno separately."
Does not fit.  Extremely small.  Runs very small.
"the bag itself was sooo beautiful in fact i love it so much. I carried this bag for one day and the handle nails started falling out didn't carry it again. as hard as i tried to screw them back in, the bag could not even stay intact. i hated it that i had to buy it just to waste my money. it was so painful because i loved my bag so much"
"THESE GLASSES AND PARTICULARLY THE LENSES SEEMED REALLY SMALL. ALSO, I DID NOT THINK THEY WOULD LAST.
VERY LONG, DID NOT SEEM STURDY."
"My wife normally wears a large, but ordered an extra large to be safe. This dress fits but is very tight to the point that it would be inappropriate for her to wear to work. The shiny material is a bit odd and would not be comfortable to wear regularly."
SOOOO misrepresented. These are sized for a very small Asian woman or a junior. Very irritating having to return things. Glad we have Prime.
These didn't fit my athletic shoes.  I gave them to a relative with a toddler.  Maybe they will fit her shoes instead of mine.
Broke in a couple days but I honestly wasn't surprised.  It was a valentine's day gift for my son's girlfriend and he needed a cheap gift.
never saw shoes that narrow shoes are the hardest thing online
Short and very wide. Probably end up being a Jammie shirt.
At first I loved the boots. Went to wear them yesterday and a the thread on side had come loose and now has a big hole. I have had the boots less than a month. Not worth the money!
This product is thin and cheap...very Walmart. I returned. Disappointed in burts bees
Very uncomfortable material. Returned immediately.
The stitching came loose after the first washing.
"Cute, but fell apart after being washed once."
"don't buy this product. you won't be happy. I am 90 lbs at 5'2"" and I should have order an extra large to even be able to slip it on. The material is very cheap and the strings - I couldn't figure them out to save my life. Good luck trying to find hose that will attach to this THING! Bad mistake on my part ordering. I would not have taken it even if they gave it to me free. SO BUYER BEWARE! 5.00 to ship it also. It could have been put in a reg, envelope that is how tiny it is.."
This was a very uncomfortable shoe.  The material was stiff. I returned it
"dockers and their sweatshop labor products are getting increasingly worse and worse. stay away from this crappy, poorly made shoe that will weather in just a few short weeks."
"I return it, when loaded the folding flap made it to thick.  Otherwise it was not for me and felt like imitation material.  I was not going to write a review but the seller sent a letter requesting it."
"Not only are these briefs oddly oversized -- they are kind of like granny bloomers  --  but the elastic around the thighs is practically non-existent.
The reason for wearing tighty whities in the first place -- support -- is a complete after thought.  You get what you pay for.  Don't pay for this!"
"I did not like the fit of these.  They ran small but even when getting a size up, they simply weren't comfortable.  I had to return them.  They are extremely narrow, but also, just uncomfortable.  I like the Triumph ISO 2.0 much better."
"I loved them when they arrived and tried them on  .. WOW so sexy .... On my first wear of them the top layer of fabric started wearing off just from sitting in the car on leather seats!  SO embarrassing!  (I'm 5'6"" 118lbs) I don't recommend these due to fabric quality issues."
"This bra was not sized right.  I ordered a 32F because that's what I usually wear and the band wasn't right and the cup wasn't right.  Sending it back. Plus, the fabric was very flimsy and not good quality."
"Was not what i expected, shoe was too small."
These were way too big and bulky for my head. I don't have a lot of hair to begin with but I thought these would still look good and give a little pizzazz  to by boring work look. And it probably would have if these things would have stayed on and not been falling down so much that I constantly pushed them back up with them sitting too high on my head. It was a mess all around.
too small especially in the sleeves
"I wore Levis back when they were an American made quality product.  When they offshored, I jettisoned my biz and am currently buying Unionline.  Well, I was curious after these many years what had become of Levis - this once iconic American brand. I ordered a pair of 501s only to find what I had anticipated: build quality was crap (the stitching looks like third graders did it with a knitting needle (actually, that's probably not far from the truth)), material was thin and reminded me of the cheapos that typically end up on clearance racks), the fit after one wash was absurd. One leg tighter and shorter than the other? Seriously?

Levis - I left you years ago - and for good reason; your product is absolute, unmitigated crap."
Not as sparkle as I thought it would be the stones were dull
Fit on this shirt was not loose as I expected and the photo shows.  I will not wear it.
"Very uncomfortable.
By third wear, underwire was popping through."
"Poor quality and fit small. When the pants came out of the packing , you unfold the pants and hear the elastic crackling."
I orderd size 7 and it came 2 diffrent shoe  seize's on a Same pair.. : (
"These lasted about 3 days before they began to tear on the inside at the ball of the foot.
The inside fabric just came apart after about 3 times of wearing them around the house.
I would make a joke about toe nails, but it's under the toes that are the problem... so the joke doesn't check out.
You may think that this is an exaggeration, but surprisingly it's not."
They were quite larger than I expected...
"Unfortunately this shoe was not for me. I own several Dansko clogs & couldn't wait to have these for the summer. They are too wide for my narrow feet. I loved the color, the size fits perfect, just too wide. Had to send back."
It didn't do anything
"Not as pictured.  Gloves did not have individual fingers.  They do the job, though."
Waaayyyy smaller and shorter than expected
Was not  an exact size fit for what I wanted.  My size ran a little to small.
"Love the look, a little big but nice but it fell off my dresser and the screen cracked first week I got it!"
color is pretty but wig has no volume
"I should have heeded the reviewer who said that the ""fit of the shoe was off"" and to ""try before you buy.""  The shoe looks nice, but they do not have the ""cushiony"" feel like my other sneakers or the other pair that I bought (a different brand).  I tried these shoes on walking around the house, etc.  I walked up stairs and although it seemed that I could feel the stair under my soul, I decided to keep them.  That was a big mistake.  I went shopping in them.  The left shoe was a really big problem, and the right foot was a problem.  First my big toe seem to be hitting the top part of the shoe.  The more I walked, the more my foot seemed to be moving toward the front of the shoe.  I am not sure I am describing this correctly.  But after 2 hours of shopping, the front portion of my feet were hurting terribly.  I tried pushing my heel back in the shoe, but that did not work.  Eventually I tried balling my toes up.  Needless to say, I was glad when I got home and could take them off.  I would, if I could, send them back, but I had walked outside in them.  So I'll keep them, and try using them for very short periods of time.  This shoe is so bad, that it almost turned me against Easy Spirits, but then I looked at my shoes and a lot of them are Easy Spirits.."
Very bad sizing. Xl is more like small. Better get xxxl
"Fast shipping, soft sweater, nice print. Unfortunately my sweater came with a crease down the middle that after washing(twice) and drying never came out. also tried an iron. tried contacting about a replacement but was given give little to no help.  Good luck!"
"Towels came pretty fast, although the quality is not really good, the towels fade and the threads are coming off. You get what you pay for."
Isn't true sterling silver
"Looked great, but was way too small. I broke it while putting it on. It was a waste of $12.00, but I should have read more of the reviews from others. "
"The quality is not really good !
Is not worthy
Not satisfied."
Bottoms were too small the top too big.
"These fit PERFECTLY. Nothing like putting on a good bra!! Only thing that was a deal breaker is the cup inserts. Somewhere I read you could remove them, but this is not possible. If you want to look as though you've come out of the '50's, by all means, this is your bra. Otherwise, it's far too perky for me."
"Cool shoes, apparently comfy, but way too small!  My husband ordered a 12 - he can vary between a 12 and a 13 in shoe size.  The 12 didn't fit him at all.  It appears that if we order the 13 that it will snuggly fit.  Not ordering again.
We returned them.

Shame cuz the design was awesome :("
"No problem with calf fit, but I'm small. Ordered a 6 on a smokin' deal on Ebay. They just were not comfortable being too long for me. Wore them 2 or 3 times and just sold them on Ebay. I advertised them as being a 6, but fitting more like a 6.5 and provided measurements. Made me leery of the brand because of the size issue. Quality of leather is okay."
"Too Short, and too wide.  Not a true narrow."
"Was so excited to order matching PJs for the holidays. These arrived and we're slightly large and longer than anticipated, but not a big deal. Ordered a medium for a 170lbs, 5' 10' male with atheltic build. Decided to wash before wearing and they shrunk a lot - to the point of not comfortable to wear. Lost approximately 3 inches of length and are tighter everywhere. Washed in cold water and tumbled dried as per instructions. Same problem with women's. Incredibly disappointed."
The product was cute and fit perfectly but i only used it two times and zipper broke.  So im not very happy
These shirts are so thin you could fold one double and still read the Wall Street Journal thru it! I doubt they will last through a half dozen washings!
"I tried to like this bra, but the front zip design just isn't for me. It is hard for me to get it zipped up, so I end up reaching for one of my other sports bras instead of dealing with the hassle. I will say that once this bra is successfully zipped and on, I do like it and think it is comfortable to work out in. However, I would not buy it again or recommend it to anyone with a large bust because of how difficult it is to put on. I have other sports bras that I like just as much as this one that are much easier to put on."
"These shoes appear more like a man's shoe with a heel added to the back. I have a hard time wearing them because of the color inconsistency.  Not as comfortable as I would have like becaue they are a little stiff, however once they are on they do stay on. I would not rebuy them."
"You can't see the back in the photo so beware if you've got buns they aren't gonna make it in this suit. The slashes look like they're made with scissors, and there's no form keeping the girls up! Unflattering!"
Way
I returned it because it was way too small. They are going to refund me. I was hoping to get a size larger because I love the style. It too bad that I will not be able to have it.
"Total waste of time. My measurements are 32/22/35, and I'm five seven. It was too long on my body for starters. Couldn't close the bottom hooks and the top ones pushed my chest up awkwardly. The top I could do at about the first or second. The middle needed the tightest, maybe more. I couldn't select one clean row to hook. It looks strange, was too thick to wear under clothing, and was uncomfortable due to the fact that it isn't made for ANY curves at all... Returned it and got the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/YIANNA-Women-s-Latex-Sport-Girdle-Waist-Training-Corset-Waist-Shaper-Black-XS/dp/B00UG293KU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">YIANNA Women's Latex Sport Girdle Waist Training Corset Waist Shaper Black, XS</a>&nbsp;<-- item linked. That one actually works."
Way too small. This is NOT an accurate size for Plus sized women.
Yes they did away with some belt loopes awhile ago. Now they decided to make the crotch and buttocks area smaller in the 505 so the pants sit below the waistline. Bring back the old 505. Don't recomend.
Worst dress ever
"Admittedly, I'm accustomed to Fruit-O' fit but have a few Hanes ""most comfortable..."" around as well, they are all sized 'Large' and fit well but these, even after washing several times, were very baggy, not like-to-my-knees baggy but hanging well off-my-rear-bumper baggy, also I am disabled so my thighs are fairly small in girth but still the leg banding was very tight. I guess I thought that Hanes would have one standard 'Large' size but apparently not. I'll not purchase 'red label' again, sorry Hanes."
"I am a size 16 so I ordered a XXL.  The dress is a large at best!!  It looks cute but order at least 2 sizes up.  Definitely not meant for anyone over a size 12/14 and especially anyone with a large bust.  For $14 its not worth my effort to return it, where did they get that $45 retail price anyway?  What a joke."
"I should of sized down, these shoes run large. On top of that the button isn't sewed on. It's placed in a hole in a shoe with a fastener type of medal, like the old time paper metal clips you would open and close. Yea my button fell out after ONE day of wear and when I tried to put it back in all it did was stab my foot and cause my foot to bleed."
I wear a size small.  Knowing the material is tight fitting I ordered it in a size medium and it is still too small.
"Doesn't fit like a dress, more like a long shirt. The color is not as represented; it's a much brighter green, not to my liking. Pretty disappointing all around, there are better t-shirt dresses to be had."
"I bought these because they were recommended, on another website, for people with plantar fasciitis.  They do have decent (not great) arch support, but clogs are not good for this because you have to scrunch your toes to keep them on when you walk.  Also, the little flap that sticks up at the heel ends up under your heel, causing pain.  The flap should either go away or be made higher.  I always wear a size 38 (size 8 U.S.), but I heard they run small and got a 39.  They were tight.  On the positive side, the fabric is very nice and warm, and the sole is nice for hanging out in the house.  I am having a lot of trouble finding well designed house slippers."
"Firstly these boots are clearly the high quality you would expect from UGG. The leather and craftsmanship is sublime and they look very classy and stylish, timeless Chelsea boots here for sure. The bottom has a great grip tread but somehow manages to look steam line and not clunky in the slightest. For looks and craftsmanship these are five star all the way.
However.....a number of points cause me to sadly have to return these
1. Like a few other reviewers mention, they are strangely narrow in the heel which makes them quite a feat to just get on for that reason alone, yet for myself anyways this wasn't a painful issue, slipping them on will never be easy
2. I have regular width feet, bordering on narrow yet these are painfully narrow and scrunch your toe bones up so your feet click and crunch when you walk. One foot was worse than the other.
3. Sizing up is not a possibility realistically. Yes, Sizing up will give a little extra room at the length but they are not going to get wider and these are so narrow that wearing even the thinnest socks is impossible. I fear the extra length will just make them even more uncomfortable since now they are too tight width wise and they will slip and rub at the heel. Accounting for extra room by wearing thicker socks just can't happen with these

I would say if you have very narrow feet then these will work wonderfully for you.
I would say if your a sadist and are prepared to go through the torture of wearing them long enough to stretch the leather our enough to be comfortable then go for it.
Real shame, cause these are gorgeous on"
I didn't like the color of these shoes and I had to go up a 1/2 larger than what usually wear as these are cut very small.  I returned these shoes.
Cheaply made - the bottom crochet started unraveling the first day I wore it.  Very disappointed in the poor craftsmanship!!!
"I'm very disappointed and will be returning the shirt. The transfer is not whole it has skips and missing places. This happens when transfer is not hot enough so when transfer paper is removed some of the color remains on the paper. This is so clearly not done correctly I would have to call it a second. The shirt itself is heavy cotton and looks to be good quality. I also got a ""First Mate"" shirt by same company that has the exact same problem. I'm so glad I opened the bag as it was folded onto itself so you could not see the transfer and I purchased both as Christmas gifts."
"This was one of my daughters birthday presents and she was very happy. She wore it each day but always taking it off for showers, pool and at night to sleep. Within a week and a half the silver coating was wearing off and leaving black marks on everything. Very disappointed . I knew it wouldn't be an expensive piece of jewelry or last forever however I did think it would last at least a few months."
I can't testify as to the durability of these boots as I have to return them. I wear a size 10.5 in athletic shoes and most boots I wear are around 8.-9.5.  I ordered these in both a 10 and a 10.5 and it's as if the length of the boot didn't change at all.  The width of the heel changed which is bad for me because I have narrow heels.  But as of now my big toe touches the edge in BOTH sizes. No point in ordering a size 11 as my heel would flop around in the back. Otherwise they seemed like they would have been good boots.
"The fabric is nice, it didn't roll up on me - however I'm not the best judge of this considering I wore it only once.  The seam of the shirt of the neckline is finished with a thin layer of fabric - the piping? if you will, and it ripped right off and you could see it rising above the neckline of my shirt.  Also not happy because I went by the size guide and at the end of the night I had tender sore spots around the front of my armpits/upper boobie area from my skin rubbing along the material.  The arm holes go a little too far back so it became really irritating.

You might have better luck with this since it was relatively slimming on the stomach but if you're like me, 5'7 wearing a size Large, it might not work out.

Also disappointed that I e-mailed the company for an exchange and they never got back to me."
Very thin fabric. Order one size larger than you normally would!
"Never again. I've been a faithful buyer and supporter of Stacy Adams shoes and have purchased literally dozens of pairs over the past 15 years.  The last 2 pair I purchased, this pair at the end of March 2017, already has a hole in the bottom of the sole.  The previous pair I had (which I purchased these to replace), did the same thing but on the left foot.  Not sure what has changed in sole material but something is of lesser quality and I'm done with Stacy Adams.  Since Amazon won't allow me to return these, I'm left with posting this negative post."
These run about 2 sizes too large and they are very ugly.
"Nice feel, nice cut, nice color, the size is not accurate. I ordered Asia L/US M, but it's more like US S... other companies don't seem to have this issue..."
The temple is not right.
This is a waste of money
Fell apart in a matter of months.
"the buttons are to cheap, the pockets are to wide and big in the front and the bell is not as big as expected, is not as it looks, but since it was cheap the cost of production is fair to the cost of sale"
"Blue thread at two button holes on white shirt, sleeves at least one and half inches short!"
"I ordered size 7.5. I got right foot 7.5 but the left one is 8.5... I'm so unhappy, not satisfied at all!"
"I was excited in making this purchase being my friend has a similar one which I borrow from time to time. I decided to get my own. I was so excited to receive it I paid for one (1) day shipping.

My disservice began there. The order was made on the December 12, 2013 and it was delivered December 16, 2013, four (4) days later.
Secondly, on receipt of the product it did not work. I was most disappointed. So I returned it. On receipt of the returned item my account was credited within the time they said it would be done.
This has been my first disappoint and poorest service I ever gotten shopping here.

I do hope this is my first and last bad experience."
Champaign color is not too nice -and the shoe is somewhat large so if you are a 8.5 stick to that do not go to a size 9.  Shoe is comfortable. Price is good.  Shipping was excellent but it was unfortunately not my style
But it doesn't last long at all it easily stretches out of proportion. And the hooks easily pulls out mine did didn't even get to wear it for a good 2 weeks and 2 of the hooks came out of its place.
"I'm 5'7"", weigh 186 and am a pear shape meaning all hips no chest. The armholes were too large and the bottom portion fit good but a little too big. If only it had a sewn in slip that would really help too, very see through."
Blisters. 'nuf said.
"I really liked the style of the shoe but it just ran very narrow. I ordered the wide size, but they were still too tight. Had to return them."
"Received on 1/22. On 3/6 the Nike logo started peeling off, JUST outside the return window. Don't buy these. I suspect they may be counterfeit."
The wallet was of the highest quiality but the product was to big to fit into any of my pants or suit pocket. It needs to be smaller in size and keep the function.
This bra has removable pads. Maybe some people want that but they really didn't work for me. All you could see was the huge shape of the pad over my boob. I took them out and then you could see the imprints of the straps that connect the bra to the shoulder straps. It just was not flattering and I cant see being able to wear this under shirts without it being lumpy and noticeable. Spring for the medela one which is just a couple bucks more and looks way better on.
Honesty is the best policy and this bra was nothing like what the model is sporting on the picture. I received the package and once I tried it on it was so small and it is not black. It should say black and brown! Also I had to pay for returning it which was annoying being that the package the send it is a plastic bag that will rip once you open it. I am a 38DDD this is not fitting for big breasts AT ALL!
Badly made. Does not fit like picture projects.
Received wrong size but I believe its manufacturer's error
strange underwire in that you can see the midpart through your shirt its like your wearing a CORSET otherwise xomfortablw but strangelooking
"I thought these would be four good, basic shirts for fall to layer under sweaters and buttoned shirts and a good bargain at that price.  Well, as the saying goes, ""If it looks too good to be true, it probably is.""  These shirts run well below size - I purchased medium and what I received would barely fit over my head, and I am not a large person.  The material is thin and very cheap feeling.  I didn't even try the shirt all the way on because of the fit and the feel of the cloth.  I returned it right away."
I ordered a large to get sleeve length and should have ordered a XXL. I am 5'10 and 135 pounds and thus sweater was so small it would be embarrassing to wear in public unless under something.
"It was broken when arrived I had to supper glue it, it should be sent by FedEx do they could've be deliverd to my door instead been Put mailbox."
I bought a white pro xp and also the regular white dansko. Both have such small toe box. I have shoe bite if I wear for more than 5 hours. Also I wore it so can't return them. I did remove the cushion on the arch so as to make it roomy. Pro xp is slightly roomier although not much of a difference. I am 36. I bought 36. Runs too small. My feet not so wide. I never had trouble with other brands.
This dress is horrible. It is way to tight. The thread is also loose. The white is not really white. It looks nothing like the photo. A major let down I wasted $6. I am so sorry I bought this. :( I threw the dress away.
No fly on these! Back to the store
"Haaaaate this bra. It is not comfortable, feels rough, and makes my breasts look like funnels. It is too small, and seems a little smaller around than my other bras - sports, leisure and balconette - and the cups are smaller. Hence the coning of my breasts. Those bras mentioned above are the same size as this bra I ordered and it is slightly smaller around and the cups are about half a size smaller. I was hoping to find a good G cup sports bra - it looked so good on here. I would send it back if I wouldn't have moved to a new city and would have to take a bus all the way to the post office just to send it back."
my ten and a half year old is slim and this is too big
"Too tight in the legs.  Was looking for something cooler for summer, but the fit just wasn't there and I am in great shape.  Body type I guess."
see-through.
"Original review :  I'm giving these leggings four stars because according to the size chart, I was supposed to purchase a large which I did. However, the large did not fit as snug as leggings are supposed to fit. The waist and leg area both were loose. I took the tag off and washed and dried them so I cannot return but I do feel as though I lost 36 dollars because I don't feel comfortable wearing loose fitting leggings with the outfits I had planned to wear these HUE leggings with. I have purchased HUE curvy denim leggings in large and they should be arriving today... I'm hoping the elasticity in those are a little less stretchy so maybe the large will fit and I won't have to go through the hassle of returning the ""jeggings"". I believe that if there leggings were a little tighter I would really love them.

After wearing leggings for a few weeks (not consistently) : okay this review started with four stars because the item was not exactly true to size and pretty expensive to me. Also the leggings are see through. Now I have to rate them 1 star because the stitching on the leggings are all starting to come apart and I can't even wear them anymore. I am truly disappointed because I have purchased multiple pairs =("
"This was so paper thin and flimsy I couldn't get it to stay straight underneath the sweater I wanted to wear over it.  It reminded me of a thin hankerchief with a collar; there was no body to the fabric.  I threw it in the trash, what a waste!"
"No way the jeans are 33/32, no way. They have  larger legs than a 32 size (by a lot), and are like two big sizes more.
Otherwise, these jeans would be perfect because they are curvy and nice."
"Wish I can give this dress 0 stars
It's horrible!
Sizing it's so off. I made sure to measure myself but I still was so off"
"Tarnished within less then a week, a lifetime guarantee is useless when they tarnish in less then a week."
Not very good quality ; after wearing them for a month ; the size got bigger and wore out really fast; I will go back to buying wolverine shoes wearing  it for a year and still going strong.
"I'm 34 waist size but this one is really small, is like a 32 waist size"
Looks nothing like the picture and is super cheesy and the tip of the cover will not bend like a witch shoe
"A size 10W might have fit better. However, I haven't worn them as yet"
I have another exact pair of these shoes and absolutely love them.  So disappointed in my new pair.  Something is different.  The seam on the toe created blisters and I was unable to wear.  Like I said I love my first pair but had to send back my second pair.  I'm not sur what happened in the transition.
"IT'S LONG,  HARD TO UNBUTTON,"
I am 5`0 and 113 lbs. It's a little bit tight. But that's ok to me. The thing I don't like is the stitches and it's quite funny how they made it. Don't get me wrong I like the cut of this dress.
"Tried this as an alternative to the Cushion Solution product that I've purchased in the past, but my most recent buy did not adhere at all to my rings.

So, tried this as a hail mary as I have a number of rings which I use this type of product for.  ZERO effectiveness, comes off the first wearing.

Tried multiple rings after letting set a full 48 hours to cure (longer than needed) & it slides right off with ZERO adhesive quality.

I'm searching for some alternative, I this time I don't know of any - but this neither of these products work with their current formulation."
"way too tight around the strap area, had to return them"
"These actually fit, and they're not thin crappy see through tee shirts.  However, a couple months later splitting apart at the seams around the arms."
Stone fell out after wearing it for an hour.
"Fine for a cheap pair, comes with a wax mold that forms to your teeth. Didn't corm comfortably to my teeth and they silver drove into my gums. Used these for joker cosplay, look like cheap knock-offs for the Leto Joker."
This it was obviously worn prior to it being sold as a new costume to me. Disgusting and disappointing.
These shoes are a bit over my price range so I thought I would see if I could buy 1 for half the price. I thought if I bought one for my husband (they are just his size) then he would be at least halfway cool. Unfortunately buying just one wasn't an option. It's really not fair to people on a budget that these shoes must come in a pair.
"It fits ok but the material its not comfortable,  is stiff and itchy around the middle."
Picture is much different than what I received. Quality and sizing seems to be off as well. Still nice looking boots but why can't the seller just post an accurate photo?? It's not rocket science.
The bag was a nice soft leather and beautiful color but way to small for my needs.  I returned it.
"These are nice, but waaaay too small. I'm normally a comfortable size 8. I would need a size 12 in these as they are made. Returned."
"I returned these shoes, the back of the shoe had too much room, my toes slid to the front, thus the room at the back, and they felt very unstable and uncomfortable."
"Really nice hat but way too small. Must be nice for women or children, not big men,"
"Very cheap product. Way overpriced. The sides are metal however overall they are plastic - and mine came bent and not straight, which can't be tweaked. Nice case and accessories-  I will buy some other pair and use those but these glasses are almost useless. They're more of a men's size, although the bridge of the nose is far too small and slips down your nose."
"No give at all.  Made from denim like material with absolutely no stretch.  If you are looking for typical Dockers big and tall fit, look somewhere else."
"Sending back.  I really like the color of this sweater, but it had no shape and just hung on me."
"Lots of compression and no separation. Fit is definitely on the small side. After wearing it and washing it a couple of times, one of the velcro straps has become very itchy and bothersome."
The ring does not look like this when you receive it.  The heart stones are not as defined as in the picture.  It actually looks like it came from a 50 cent bubble gum type machine.
"should be listed as KIDS hat, not for adults.  or adults with xs/s heads"
Runs much smaller than shoe size.
"The material feels really cheap.  Reminds me of a cheap plastic table cloth.  Although my daughter hasn't worn it, I fear that itll be torn in no time.  The design is pretty, just wish the material was more durable."
Size is a lot off
"Tried one in the store and bought it online but it was a different  kind of shoe . Too big , different fit !"
Had to return them because they were too small.
Obnoxiously huge. We returned it.
poor quality... don't buy
These are HUGE I wasn't pleased at all.
"Bought for a ""Where's Wenda"" costume.  Decided against wearing it.  Cheap, and cheaply made.  Not flattering on my body.  I don't see wearing this at all."
"These sandals felt good for the first month, with plenty of cushion and comfort while walking. Three months later, the heel is so thin that I may as well be wearing no shoes at all. I am thoroughly disappointed. Not only did the heel compress to the point of discomfort, the toe straps stretched out and made the sandals feel really loose. These sandals are better suited for someone who would wear them once or twice a month, not someone living in a sunny beach city.

I purchased this pair of sandals to replace a pair of 1+ year old Reef Smoothies. Today, I found my old Reef sandals in the closet, put them on, and was surprised to find how much more comfortable they are than this pair of 3 month old Teva's. Great initial quality and comfort, inadequate durability and useful life. In my opinion, the Reef Smoothies are a far superior option if you're looking for this type of style in a pair of sandals."
"After wearing this a few times with the included straps and washing it...the straps have shred/fallen apart!
A waste of money!"
"My 16 year old son did not like these.  He said they did not look like real gauges in any sense.  He tried a pair on, but never wore them."
"The color's okay, but the shirt isn't nearly as long as pictured. It portrays going past your natural waist AND hips, but mine barely skimmed the waist of my mid-rise jeans."
"These earrings do not look like real silver. They are comfortable but look more like cheap, cosmetic jewelry you can buy at Kmart.  I haven't worn them much for that reason."
"Perfect fit.....  If I was still in the fifth grade.  I stand 5'10"" tall and weigh around 200 lbs.  Too small,  too tight."
I like them. They are comfortable but the pattern is different from each leg. The pattern doesn't line up like shown on the picture.
"Awesome looking shoe,great comfort but didn't even last 30 days of just general use. Sole started peeling away from the shoe!"
"I have an extremely high arch, a wide foot and large calves. So, It may fit someone with the average wide foot. However, the zipper would not zip up, and I tried to zip it without my foot in the boot. The zipper was damaged and seemed cheap. It was not a high-quality zipper."
"After wearing once, it stretched out so wide that it won't stay up anymore. The colors are cute but only get it if you want it bunched up at the bottom of your leg."
Too light of A jacket
The green flecks in the stone aren't really green.  The photograph is misleading. I wanted a green ring.  What I received was a black stone with indistinct tan colored flecks in the stone.
The  outside zippered pockets were too small for my phone.  I have another Baggallini purse that looks like this one but in another color and it is perfect for my needs.  However I needed a black one.
I was so looking forward to comfortable scuba with lots of pockets. But the tops were large on top but tight at the waist I wear everything else in the size I sordered. So this was really disappointing.now I have to send them all back
"The material is itchy under the arm, this may go away with several washings, but my skin is sensitive. Plus the fabric comes up to high under the arm when I adjust the straps to provide better cleavage cover. I'm a nurse and hoped to find an under shirt that will hide my high cleavage from patients, but this isn't it."
If you have full breasts small or large be happy don't bother with paddings. These were not designed for us I ordered my correct size and It didn't even cover my nipples
"They don't stay up without the garterbelt
THAT DOESN'T COME WITH THEM!!!"
"Ended up returning this. The gun isn't the right gun for Indiana Jones, and it was orange and blue (I know, they have to make toys colorful so they are not thought to be real). The material this is made of is incredibly flimsy, and the belt is for someone with twice my girth. Maybe three times."
"What can I say, just didn't like it"
painful
Not comfortable at all to me. Feel like cheaply made socks. They are the right size but I want something more. I do not recommend and I hope this helps.
"Not what I expected; very thin ( I need to pay more attention to details), the straps are especially thin/long with no real structure."
"The shoes are fine as long as you don't expect them to be waterproof.  I bought them to wear to the park to play with my dog. As far as staying dry during the rain, don't count on it.  Unfortunately, these shoes do not stay dry even in a lawn that is simply wet with the morning dew.  After only a few minutes running around in the yard in the morning renders my socks all wet.  It's a great disappointment because the advertising clearly states that these shoes are waterproof.  I can't imagine that they would hold up dry in a wet trail and definitely not under rainy conditions."
I bought these to wear to the office every day in a business-casual environment. I found they look looked very stylish and felt comfortable. The reason I do not like these shoes is that they creak and groan. I wore them only around the house for about 1 hour on the carpet. After just that time they started to creak with every shift of my weight or step. It was so bad that my wife thought that I was making the shoes creak intentionally. I purchased a 12M and they fit as expected.
LOVED everything about these shoes Except that they had no arch support which made it impossible for me to stand in them for more than a minue and walking was nearly impossible.
Watch was a lot bigger than I expected and I didn't like the band.
"Updated review, 11/23/14:
------------
after having these shoes for less than a year, and wearing them casually and lightly for parts of winter, spring and now the fall of 2014, I'm sorely disappointed in their quality.  The shoes are already showing grossly excessive deterioration of the tread on both shoes, having lost numerous lugs on the rear third of both shoes.

Subsequent to purchasing, I found out that these shoes are made by Wolverine, the very same company that bought what was once a great brand of shoes in Merrell, and ruined them.  I've had three pairs of Merrell Chameleon Prime Stretch shoes in the last two months that have had such poor quality soles/treads that have become unglued and/or lost lugs in less than three weeks wearing, that I will never buy another Wolverine family product again.

I think the US Federal Government needs to prosecute this company for putting out shoddy products and charging top dollar for products that fail.  With the technology that exists today, there's not excuse for shoes that are worn lightly, in less than one year's time, losing chunks of the tread.  I've had shoes that have lasted me 5+ years that have never lost tread like Wolverine products do.

---------------------------------------------------------------
I find the Shelk to be a great all-around comfortable shoe that while running a half to full-size larger than other shoes, is excellent for the money and a far better value than its cousins in the Merrell line.  So far the shoe is proving durable in the two months I have owned it and hope it stays that way.  I might well buy 2-3 pairs for saving, in case they stop making it."
"Material hard and stiff
Not what I expected.  The material is hard and stiff and the adjusting guide scratches the back."
Boots run a little big. Only problem is I ordered black boots and received brown boots. Needed them for a ski weekend so had to make do with brown.
Unwearable.  Returned.
"I don't agree that it works. It doesn't stay in place,
It just dangles loosely even after adjusting. Overpriced in my view. Just a cloth strap & metal clips for usd 9.99.
I recommend Simple Wishes Hands Free Breastpump Bra, not this."
Beautiful design and color. But I never wore it because the material and construction were so cheap.
"Sorry. I had to return these.  They were too pale as far as color goes.  I wanted them for the 2nd ear piercing, and they hardly showed color at all. They were cheap, but that's what I got...not even close to what I wanted."
I had such high hopes. I put like every color in my cart to save for later. But ordered 1 to start. It's a tank. Nothing special. Not long. I ordered a 3x. And it just was not long at all. Very bummed.
"these overboots seem like they are well made but lightweight. they are a little pricey. they're just the thing for a wet day at work.

UPDATE!!! i bought these boots in late spring and haven't used them due to a dry summer. they have sit on my covered front porch for six months. i got them out this morning after a rainy night and put them on over my shoes. they have dry rotted and had holes and cracks in them. turns out that they are JUNK."
Com on son. i cant even fit my booty cheeks in here. it doesnt even lift. it just looks like you got a sideways baby on you butt.
"A lot of fraying, treads needed to be trimmed and the top portion sits too low cut for work"
"made the mistake of getting a brown pair of these a year ago, and found an acceptably inexpensive boot with however rotten quality control...the stitched design on the front of the boot was facing off in a 55 degree direction instead of 90 degrees perpindicular, and was additionally off to one side. remarkable.

i decided this week to try the black leather version hoping this would turn out different but instead it was worse. this time one boot was smooth leather, the other boot had the pattern you see in the photo. PLUS the smooth boot had a pointed round toe, while the other boot had a big huge full round toe on it, like twice as big.

back for refund, but what a hassle. i'd stay away from justin boots that are made in china, which means most if not all under $175 or so. if made to design, these would be wonderful boots, but because of rotten/NO quality control you get things like 2 different style boots when you order these (both idiotically marked with the same style number) or other weird things like toe stitched insignia looking like a postage stamp put on the wrong way."
"I don't know if I didn't read the description thoroughly enough but I was expecting a more modest lift. I'm a B cup and like a gentle ""push"" but this bra is heavily padded and makes my boobs look obviously fake. I will not wear it."
"Very short, pants required"
I usually wear a small bottom and a medium top. I ordered this in a large after reading that it runs small. The bikini I received would not fit an adult over 90 lbs. looks like it is for a small child. Waste of money! At least it was only $12. Barely worth paying to ship it back...
Scratchy stiff material around the neck and the sleeves.  No child would be comfortable wearing this!  I returned it.
2nd time I have tried buying this shirt and its just too big no matter what size I order. Its like the shirts were cut the same but they put different labels on it. Also has a very bad smell to it. returning again.
Turned finger green.
"Poor quality to be honest.... The spanner is absolute trash, the screw drivers fell apart after 1use. I cannot recommend this kit."
It's looks very cheap unisex watch . I'm not going to wear air and as a gift l don't know what to say ....
"Looks nice, but can't fit a lot in it. Smaller than a traditional backpack. Very narrow inside. Tight fit for a school binder."
"The package was labeled wrong. On the outside of the package it said XL, but the capris were actually 2XL. Way too big. I am returning them."
"The edge of the right cup was already stuck out, so that it is visible even through the thick sweater. So it was nothing more than waste of money."
I have trouble finding work shoes.  I have wide feet and these stretch a lot if I wear then to much.  Like squeak with every step.
"Aside from being too tight in the vamp, the Amazon photo shows a nice turquoise/teal...the shoe came to me in NAVY blue. I never wear navy blue. These are going back."
"These are really cute, but they are definitely not leather. There is no leather present on these moccs, even though the ad says they are 100% leather. I'm sending them back."
"Ring was much larger than i expected making it appear  ""unreal"", and the stones fell out almost instantly, very poorly made."
Returned this...it's more of a sweatshirt than a jacket. The fabric is not very heavy.
Its a different fabric than other shirts that i bought.
Cheap and sewed wrong! Don't waste your money!!!!
Case is thin and quality looks poor for the amount of money it cost
Nice look but very cheap material. Only got a couple of wears out of them before they started peeling. Save your money
"Doesn't fit anywhere.  Good fabric, cute coat would love it if it was only in my size and I am a XL - XXL and this was a medium (made in China)"
Comfy but be prepared to have your home invaded by little fuzz balls that will go everywhere. These little fuzz balls will end up in places that you will be embarrassed to admit on any online review post.
"These shoes are adorable!  They would be comfortable too if they were actually wide.  I wear a wide, ordered a wide, and these shoes HURT!  I passed them to a friend who actually orders a narrow and she LOVES them.  She says they might be the most comfortable flats that she has ever worn.  I wish the wide width was wide enough for my foot.  Don't bother ordering if you have a wide foot."
"not worth what I paid for it, looks and feels cheap."
Uncomfortable and thinner than expected. Feels very cheap. Disappointed
I wear 34X34 so I purchased a size larger based on reviews and they were way too large/long. Sent back for 34X32.
"I ordered this to be able to wear with my wedding ring but it looks too fake, it looks like the play jewelry you get from the 25 cent machines."
"It's a monster size watch and very heavy again the due to amazon's poor description online I didn't get that I had expected. I got a big ,thick, heavy ghetto looking watch that can be used as a roman shield, sap ,  get two and you got some blingy heavy hands for you daily run. I am a big guy so I could work around the size but it was too bloody heavy. It work ok but be aware this is a huge heavy watch. I returned it do poor description it's big very thick and heavy. Amazon needs to add the actual weight of the watch in their descriptions I do not like any watch weighting more than one pound rarely is the watches weight is listed it would have saved me two returns if the real weight was posted."
The one I received didn't look like the picture! I returned it!
"I LOVE the Viv leggings I have recently been purchasing! I decided I also needed some solid colors since I had purchased all the patterns I liked. These do fit but they are not Viv. I got a brand called Itzon. They are horrible! See through,shiny not seemless! I have more solid colors on the way and will send them ALL back!"
They didn't look like the described picture and they irritate my nieces ears. I was not impressed. Made in China junk!
these run entirely too small
"*****Update 9/30/16 [7-8 months later]*****

As you can see from the pictures, these have holes within the first year.  I live in Philadelphia and we've had a relatively dry year until this week, so I've only worn these 20ish times.  Almost immediately after stepping outside this morning, I noticed my foot getting wet and the obvious hole in the side of my boot.  My fuzzy sock and tights were soaked by the time I got to work.

Very unhappy as I have a very difficult time finding rainboots that fit my calf and wide foot and from a comfort standpoint these weren't bad, but they are obviously lacking in quality.

****Original Review****

I measured my foot and calf prior to ordering, as I have wide feet and large calves.
My foot is 9"" long and wide, and my calves are 16.2"".
I ordered an 8 in the black without a buckle (Idk if that makes a difference), which is actually 9.6"".  They fit, lengthwise I have a thumb which is about 0.5"".  I could have comfortably gone with a 7.5, however, I am now reluctant to return, as width wise, they seem to just fit and the size chart does not provide width.  I actually would probably prefer a size down, as they are kind of heavy, but I don't want to risk it.  They fit my calf well, I can stick my hand down the side while I'm in."
Inaccurate sizing.  XXL would fit US size M
It was broken when we took it out of the package.
"Not what I expected.  I have one from several years ago, the same size.  Didn't try it on."
I ordered this and received it today.  The first zipper I tried to zip fell right off the end.  It was not stitched closed.  This is really inexcusable poor quality.  I will return it immediately.
"Good item , good size but I believe the interior rubs off on the shoes inside as i have found black marks on my brand new nike's which are white. I recommend this item only for black shoes."
Even with adjusted straps all the way tight it is way to big!
Wrong watch.. I ask this watch and you send me another...
Wore it twice during some all-day conferences and the fabric was misshapen at the end of the day to the point where the creases would not line up correctly enough to run an iron from the waistline to the hem. Can not recommend these.
"very high, very uncomfortable platforms, I have not yet released"
"Uncomfortable frames and the lenses are awfulmagnification isn't consistent across the lenses and the coating smudges extremely easily and don't clean well with enclosed cloth. Craftsmanship is adequate, but these have a cheap feeling overall. They don't stay on top of my head well, hug the face too tight, and I had to clean them with annoying frequency. Returned."
Not staying up for me.  I found that if I cut my black nylon knee highs to ankle-height stays in place better than these socks.
"The opening is so narrow! I know my son is a big fella, but boots should be loose anyway in order to tuck pants in. I seriously don't understand it, just looking down the boot, it's so small. If your child is chubby in any way (mine is only a year old and still chubby!) then heed my warning. I couldn't get my son's leg in. They are so cute though... Perhaps ordering a larger size would result in a larger calf but I doubt it and then he would trip over the too-long foot. So bummed :("
"Cute bag, and the leather bottom makes it nice and sturdy. Hopefully it'll stand up to whatever middle school can throw it's way!

It's not ONE MONTH into school and I've had to re-sew both straps on both ends!  The sides are wearing thin already.  My daughter doesn't overload her bag, but it's not holding up to middle school needs.  It's a cute bag for sleep overs or light use, but not daily school use."
"This is my second watch in the past five months. The pins pulled out of both of them. Also, the date stopped working. Great style, but the quality is surely lacking."
Ordered a XL and received leggings that are very small. Almost child size. My 10 yr old daughter might be able to fit them but that's still a gamble.
"I followed the suggestions from all the other reviews and ordered 7.5 originally (I usually wear 6.5 for street shoes). Unfortunately, that was a little short. So I returned that pair by paying the returning fee, and ordered a 8.0 right away.
I was hoping to get a great pair and use that immediately in my Zumba class! How wrong I was!!
They sent me a 8.0, an used one!
I can surely tell it has been used, because the lace was not in its original shape, and they forgot about the spare lace that the 7.5 pair came with!
Well, I have to return it again, and I'm not sure if I should give it another chance.
Very unhappy experience.
But, the size 8 was fitting me ok."
"This is a bad imitation of the item shown in the picture, made of the poorest quality and worst fabric I have ever seen. Just trying it on it falls apart. It is almost impossible that it fits as per Western standards because it makes breasts look completely flat even if ordering 2 or 3 sizes up your current US size. Customer service zero. Contacted them, they offered replacement or refund but nothing happened. Don't waste your money."
"The length on these slippers is as the size indicates, but they are way too wide for me.  I did not read that in the description prior to ordering them.  I have the scuffs and love them, so thought I would also order these since the scuffs are pretty warm for the summer.  A mistake...I don't think I will be wearing them & may even send them back if I am still within the 30 day window for returns.  My foot slides all the way through them."
"The hat is cute, but way to big for my 3 year old.  Even with it being adjustable, it doesn't fit right, so he doesn't wear it.  This is clearly an adult hat."
Feels like half size too small and can't use them because the opening at the toe cuts into my skin.
These were not the bows I was looking for to small
these are so small I don't even know how you could use them for anything
"Super cheap looking (I know, the price is cheap, so what did I expect) and runs small.  Had to return asap!"
"I hate this bra with everything in me. It looks like I have comes strapped to my chest. There is no support and even with size Ds, I have absolutely no cleavage. I do. Or suggest this at all!"
"Too tight, horrible to walk in.  Gave them to a friend with smaller feet, he likes them."
"The foot section was way to long.  However, the riser went up the leg nicely and held postion."
It looked prettier in the picture. Very bulky.
Just not my fashion.  The only real bad thing was they were so straight that Sun was coming in the side way too much.
"I have no idea why I made the mistake of purchasing these ""organizer bags."" They were supposed to help make traveling more efficient, but they did the opposite. I could have used the plastic bags I get from my local grocery and they would have done a better job. Poor quality, defective and a waste of money."
"The rhinestones fell off, even some in shipping envelope. Poor quality."
This brand of shoe does not run consistent . The 37 was too small and the 38 much too large. They were returned . My recommendation is try them on in a store and if they fit buy them. If you order them online the fit is not going to be the same in the same shoe as they are definitely aren't consistent !
"Unfortunately I would not buy this again.  It's not 100% cotton (my fault for not reading the description) but the worst part is that it's too tight in the shoulder area to be comfy while you're lounging at home.  Placket area can be unbuttoned pretty far down which is nice if you want to show some cleave.  But due to the fit, I fear it's just going to sit in the closet now."
"I have wide feet and even tried going a size down, but the shoe is excessively wide. I had to return it."
"Very small, pay attention to oriental sizes"
Thought it was so cute and the price was right... But the bottoms were WAY too small. They fit like a regular two piece bottom almost. Definitely not like the picture! Super disappointed. :(
The strap broke after 10 months of owning and the shoes were not worn often. The strap pulled away from the bottom while wearing. Poor quality.
"This rating does not haveanything to do with Amazon.

This is the 2nd pair of NB that I've purchased online and I'm not satisfied with the product.  This pair of NB soles are separating from the shoe.  Be warned, some of the shoes online aren't the real deal - these happen to show made in China on the label and I believe that NB are made in the USA.  I'll be more careful who I buy from next time."
"Ill sum this up for you guys in one following sentence.

Wear socks with it or your feet will have a bad day!"
"Cheap, fake cr@p. Not even a good knock-off. Go to Walmart and buy a cheap t-shirt and a sharpie to write Under Armour on it and you have a better shirt"
"I don't know who this listed vendor is supposed to be but these are an Oriental Trading Company branded product.  Had I known, I wouldn't have ordered them. They are the standard, cheap OTC product.  I had to re-knot several of the closure strings, sew corners together, and cut off all the sloppy loose threads.  I guess a good point would be that the fabric is cute and bright but they were too high-maintenance just to make them useable as party treat bags."
The material is very light but you can see glue in the gaps like it was made in a rush.
"The boot, around the bottom of my ankle, is caved in and not easily straightened out... these are shorter boots.. only go up to about half of your calf..."
"So disappointed with asics.  Second pair, differences styles, that I ordered...I wth both being too smalll.  These especially were too short and have no give in the toe as there is a hard plastic piece to protect front of toe box.  They are going back."
Its cropped. Its not supposed to be cropped. Nope. No thank you.
"If you buy this, consider it a rental because it's very cheaply made. Mine worked fine for ten months and then stopped working. Even though it is still under warranty, the company has ignored my requests for warranty service. The only way to contact them is through a gmail address, and they are just ignoring my emails. I wouldn't buy anything from Diplomat again.

*Well, almost immediately after posting this (and letting Amazon know how unhappy I was with Diplomat), Amazon notified me that they are sending me a replacement on their own. This is the type of customer service that makes Amazon my favorite place to buy things."
"The shoe would be very comfortable if the sizing was correct.  I ordered my regular shoe size 6.  I have small feet and these shoes were very narrow.  In order for me to wear these, I will have to order a whole size up and even then, I am not sure the width will be good."
It was very short and poorly made but that's not the worst part! When I opened it it had the worst formaldehyde smell I have ever experienced from clothing. I felt like I was bout to dissect a cat in anatomy class. Absolutely awful.
-_-
I had to send them back as one shoe was larger than the other.  I would like to reorder as I hope it was just that one pair.  Very nice shoe.
"Too big, though tight in the toe area. Flopped around on the back of my feet.
I returned them"
These socks began to fall apart after the first use. The stitching literally began to come undone and strands were sticking out.  They are also fairly small feeling.  I can't act surprised though given how cheap they were.  I tried to save a few bucks by buying these over the more expensive ones.  I would not do that again.  I would not recommend these socks.
"If you have narrow feet, these are the slides for you! I love the color, but these are not made for people who have shape or width in their feet. I am not one of those people, so they went back."
Very disappointed in this purchase.  Material was on the thin side and was very clingy.  I even went up 2 sizes because I like my sleepwear loose and comfortable.  It was still tight fitting and clingy.  Sending it back.
These are very cute. My son wanted  some toast socks and I couldn't find any for boys. This pack had one he could wear! The others I would give to my daughter. They fit him really tight and he said they were uncomfortable he is nine years old and wears a size 2.  The quality is very poor as well not soft or inviting.
Nice heavy material but fit was not flattering at all. Returned it.
Nice shirt but runs extremely small.
These were too narrow and I had to return them.
These fit poorly. I've bought them in the store and they are perfect. I bought these because it was a five pack but they are different. I'm sending them back.
got this to help make a ball gown puffy and it really just smooshed under the dress so it looked the same.
This watch was either scratched or had been worn by another person.  One side of the band was showing black thru the rose gold.  I have returned it for a refund.  I ordered another Citizen watch & the band had a protective covering on it so it couldn't be scratched.
Not well made. Had a cheap feel to it and was badly fitted. I returned it.
"Positives first: It is very unique and my daughter likes it because no one else has one.

Negative: It took six weeks to get here but we knew that it was going to be slow when we ordered it so that didn't really play into the review.
The owl is printed on rubber and it smells of rubber as well. This is not leather.
The back panel is cheap leather but I feel it was misrepresented and too expensive .
It is small and even if her lunchbox would fit inside, the small zipper (between the horns) won't allow a standard size lunchbox.
It is large enough for one folder and some papers and that's it.

That being said, my middle schooler loves owls so much that she is willing to carry this pack, her lunchbox and her flute separately. She still uses it but I feel a bit conned."
"first time i ordered Xl because my size is Xl
but was very very smal for me.i gave to my sister ( my sister's size is Small)
next time i ordered XXXL .
so if you are xl you should order3XL"
"The Shoes are Not as well made as( the Other ones i bought sanuk) I get what i pay for.. The bottoms of these are porous and the portion that is made of the actual yoga mat is Much thinner than that the other brand. and then there is a piece of Hard cloth wrapped around each side and around the Toe ! where us Ladies put our delicate Toes.. not fun to get Blisters..ouch !Rather than sending back, I chose to remove the cloth and replace with cloth of my own. a Silk material. and will wear..for however long they last. from now on. i will stick with buying the other brand. Sanuk."
These are not identical to the FOL Breathable in the store. Not the same fabric.
"poor quality , poor fabric"
"Loved the idea of these and the color of the lenses... I had read some reviews about them breaking easily but decided to try them anyway due to low cost, knowing Id be ultra gentle with them. They looked great for a week and then bam... they broke in the middle. Dang."
fit funny...had to return
"Disappointed - I have owned Dunham 4E's before and loved them.  This one is too tight in front, and it causes a significant amount of pain.  Unfortunately I was traveling when I first wore them, and didn't have a choice but to suffer through, so I'm stuck with them now.

They look great - but the pain isn't something that works for me."
"Painted on the metal. I never wear it. It's very heavy too. I probably wouldn't recommend it if you get migraines in the back of your neck because it's a little heavy. To me, since it's painted, it looks inexpensive."
"Would have had a five star review except for the terrible packaging.
Opened the envelope package and found out the hard way that it was leaking--got it all over my clothes and hands... There was still enough solution in the container to polish my rings, but overall not too happy with my experience."
"This dress is VERY short. I'm only 5' 5"" and there's no way I could even walk in this, let alone sit down. It also fits nothing like a 1920's dress; it's much too fitted."
run very small PLUS sent them in off white so I sent back to AMAZON
"Planning to return.  I ordered my normal size,but  the fit was awful."
"I bought these since they looked cute, but this photo is quite deceptive.  There is only that ""leather"" paneling on one side of each leg, and it doesn't go up in such a steep diagonal...not nearly as flattering.  I'm usually a small, so ordered a medium just in case, but they won't even go over my butt!  But the legs are baggy...so I assume these are for women with absolutely no butt whatsoever.  Immediate return."
They are too small and fall off easier than other socks.
THE APPLIQUES WERE NOT AS NICE AS SHOWN ONLINE
Too large by at least a full size and no padding whatsoever.  Sent back.
"I purchased this shirt for my four-year-old who adores Curious George. I ordered the size five to be on the safe side, but was upset when I received this shirt. The shirt is surely wide enough for a size five, but the length of it was correct length for my 20 month old. It's completely unusable and I have a very disappointed little boy."
"Ended up keeping these though I should have sent them back. The more I wear them the larger they get. The inseam was NOT what was listed, they were at least an inch longer."
new blank cuff beanie visor is okay but I didn't like the way it fit on the top of my head
Cheap. Sean ripped upon first wear.
The fabric is odd - like a gauzy blouse. Runs very small.
"did not have a front of back labeled, and didn't lay right no matter how I put it on.  It always looked backwards based on the bunching at the neck"
The look of the shoe was fine and just as pictured but the sizing is way off. I normally wear a women's size 10 and ordered the size 11. They were rediculously small. They fit like a size 9.
"Sent the wrong size and there's an awful fish smell, I can't get rid of."
Looks good enough but you'll need to pad these to be bearable.
"The fit is really bad - folds at the crouch and looks funny. It is a relaxed fit, of course, but the way it looks around that area is strange. Moreover I did not quite like the material. Just stiff and thin."
"For one thing the size chart is completely and utterly off. I actually had a good 1 1/2 inches or space in the toe compartment. Secondly, these shoes were not worth the wait. It took a good three weeks to get them since the seller is in Korea and returning the item will cost almost as much as the purchase price. Don't even bother with these."
It looks to fake. hard to handle and very big.
cheaply made. Returned them.
Fit good..but the fabric too cheap for the price
"The only problem with those shoes is that the band on the fingers are too tight and you get uncomfortable in a matter of minutes walking.

Other than that, the shoe would be perfect. But they really need to lose way more this band so the fingers don't suffer."
"Wish this fit as it's very comfortable and flattering. But it's made for someone much taller than me, I guess. Or someone with an extremely long torso. The cups at the top sit about five inches above where my actual breasts sit. Very strange fit."
"I like the cut of this shirt, unfortunately the XL I bought runs VERY tight. More like a medium. I bought two and one is still in the package because I just can't wear it. And because of the tightness, I couldn't get the top down to feed so it's doubly useless for me.

However, the pros are the material is soft and the colors are nice. Just adjust for size."
"Very bad quality, it brokes at the first day of wear it. It is not completely gold. Se can not Buy jewelry at Amazon"
I was looking for an everyday sandal and these did not fit the bill.  I expected the cutout pattern to be more of organic shape but it was quite unattractive.  Overall the proportions of this sandal were not flattering on the foot.  I will be returning these.
"I was very disappointed in this ring. The sapphires looked so rich and dark blue on the website, but when I got the ring they were so pale and fake looking.  The ring was also a tight fit for a 7.  Most of my 7's are huge on my fingers, but had I got the size 6 (which I contemplated getting) it would never have fit.  Very disappointed in this ring.  I sent it back. The thing that angered me most was that I paid $20 some dollars to have overnite delivery, and it still came two days later........and what a waste of money to lose that money to have it shipped quickly!"
"My mother said that unlike the other TEVA she has had before this same model these seem low quality, and leave her bad smell on her feet."
Wish I had been able to send them back as I had a knee replaced and cannot wear them at all and I am past the send back date.
"The bust is way to small for this suit, and the bottoms wayyy too large."
"Be careful, there are so many counterfeits of DW watches.  Yes, there are counterfeits of ""inexpensive"" watches too.  I purchased a Dapper St. Mawes from RetroDeals2000 from Amazon Marketplace and received a fake one.  I compared an authentic one purchased directly from Daniel Wellington website and there are obvious differences.  The real one always has engraved wordings on the back case; the fake one has painted on.  The styles of the dates shown inside the watches are different as well; the real one's style is of a taller Times New Roman, while the fake one's is short and bolder.  The fake manual has a blurry picture while the real one's is very clear, crisp and colorful.  There are many other details, but I digress; otherwise, it would take a while to list them all."
Fit was smaller than expect. I ordered a large and it was too small for my brother. And he usually wears a medium.
These fit wrong and I wont.be getting more unless I'm offered them replaced with some that fit.
I bought this March 27 for Easter Sunday- it said Id get it by Friday March 30 but I did not! The shipping immediately changed right after I completed my purchase! Seems a little deceptive! Its alao VERY small! Ive boughg similar blazers on here and always went with a 2x...this was more like a medium! Beautiful color though.
Tore after the first time I wore it
Ordered RED got pink
"These jeans are weird I'm not sure why. I ordered my regular size, the fit is great but I was not able to close the button not even close. So I returned and placed a new order for the next larger size, but still to small. Ordered two sizes up this time, still to small to close."
"purchased these because of the glowing recommendations.  Well, they are not as described. They were pulling up the toenails on my feet through the socks, and I never even got my orthotics in! My foot measures a 6.5 but I get a 7.5 so I have plenty of room for my arch supports.  These were way too small. Worse is that DREW REFUSES To give me a refund! Do not do business with these people! I have $385.00 worth of shoes from them, unworn and in the boxes, they have refused to give me a refund on. Really? Are they that desperate for money? Guess one customer really upsets their bottom line! I have found Merrill's, which fit much much better, are extremely comfortable, and I have yet to put in any orthotics, they are that well designed.  DRew has been living off their reputation as a quality good fitting shoe for too long. I am doubtful of the quality, the fit just isn't there, and they are not good people to do business with.  I think they have been bought by the Chines and no longer give American service!"
"It amazes me that such a lightweight pretty coat can still be so warm, but it is useless to me since the zipper CONSTANTLY gets stuck whether it's trying to zip it up or down."
No don't buy. Terrible quality and so tiny
"My son only wore these for a grand total of 14hrs and the back pocket has worn through & is now a big hole
Won't buy these online again! Paid extra to have the Carhartt name - wasn't worth it"
BEAUTIFUL dress - 'VERY SMALL
Terrible material. Looks nothing like picture. Completely see through! You could even see my underwear lines. I have to send it back because it's awful. Straight garbage!
"Beautiful on the outside, but painful on the inside."
Way too small. Not at all the size it describes. But good quality.
"These shoes run incredibly small. I wear a 9.5 in every shoe ever, but these shoes were a full size too small. They look great and would have probably been my favorite shoe."
These are very much so the most comical version of jeggings I've encountered. That said they are super comfortable and are good for working out or around the house.
"Gift for girlfriend: she thought they were cute, but ultimately they are just too bulky to actually be wearable and she threw them away."
"If you have a larger bust, this is not for you.. the band under my bust kept slipping up and it was also not very flattering. Buy a more expensive and better maternity bra!"
I didn't like these at all. They looked very cheap.
"These do NOT fit as traditional palazzo pants should..much more  form fitting, tapering wider at the ends. While the item fit, it ws NOT flattering for anyone with hips which is the reason one would buy palazzo pants in the first place. I did not send them back as I have a friend with narrow hips and gave them to her.."
Write out of the box you could notice right away all the seams were glued and not made as well as they could be.
very hard and uncomfortable to wear. No give
"These were comfortable and the heavy fabric was nice to have.

They didn't last as long as I hoped though. They all developed huge holes in the bottom. I know boxers aren't supposed to last forever, but my other (same brand) boxers have held up much better."
"I fell in love with this wallet when I got it, first wallet I bought in almost 10 years, the canvas on the inside (right side card holders) has split and torn, I've had the wallet for a few months now, this happened in the first month, but it holds what I need and I do like it, I just expected a lot higher quality from Carhartt."
"My son loved this backpack.  Unfortunately, it only lasted for 2 weeks of school.  The entire bottom of the bag came apart. His school bags normally last the whole school year.  I was really disappointed to have to replace this bag less than a month into the school year."
Runs a little small I am a 14 and ordered a 16 and is still tight.
"Bought these for my son who always wears dickies. They are in a box somewhere. Had to order more Dickies. He is hard to fit. For big and tall workwear, go with the Dickies."
Love the look-but is a little short. Returning them for a bigger size-1/2 size up. Got many compliments on the color!
"Order as big as you can, or better yet... buy from someone else"
I bought it in October and it is already in horrible shape. I would give it zero stars if I could. Its scratched and the metal is peeling off of it. I work in an office so there is no rough use of it. Im so annoyed it is I such bad shape I cant wear it anymore.
Way too big. Thought it would be smaller
"The back strap is too tight but the cups are kinda empty on top. It's meant for perkier people. I try to pick up my boobs and make it fit but I don't go that high. Looks artificial anyway.
Never buying a bra off the internet again."
"It rolls easy.  It is stable.  It is a good size.  It is not very durable.  On my second trip with this, one of the tubes that the extension handle is attached to was bent in airline handling.  It appears another bag may have been thrown on top, and an edge hit the back of the bag.  A fairly common occurrence in airline baggage handling I am sure.  I've had other roller bags for 15 years, and never had one of these tubes get bent.  The tubes are made of fairly light weight aluminum.  Heavier construction or stronger material would have made this type of damage less likely."
"Looks better than picture, really nice prop. Only issue I had was the bullets keep slipping out, one in particular causing the entire belt to come apart. It wasn't a pretty sight chasing bullets and casings while at the Halloween party. I had to take it off before the end of the night so I could enjoy myself."
"This gave me serious cone boobs, I ended up sending it back"
"fits extremely small, not what was expected. for very small tiny woman."
Uncomfortable and rolls down
insatisfecho
"The top is cute but runs very small, almost two sizes.  Other than size it is really cute. xxxxxxxx  xxxx"
"Rating explanation - 5 stars for comfort and support.  Negative stars due to the smell - resulting in 2 stars

I purchased these shoes from a local vendor.  They are exceedingly comfortable for both casual and exercise wear. They offer great support, and are the first exercise shoes I've purchased in years that don't leave blisters on my feet.  I took them to work to wear for lunch time walks, and around the same time began to notice a smell that made me think someone had discarded rotten food in the area.  Then I thought one of my co-workers must have developed horrible body odor.  After a week or so, I took a trip wearing the shoes during my flight.  The smell followed, so of course I thought I had developed body odor!  But, after unpacking and leaving the shoes in the hotel closet for a couple days, the closet began to take on the same odor.  I was able to track the smell back to the soles (not the insoles) of these shoes.  The smell is a horrible gassy/chemical smell.  I found the same complaint not only with other NB models, but other manufacturer's shoes.  Other reviews mentioned it might be due to the shoes getting wet, or the adhesive, and/or a certain type of foam used.  In any case, they smell too bad to keep in the house.  So, I keep them on the patio, and put them on only when walking outdoors.  They're too comfortable to toss, or they would be gone.  Unfortunately, it seems as if the smell didn't fully develop until I'd owned the shoes for several weeks.

And no, it's not my feet causing the shoes to smell.  And yes, I actually made my spouse to a sniff test, comparing my old, well-worn sneakers to these.  It's the new shoes."
"the large was way way too big for a 5'9"" tall, 17-1/2 34/35 shirt cut, 34 waist guy.  the thing was like a nightgown.  gave it away.  material was kinda cool though"
NOT AS EXPECTED.
"What happened to these? I've been wearing them for years. Well, not anymore. The fabric they now use is very rough and they are way tighter and more uncomfortable than before. And , yes, I weigh the same and they are same size as before. They obviously changed manufacturers or something. Anyway...I since ordered some very similar Fruit of the Loom's and they are great. They are just like these USED to be."
I do not know who thinks this is a large. A size 6 is more like it. Very disappointed.
they are not as cute as i thought they might be.
"HATE these sandal's! I will not even ware them to take the trash out.  I have Plantars Faciitis and was hoping this would help cushion my heal but they feel like hard plastic, horrible, horrible."
Top is way to small!
"Top part was too small,length was too long. I bought a different brand in medium that had a bit of spandex it fit much better. Sent this back."
Returning this.  Way to small.  No way this is an XXL!  Don't like the straps that come over your bra.
"They are way too big and come up way too high on my foot...so they look a bit grandma...  For the product, I could have spent half the price at target and they would have fit better."
These leggings are sheer like hosiery. They are not true to size and are not as thick as I like my leggings.
"This was too long & too tight at first but when I washed it and stretched it out a bit, it was better."
Bought for birthday of a senior cancel survivor in nursing home. Very unhappy that the size is off by art least one whole size. Too small to fit cripple's foot...shame...shame.
"pretty sure this wouldn't fit my 12 year old, way too small."
"Sleeves way to long, girth just fits. Deep color purple great."
do not waste your money cheaply made does not look anything like the photo!
its cute but at least two full sizes small
"Siggi, please don't label a hat beige when it clearly is not.  What arrived at my house could be called linen or unbleached muslin, but beige it is not.  The product description model in Amazons photo looks 100% better in this hat than I doit fits her head and lays well.  Perhaps it is the placement of the hats two main side seams and the two wires that run throughout the hats brim that make it so weirdly shaped.  No matter which way I bend the brim, the hat looks floppy, ill-fitting and cheap.  I liked the way the polka dots outlined the rim of the hat, and that they're slightly visible (or at least thats the way the description photo makes it look).  My rim shows no glimpse of polka dots, unless the wires are bent upwardsthen I look like a goofy sailor.

I bought this hat for casual outdoor use, but the very light color will get dirty in no time, so I hope it washes up well.  Ill still use it, but overall, this is a very disappointing purchase.  The hats color is not beige and it just doesnt fit well."
I wear 48 waistline ordered 52 too small?
"Was to let down with this suit. I was planning on going to the beach for the first time since having kids (I had my first 6yrs ago')...and because I am not the 110lbs 5'8 woman I was before having kids I knew I'd need to cover up but I still wanted to feel good...sexy possibly even. I ordered this with high hopes..and when it arrived, I couldn't try it on fast enough.
  I weigh about 165-175lbs at any given time...and ordered an XL....it was gigantic in the bust (I'm a double full D) tight in the thighs to the point I had marks, the belly area bagged but was tight at the same time, It was awful. I then got the next size down and that was like packing 20lbs of sausage into 10lbs wrapper, and that's when I gave up on it. Never the less I have still yet to get a suit I feel good and confidant in enough to go to a beach,,"
Looks very cheap.  I wanted natural stone instead of CZ but there is little to no sparkle with white topaz.  The center stone is abnormally large compared to the other stones.  They are totally see through.  Even the metal looks cheap.  Go with CZ instead.
"Succinctly put, the three reasons why this wallet is useless to me are: it is uncomfortably large compared to my old Dockers wallet, the card pockets are so tight that it is impossible to remove cards and IDs quickly or easily, and the lowest two card pockets are the same depth so that the card in the bottom pocket will cover up the card in the pocket above it rendering one of the four slots per column useless. There is about a centimeter of leather projecting pointlessly above the top of the wallet. If this wallet had been designed with three larger card slots per column for a total of nine slots I'm sure I would have liked it much better. As it is, my old wallet is far superior and I'm stuck trying to stretch out the card pockets to make the Alpine Swiss a little less useless."
"Warning!  It pills when you wash it!  The first time that I washed it it pilled all over the place and everything else that was in that load had the pills as well.  Had to wash it again because I was afraid that my daughter would choke on the pilled fabric.  I CAN""T use it and wish that I had never bought this.  Too bad because it is super cute."
Bought 2 pair. One of them came very warped. They are very delicate and feel pretty cheap (then again they are). I returned and bought another pair that was a couple dollars higher and substantially better quality.
"Online looks like a perfect fit, however, too loose and flimsy."
"Runs very small, not very good quality."
"Buttons stop working after 12 months. No warranty. It is a hassle to communicate with Suunto. They say online ship it to us, spend $40 buck and then we will tell you what is the problem to fix it. Ridiculous. Not durable at all."
"I GIVE IT ONE STAR FOR DESIGN, BUT NOT WORTH THE MONEY I SPENT FOR THEM. ONLY BECAUSE I BOUGHT A PAIR OF POLARIZED SUNGLASSES FOR $10 (SHIPPING INCLUDED) & THESE DONT EVEN COME CLOSE TO THE $10 PAIR.

LENS NOT DARK ENOUGH TO GIVE PROTECTION FROM SUN & I DIDN'T NOTICE ANY DIFFERENCE IN THE SCENERY THROUGH THE LENS, SO I DOUBT THEY ARE POLARIZED"
"I was excited to get this sweatshirt, but unfortunately I wasn't too impressed with it when it arrived. The company ""Rapid Dominance"" is making these sweatshirts in China. The end result isn't too impressive. The shirt has a cheap feel to it and doesn't look that great. I was looking for something to show my pride of my former branch of service. In the end, a cheaply made product that was produced in a communist country and doesn't look that good on me really doesn't show my pride well."
This top was a huge disappointment.  It wasn't worth the time that it took to get to me or the money.  Its flimsy and doesnt fit right.  The top is worth $9.99-12.99 tops!  I returned it.
"It looks really cheap,and it looks like something you can just make urself. However....its pretty."
The show itself was like the pic but length wise about a half size to big and in the strap there were no where near enough buckle holes. The room in the toes even if the length had fit was huge
Looked cheap.  Not what I expected.
"Very cute and eye pleasing but scratched way too much against my skin. I couldn't even wear it for a day without taking it off. It's sitting in my car, can't deal with with the scratchiness"
Way too big. I was going to order a medium but according to the size chart I was a large. I probably could have fit into the small.
See it looks like it has some sort of structure to it. But its just soft and more of a poly blend cardigan
"pretty but uncomfortable, couldn't wear them"
i got the 2x which is about a US small/med. it has a strange smell and the material reminds me of that thin foam stuff that my flat screen tv was wrapped in when i got it. its very very cheaply made and im not sure if the stitching will survive the washing machine. im going to wash it and see what happens and repost the results
Terrible quality. Smells discusting
Dress that arrived is pretty but looks nothing at all like the picture.
"Good fit and support, but a seam is coming undone, this is the second pair of shoes that is has happened to"
Nothing like it was described
"this stuff messed up the cork on my birkenstocks , at first they were sticky now they are hard , birkenstocks are known for their comfort and molding to ur foot , this stuff makes the cork hard and it no longer forms to my foot , I made the mistake of believing it and I put it on 4 pair . boy do I regret that ! I will still ware them , I paid $130.00 each so I'm gonna ware them , but hopefully people read this and don't use this product !!! it messes up ur birkenstocks ! do not believe it ! it does nothing but makes them hard - stiff , and they get hot and get sticky now that they have dried weeks ago when I ware a pair aLL day they still get sticky . biggest mistake ever . do not use this !"
The fur falls out
Sent them back XL doesn't fit thick curvy legs
"Seem good quality, however not true to size. I ordered medium and it was too large."
Not at all true to size. Runs very small and very short. I wish I would've read all of the reviews before purchasing. Looks way better on the model than in person. I ordered a size bigger than I normally get anywhere else and it was still too small.
I am so disappointed. The picture shows silver buckles and zippers and the bag that I received has gold and is flimsy as all get out. I was looking for a sturdy black and silver bag and this is NOT it. I am very disappointed. I will try to return but it may not be worth it.
Waaaaaaayyy too narrow. Do people seriously have feet this narrow?
Very cute but I wish these felt tighter on the head. They slip off so easily...
"I ordered for a trip and it said it would be here before we left. It came while we were away. I ordered an XL, it would better be labeled a men's medium USA."
"I needed a heating pad to help heal a shoulder injury, and I bought this believing it would fit snugly between my neck and the edge of my shoulder.  I was quite mistaken.  The pad seems to work reasonably well in the small of the back or across the back below the neck.  The control allows for a welcome range of temperature.  However, the location of the ""plug in"" for the electrical cord makes it cumbersome to use the pad.  A better design would be to have a cord come out of the pad for several inches before the electrical supply cord attached.  The only way I have been able to apply heat effectively to my shoulder with this pad has been to hold it into place with my opposite hand cupped to force it down onto the area.  The pad seems to be well made, and it heats effectively, but I would not recommend it for areas where the pad could not be fully extended flattened (and the plug-in would not interfere)."
"The purpose of packing cubes is three-fold: keep you organized, save space in your luggage, and help you pack more stuff.

These ebags packing cubes serve the first purpose well, but the second two they only nominally help with. They are fairly sturdy material with quality zippers and nice mesh panels so you can see what's inside and let clothes breath. Unfortunately, each packing cube has a big old bulky thick plastic logo sown on the front, which contributes significantly to the weight, dimensions, and space occupied by the cubes.

As a result of these logos, you're actively losing space in your bag. It might not seem like a lot, but every little bit adds up, especially in vertical packing space. Each time you open your suitcase and wonder why you can't fit more, you'll be reminded of the reason: ebags wants you to know who designed this mediocre product."
"A bit large, thought this was going to be elegant, but it looks bad, like if it was a black curtain."
Stitching broke after one wear.
snug and sheer!
This runs sname....not as expected
"My feet, 6 medium (via usual metal measuring tool). My left, larger; still a 6. Arches, average. Foot shape, between ""tapering toes"" & ""square"" (see pix). At 5'2 & 119, neither are my feet chubby; 58 years, no foot issues. 1/22/16, ordered a 6 med; was long enough, no toe-touching; width, snug. Removed my thin sock, the left was still so snug it squeezed a foot bone which ""moved/clicked"" as I walked. Time won't fix this much ""snug""; my feet deserve wider from the start anyways. INNER sole is completely flat; NO arch despite the looks of the outer rubber sole & reviews raving about ""support"" of which I read 12+ pages before deciding to buy. The ""comfort"" reviews along with the looks of the outer sole led me to presume that the inner might be support-shaped; no, it's flat; hope my pix show that. Inner liner is NOT real sheepskin fleece; it's labeled: ""60% sheepskin; 40% polyester""; zoom to view. ""Stone"" = light & dark taupe. I photo'd it atop my ""Graystone Metallic"" 08 Tahoe (google the color) in sun to compare. Free Shipping; free return; yay Amazon!"
Broke down after two days. Not a quality product.
Backpack straps pulled out of backpack about 45 days after purchase.
"The size says 3T/4T so I expected this to be really big on my small 2.5 year old. It actually ended up just fitting him so he won't be able to wear it for as long as I'd hoped. The stitching was also done very poorly. Many loose strings and a hole on the seam of the hat. It will work for play, but I wouldn't order this again or recommend anyone else order it."
these were missing a least a dozen stones. not even in the box so zero quality control. sent back.
"I ordered these shoes in a 10W in both black and blue.  The black fit perfectly and are so comfortable.  The blue 10W were way to tight.  I didn't realize it until it was too late to return the blue, so on a whim I ordered a second blue 10W, it too was way smaller than the black.  I was able to return the second pair but am stuck with the first (my own fault)."
Bows are cheaply glued on the front of the shoe. One has already come off after only a few hours of wear.
Need to establish a definition of size.
"The gathered detailing at the bust looks strangely lopsided like the center of the bunch is shifted too far to one side, and the waist seam falls in an awkward place on my 5'1"" mom. It's like whoever measured the torso couldn't decide whether it should be an empire or an A-line. The material feels like the stiff, slightly sandpaper-y stuff that Halloween costumes are made out of, and given the quality of the stitching, I'm afraid of washing it even once since it might fall apart. I bought it for a wedding, but it really does remind me too much of a cheap Halloween costume."
"They fit okay and are cute, but the elastic ripped cleanly off one within 6 weeks, and the PACT website kept crashing when I tried to submit a notice about it. Really wanted these to work out (the other one seems to be of higher quality and is comfy and not see through )"
Too tight and I ordered a size up.
This neck stretched out and truth I ended up tossing the shirt out.  I got it in white and had the same affect.
These run very small and dig in at the waist. I wanted something to wear under skirts not something that felt like sausage casing. The Skimmis Slipshort is a much better choice if you want something comfortable to prevent chafing.
"I am a size 9/M-L. I ordered the xxl and it is way too small, more like a size xs."
"This item does not look ANYTHING like the picture. It is significantly smaller, tarnished, looks like it's been sitting in the box for years upon years. I had to shine it before putting it on because it was so dingy. It also turned my finger green."
With some tailoring it would be cute but it fits like a hot pink hefty bag
Case of you get what you pay for. Looked nice in pkg but snapped into two orders when tried to put it on. Guessing it had a flaw but not worth hassle to return it.
Jacket measurements do not fit. Jacket is way too small.
"This is wallet and not a clutch by any stretch of inmaginarion. It is so small, it didn't fit an iPhone 6s with case and my lipstick. It fits money and a phone just like a traditional wallet, nothing else."
"Nice and comfortable, but the quality is very poor. They stretched out of shape and tore apart on the side of the shoe within 2wks."
"The shoe is visually nice, but has a pungent odor!  They almost smell as if they were dipped in gasoline, so I hope my son doesn't blow up at his school dance next month.... :-)"
"fit fine.  simply an ugly shoe.  I'm a grandma and old, but I don't like wearing shoes that look like grandma shoes."
"These are a really adorable design and both my daughter and I instantly loved them, but after one day running around in them the delicate little designs on the blue background had started fraying and little threads were sticking out all of the inner-facing side of the shoes.  It was obvious they'd be torn up and look terrible in a couple of weeks, so we returned them.  Great idea, but no durability at all, especially for  $35 shoe!"
I love wallflower jeans very much. But these are not skinny jeans as much as they are relaxed fit. Disappointed.
"Loved the look and feel of these sun glasses--much like my Maui Jim's.  However broke right in half 5 days after I got them.  At first I thought it was my fault because they were in my handbag without the case, so I threw them away.  But after I thought about it--I have put every pair of glasses I have ever owned in my bag and none of them broke in half.  ""Unbreakable: should not be in this products name.  Should have returned them for a refund.  Too bad --they are nice looking."
DO NOT BUY THIS SHIRT!!! It is total garbage! This shirt was hideous and it smelled terrible!. It smelled like salt and vinegar chips!! The picture on the front was barely legible. Total rip off. I'm requesting a refund.
"First, the true colors are best represented in the last picture. The romper on the model is a lot lighter compared to the thing in person. I ordered a size medium and definitely fits like a small. I'm 5'8 and 130 lbs with stick-like legs and the bottom of the romper was very form fitting to my thighs, not loose in the picture. Overall, I do like it especially for the price."
Worst dress I've ever worn in my life it kept riding up and material list cheap I want a refund I will take this to the Amazon but I want a refund when I got the box package that was even ruined upon receiving the item there were holes in it that I didn't notice until after Christmas family members told me about them I'm disgusted
"I did not receive a ""spaghetti strap tank"", but rather a regular tank.  And the plus size I ordered was so small it just fit a petite friend. Will not order again."
No wire which I thought this had. That was disappointing. I bought this after reading an article about bras with really good back support. It seems like it would but it is just too tight and hard to close in the front with all the hook and eye closures. The cotton isn't very comfortable either. A very grandma type bra.
It shrinks to end up being wider and shorter.
"I am so disappointed.  I wear a 5 or 5.5 D, depending on the shoe.  So I ordered 1/2 size up as recommended, a 6M.  The toe fit fine.  But the heel was so loose, that just walking around the house to try them out, I could tell that I would quickly get a blister as my feet slipped up and down in the heel as I walked.  I was also unable to wear heavy hiking sox with the boot, only normal thickness sports socks.  The reason:  I have a high arch and with the heavier hiking socks on, the top of my foot over my instep was being rubbed uncomfortably by the top of the boot.  With normal thickness socks this was not a problem.  So I had to return them.  I am so sad.  I have been looking for a hiking boot made in the USA that was also comfortable.  It is so difficult to find a small size that is also wide.  I will keep looking"
"I really like these boots, however, after wearing just a few times they have begun making a ""squishing"" noise while walking in them.  I can only assume a hole has developed in the sole.  It would be nice to have  a different form of communication than just the returns option on the orders section."
"I returned both the ones I'd ordered. The fit was funny, stitching uneven, and neither looked like it would hold up to more than a couple of washings. A pity because they look great in the pictures. Maybe they'd fit better on a tall, lanky person, I don't know."
"If you think what you're getting is represented with the pictures, you're wrong. This entire webpage is a complete lie. Nothing is the right size and unless you're a midget nothing will fit a 32 inch waist or larger. No room for your package. They look like they fit a woman!"
"My size is usually Large or XL.  I went with XL based on the listing.  It barely fit and then only as a sort of low-rise.  The product is basically--and feels like--an athletic supporter.  There is no elastic around the legs so the material slides toward the center.  Fabric is a thin mesh and began to pull apart on first wearing.  Material, by the way, is 93% polyester-7%spandex."
Pulls down and apart.  Not very flattering.
"Just like others, I too question the authenticity of these sandles.  I have purchased multiple pairs of the same sandles (different colors) the last 3 years and they are not the same in quality and overall look.  They are much shorter, the foam looks cheaper, and the Teva symbol on the heel is different.  The quality is far inferior to my past Teva purchases. Worn once, and will return if that's an option."
"The picture makes these glasses look much cuter than what they actually are.  They are very cheap looking and the color is not nearly as vibrant as the picture. We ordered the purple.  I would not recommend that color. When I wear them, I look like a little girl playing dress up.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Since I break sunglasses frequently, they won't last long anyway."
"To be fair, I don't inherently dislike the actual product. I do wish it was a bigger size, but that is neither here nor there. What disappointed me is the fact that I ordered a cute purple coin purse with butterflies and I received a boring black and white one. The style was completely wrong. I just decided to keep it as it would be a hassle to pay for the return and get it to where it needs to be and wait to see if I actually get the one I want back. It functions how it is supposed to. I guess I just need to buy these items at an actual Vera Bradley store."
Very small. I'm 5.3 and 165lb. I ordered extra lg and the item was more like a US small size! and short! Very disappointed!
Cheap cheap cheap material. Returned it.
Ridiculously small! I ordered an XL because I'm busty I don't like them tight. This thing is a medium at best!! It's pretty otherwise and the quality seems great but it's only meant for tiny people who think they are larger than they really are.
"very cheap material,  but did not have any problems returned it"
Color is very different than in  the photo.  I returned mine.  Fit is nice but color is more of an orangy-pinkey color that is not very flattering.
"These are not for snowy winter activities....they are for 30-40 degree days going shopping or around town.  IMO they do not work well as liners. I have a pair of liners that are cheaper, warmer, and thinner so you can move your fingers better.

I was very disappointed with them."
"Very poor quality and one was coming apart at the seam. They are flimsy and loose fitting and too high priced for what they are, a dust rag."
I RETURNED THIS IT WAS A MISTAKEN  ORDER.
"Absolutely no shape to it whatsoever!  The sleeves don't even have shape near the wrist.  It's just boxy looking.  I ordered a medium and although the tag on the dress said ""medium,"" I could have easily put 2 of me in this dress...It's enormous.  Returning it."
Disappointed........I bought these in brown and loved them but these in black just kept rubbing the top of my toes to where I couldn't walk without pain. I have the brown ones in this style and the Chukka boot as well and both fit fine. Thanks to Amazon for the return. I'm going to have to find a black comfortable casual dress shoe that comes in widths.
Never received
Such a rough and scratchy fabric!
I did not like these earrings really
"Decrease in quality on this model.  I've lost weight now legs are tighter?  Stitching on waist is like sandpaper.  Gotta wear em inside out.  Improved, softer my ass!"
"Update: I've worn them twice and the heel is cut so sharp it has literally given me blisters and sliced my skin. They make a popping/snapping sound when you walk under your heel, so everyone stares. The noise I can handle, but the awful edge around your heel (and even around the top of your foot) cuts into your flesh making a whole day at work loud AND painful.  You should Pass. Let me be the one that wasted the money on them.

These are not $90 shoes so do not buy these style in any color for that price. That said, I thought these black dotted were ok in person. They were too big and I got an 8.5. I always wear a 9, but you may try a whole size down. They got baggy inside the arch and leave a gap, which I think looks sloppy.  Idk I think if you have fuller/thicker feet you can probably fill them out nicely.  My feet are average.  The other pair (white/tan) I got in 8.5 fit fine.  I kept the tan/white ones. Returned the black dotted ones."
"They are darn good imitation but they are not in any way related to a cow.  Very disappointed . If the shoes were much, much cheaper and the page hadn't claimed leather it would be ok but neither of these are the case. Let the buyer beware.  Other than that shoes are cute and fit decently but are at least a half size small."
Nice chain but challenging hook.
"I am disappointed in the readability of this black watch. The crystal is curved instead of flat and the black face is concave. This seems to sometimes result in shadows and reflections that can make the hands difficult to see at times. I had hoped that the gold on black would be easier to read. I just noticed one of the customer review pictures shows this too. I afded two of my own. I intend to return, perhaps getting the white face which might not have the same issue. I purchased a lower priced Biden watch for $11 (regularly $15) which seems to be a better value having a sapphire crystal and luminescent hands as well as a nicer box if gifting. I don't know of these low priced watches will hold up but I have a $15 Casio that has been put through two years of abuse and is still going strong."
"Cheap, and it looks it!!!"
wide is definitely not a wide!
color was closer to black then burgandy
Does this work with the note 4?
Never again buy they are easy to tear up
"it's cheap junk, came all in peaces"
This product leaves indents on my 6 month olds face when it's on its biggest setting.
Very small and kinda un-even. Its cheap for a reason....
"It kind of ""puffs"" by the sides... :("
"Bought for a star wars REY costume. Worked great for 2 days.
Pilled up after 2 days, so I won't be wearing them out of the house."
The fit and material isn't great
Way Way too large and bulky.  I sent this back
runs very small. Dresse is beautiful
I did not like these at all. Very soon they lost their shape and the rear of this shoe started slipping off my heel. I use these to wear inside my Uggs but given their price per pair I find it hard to recommend it to anyone
Smelled weird and I didn't like the color at all.. way more yellow then the picture
I understand that this is supposed to be tight but JEEZ I cant even pull it over my body with out losing all oxygen. I bought this to make those night outs better but there is absolutely no point if I can not move. I bought my size and I am not saying that it doesnt fit I am just saying that I like to be able to breathe when I go out and this product does not allow that for me.
"I was very disappointed with these earrings.  I love moonstones and own many, but these were not as described or shown.  They clearly state that they are rainbow moonstones that capture the entire color spectrum with every movement.  This statement is simply not true.  The earrings I received are completely white.  In addition, one of the stones is cracked.  I will be sending these back.  They are not worth $30."
"donated it, was too small and almost see through."
fabric and style is not what i expected.
I normally wear a size small but from the reviews I ordered a large.  It is still skin tight and is miserably tight in the knees.  I won't be able to wear these.  Very disappointed.
It's cheap and won't last long but at $17 I guess that's what I deserve..
"Very dissapointed, i ordered medium but they gave me large which is toooooo large i think this is XXXL but they insist i ordered large ok fine if i ordered large this is toooo BIG i think XXXL.
So very dissapointed."
"The dial is big and initially I was content, assuming that's what we get for that price.
But, compared to a lot other watches under the same price-range, this is a very cheap looking one.
The strap has worn out already and I haven't even worn it twice until now.
Please do not go for this. You deserve better!"
"I was so excited about these because I had read so many reviews citing them as having wide calves, but was disappointed when it didn't come close to zipping up around mine. They are high quality boots and I am sure they hold up well, but I had to return them because I could not zip them. Wide calved people, be warned!"
These do not fit well just an honest review.
"First time I put these on, the toe seam busted open."
It's more of a strap than a belt
"The color purple I got didn't come near to matching the picture, it was very light purple which was a big bummer."
"Just got it, looks too cheap to wear."
They might fit a 4 year old.  Definitely not for a older teens foot.
"These pants look good and have a nice feel. And, unlike many new slacks today, they are not lint magnets. And the fit is good. But what good is all that when holes quickly start developing (not tears or rips) in the fabric? The material starts wearing out after just a couple of months."
"while I love this brand and thought these shoes would be good for fall, HOWEVER the Velcro in the back did not stay closed making them useless & I had to return them"
I thought this was a quality wallet and the cat's meow when I bought it.  Nice thin style and enough room for all the important cards.  1-1/2 years later it is literally falling apart at the seams.
Was ridiculously small .....
Ring was pretty but stone looked like glad not a diamond.
it wasn't the right fit for me
ordered a medium and it's HUGE!! Had to give to my 8 month pregnant sister.
Color was trendy but not appropriate for my husband's age bracket.  Jeans were far longer than comparable pair of Nauticas that he loves.
Love the style but they shoe was way to big in the front.
"They're cute, but not worth the price. I barely tried 1 on and they already broke."
Frame Leans to the left
cheap and itchy
I bought the bag a while ago but didn't use it until now. Right away zippers were breaking and things were falling off. Plus the leather feels very cheap. I wish I could get my money back but it might be too late.
They change colors there not gold no more
way too small-i bought an xl-fit more like a medium.
"This took almost well over a month to arrive. When it did arrive I was very disappointed. It does not look nowhere as cute as in the picture. the dress is more of a square shape, meaning more on the boxy side. It is long, which I liked, but the colors are dull and it gives off the look of a moo moo. The martial is very thin, which by looking at this picture it seems thicker.  Right away I noticed that they dress sleeve was covered in black maker, that must have soaked through whatever they were writing on.  I contacted the seller, and they agreed to return it, but I decided it wasn't worth the effort, given I only made 14 bucks. I will just cover it with a cardigan and use the dress to wear on play dates or as an outfit to wear around the house on lazy days. Do not get if you want what's in the picture, that is not what you are going to get."
"I am really sorry to say, this pendant is so super small! if you like really dainty than go for it. The blue is pretty and clear. the chain is super cheap also. I had higher expectations for there products I am sending them all back and I ordered a lot! Just cheaply made however very pretty blue which is what drew my attention to this jewelry."
Great blue color but had to return. They are very narrow which is why i said somewhat small but then they are long.  If your child has narrow long feet these may work but my son regular to wide feet.  These are almost misshapen?
"I love the feel of the fabric and the nice bright, white color.  However, this bra is way, way too small for my large bosom.  When I wear this nursing bra to sleep, my bosom falls right out of this bra like I'm wearing nothing at all, rendering it useless.  I can't even wear it around the house in the daytime much, because the bosom pops or slips out.  The support is pretty good, but the cup sizes are too small for the D-cup range."
Not that heavy and easy to stretch out compared to the Gildan
I will be returning these shoes. They look they would be comfortable the front of the shoe is very narrow making it uncomfortable and I have average width feet.
This shoes is not what I expected! Looks nice but fits horribly. The material is too hard. Runs small! First time I bought this brand and would not buy again!
"These are HUGE, even with thick hiking socks.  I am a solid size 6 in almost every brand and I am swimming in these.  The heel fits very strangely and there is a lot of heel lift when walking, which I imagine will lead to lots of blisters.  I returned one pair, but am stuck with another pair that I bought for my daughter for summer camp around Christmas time and didn't think to have her try until now (too late to return them).  They are quickly becoming door stops as I have absolutely no use for them."
"This product fails to mention that it is for women.  Extremely misleading.  Whether by design or mistake, I through my money away on something I can't wear.  The title should read Camouflage Women's Joggers Sweatpants. Even the size chart just says  S M L LG etc...  If you think you know what size you wear you're doomed if you're a guy.  If you're confused, then and only then do you find out that they are WOMEN'S JOGGING Pants."
"Bought two Playtex bras from this seller as replacement for a discontinued Playtex bra that I wore for years and years ( Playtex # 4138).

This bra (Playtex # 4913) I will be returning for an exchange to a different style because the quality of it is VERY poor, with lots of cheap plastic parts (strap loops and band hooks). It's unevenly sewn together and the seams are off, so there's no way it'll last for repeated washings and wear. But that's NOT a seller problem, that's a Playtex problem! It also fit weird, kind of baggy along the bottom of the cups next to the underwire, like I was wearing a sock instead of a bra. But that's likely a function of the cup style, which is two thin layers of fabric rather than thick molded cups, which I'm used to. As a size DD cup, fit and lift is critical to a comfortable and attractive fit. This won't work for me at all. Too bad because the color and style are very pretty on the hanger.

This seller was fairly quick in getting the items to me, and very helpful/responsive when there were weather related shipping delays. Would buy from them again. Meanwhile, I'll be exchanging this for a different style in the hopes that I can find a permanent replacement for my favorite but now discontinued Playtex bra (# 4138)."
"Fits great but looks like an old worn out shirt!
I was expecting nautical quality, which is obviously lacking. Has to go back."
Ran small had to return it.
"Last update..... After some back and forth with emails the sellers refunded me the full amount I paid for the purse.

Another update.....heard back from the seller. They requested I have it fixed myself and and are willing to refund me a whole $10. REALLY????? PLEASE BE WARNED. THEY SELL JUNK AND ARE NOT WILLING TO REFUND YOU ALL THE MONEY YOU SPENT. THEY ARE A RIP OFF!!!!! I am pissed!!!

When I first received this purse I loved it. Now I HATE IT!!! The one main zipper is broken. It will never zip closed properly.  See picture I posted. I will never buy a purse on here again!!! I'm going to try to contact the seller but I bet I'll be lucky to get my money back!! 

I'm a very picky person when it comes to purses. I get one I like and use it till it falls apart and  I love this. All the pockets make it so easy to keep organized, which is why I'm so picky. I like an organized purse. It took a long time to get here, but I'm very glad I ordered it. I love the backpack feature. Makes it so much easier to carry, especially if it's a long day"
"It was too snug for my expectation. I bought a small. I'm 126 lbs. 34-26.5- 36.
It was also too long..like at least 2 -3 inches if you are not wearing a footwear..
Definitely not recommended for work.
I bought the olive color and returned it.
I bought it through Amazon prime,  it also showed to have free returns.
But when i was about to return it, they said it is not covered for free return..and that I had to pay for my shipping. Thus ended up paying to return this thing back !"
Cheap looking.  I doubt it I'll wear it!
Sadly... I was sent the wrong shoes. I am jealous of all the people who said the Plaid Brown shoe was so cute???? I never received them. I was sent a pair of solid black velvet-like shoes. Did not like the crushed velvet look at all. Really needed the Plaid Brown ones to match a specific outfit. Too BAD! I did return them for full refund.
"Darker blue then shown. I am 5'8 156lbs and these ""thigh high"" socks come just below my knee cap. That was the biggest let down fifteen bucks wasted. I could have lived with the off color but I was looking for thigh highs not high calf socks. x( FAIL"
I love the look of these shoes but they were too small :(
"Not only is it not for Kids, because it is way too big, the brim arrived totally wrinkled! rendering it unwearable!"
The material as flimsy and would be easily stained.
"These pants are terrible. im 5'10 almost 5'11 and ive never had a problem with pants till now. I ordered a M regular and i look like a worlds biggest loser contestant trying his old pants on. Im 175lbs athletic build and have a 30 waist. I had to order a M because of fact that their S is to small on me.  But its wayyy too much. Its extremely baggy on the pants sides. Its not tapered in the slightest. They look decent with knee pads on but without, they look gross."
very poor quality.
"These tanks fit pretty small, if your looking for a loose fit tank top, or if your an average size man, these are not for you"
Fits very awkward. The top is way larger than the bottom half. I wish I had never gotten this item
"I have purchased Acorns in the past and they usually run a bit large. This pair was way too small; in fact I could hardly get it on so I returned them. They were nice looking but in addition to not fitting, they were heavier than what I wanted. I did not reorder a larger size."
"Sucks, they're SO cute, but WAYYYYYY too small. I have a large athletic bottom, but am consistently a size-7, I couldn't even get it past my mid thigh!"
"The shoes are lovely, but!  they are too wide (B Medium does not work for my AA feet).  The Clark brand does seem to fit better than others, more support for fallen arches, but I guess I will stick with lower heels.  These days I am built for comfort, not for style."
"Setting is OK, but the CZs look like plastic.  The CZs are very very low grade."
picture is very deceiving...total trash. very dismayed
"I had these shoes bookmarked for two months before splurging, so I was disappointed to find that they didn't meet my expectations on several fronts.

1. proportion - there's something wrong with the scale of these shoes from a design standpoint. They're just bigger and clunkier than any photo reveals. This is magnified once they're on the feet. I have a closet full of chunky shoes, but these just make me feel like a clown. Not funny.

2. fit - I have wide feet, but there was too much space on the sides for a secure fit; consequently, my ankles buckle constantly.

3. weight - for a ""foot friendly"" shoe, these are far too heavy to be of any significant benefit.

4. hard to put on, take off - admittedly, I'm impatient when it comes to donning shoes. I want to be able to slip them on, buckle and go. But these require me to sit and wiggle my feet into what is actually a pretty narrow passage way more reminiscent of a boot than a sandal.

In sum, these shoes are an example of something that looks better on the rack than on the feet. I can't recommend them; I can't even manage to resell them, sigh."
"I had a c-section almost a  month ago.  I knew this and wanted to order in advance so I could wear this home.  I even  went to the website and completed the questions in order to get an accurate size.  The thing STILL does not fit; I was very swollen from the IV when I left the hospital and I've lost 20 lbs. When I got home,  I couldn't get it up my thighs.  Now I can, but can't close it. I wanted to use this ASAP its just sitting in my drawer.

I'm pretty disappointed, especially because thus was so expensive."
"love these shoes,  I wish they had in wide width though.  I usually where a 7. got a 7 and they were a little tight . I would go up a 1/2 size."
Glue came apart on the sole
It fell apart the very first time I wore it the whole side split out. I would not buy it again.
"Shirt is very large, definietly go a size down. As for the 2/5, the shirt does have a nice fabric, but it just isn't made well. The picture on amazon is almost misleading, with the perfectly overlying pattern and pocket, it makes it feel like a luxury shirt(together with the price tag), but in all honesty, it's not there. It's hard to button it off without breaking any strings :/"
"I didn't love the fit. It's not that it's too small. Rather, there is too much room in the abdomen and butt while the waist borders on tight. Just not a comfortable or flattering fit."
"It was okay. Perfect size, perfect color. Like I said, it was okay...until one of the buckles broke within two weeks. Now it's useless."
"First off - I'm 5'3"" and 140 lbs. so I'm not in the best shape of my life but the size is just weird... I felt it was big on me which I figured since I'm on the higher end of the scale, it would fit a little more snug. It doesn't flatter - it just hangs off of you. The model in the picture has to be smaller than me and it fits bigger on me than her. I'm sure they pinned or clipped it in the back.  I'm just unimpressed with this - especially since it had relatively good reviews."
"much too large compared to the comparison brand I also bought thru amazon.  both sleeves & body were way too big.  Hope it was just mislabeled in size.
I returned."
"I ordered a half size  bigger than usual just in case, and they were too small!"
I ordered a 24 inch and received a 16 inch.
WAY WAY WAY TOO SMALL!
I ordered 61/2 they came with 2 sizes written. The bottom inside said 6 and under the top it says 61/2. They feel like 6. I like the heel being raised a bit but will not order again. Will stick with Keds they fit much better.
background appear off white in picture but is actually yellow.
"I put in a combination according to instructions, locked and unlocked it with nothing in it. I thought all was fine, so I put things in, locked it - and it never would unlock again. My husband used wire cutters to get the lock off - it went in the garbage can."
"I seriously have a battle with this thing every time I try to put it on.  I hop around the room, swear, and struggle, until I finally manage to pull up down.  And I'm not overweight at all!  After its on, if you happen to sweat anywhere on your chest, somehow this thing makes it worse.  It not only doesn't absorb, but seems to repel sweat onto anything it touches."
"I'm 5'4"" and these didn't even reach above my pubic bone. They are unwearable. Soft and cute, but unwearable."
"I was very excited to get these shoes to try on but they were so painful I could only try them on for a few minutes.  The elastic that secures the shoe on the back of your heel was so unbelievably tight it left an indention on my foot and was super uncomfortable.  I loved the color and the design, but the fit was very disappointing."
"The corset was really small for a large, I would have returned it but the restocking fee was too high."
"I just love this ring & I would have given a 5 star but, after having it for only a week or so the one little diamond stones fell out :("
"This was a huge disappointment! I ordered this watch as an upgrade for my $25 Ironman because I assumed that the extra features would be beneficial. I was wrong, the whole piece slides around inside the watch casing sometimes making the mode or stop button stick. I was better off with my trusty 6 year old 30 lap ironman watch."
Odd fit. Returned
"The boatneck is too wide, so bra straps show. Wearing a tank underneath doesn't work at all. It's soft, but it just wears kind of uncomfortably/strangely in places. It'll work layered under a fleece vest or jacket. Disappointing, though."
"Returned, cheap and flimsy material"
"Update:  After wearing this since Christmas,  four months, the silver coating has all chipped off and it looks horrid.  I'll have to toss it.  This makes me sad and angry.
 Loved this.  Met my daughter after Christmas ( we live several states away) kept one gave her the other."
"Unless you look like an underwear model, they won't look good on you. Fabric is comfortable, but really missed the mark with fit. They are tiny. There is no pouch to speak of either."
I don't know what kind of glasses people use but this cases are Way too small for any of my Ray-Ban sun glasses. It's not even 2x3 inches.
"After 2 years of use I have to downgrade my previous 3 star to 2 star. It worked ok but the early issues I observed are worse now. When you start to fill it up to capacity, the weight balance when upright shifts toward the front and the feet of the suitcase are too close to the center to prevent it from toppling. One of the screws securing the top handle was loose and I had to keep tightening it after each trip; it finally got lost during my last trip. Also during my last trip (February 2016) I was travelling with Air Canada and for the first time I was denied using this bag as carry on because it was too big. Sure enough it was about 2 inches too long to fit in their dimension checking thingy."
"Instantly broke. Never even got to wear it. By the way, I have very small wrists so it's not like I stretched it out."
I am keeping it but just barely. It doesn't side smooth and the straps don't stay up very well. Since that it an ongoing issue with me and my body I'm dealing with it but that's about it.
"Purchase these for my 13 month old daughter. Very cute shoe, but returned because the sole of the boot is made out of some sort of foam material (much like a firm flip flop sandal). The bottom also had a odd felt like material on most of it. A bit slippery for a novice walker and for laminate flooring. Now I understand why the price was so low. Would not recommend if you are looking for a sturdy bottomed winter boot. I would expect more form the OshKosh brand."
Looks like it came out of a cracker jack box
"Arrived bent in half, not what I was expecting at all!"
Careful when choosing the size. It will shrink alot after washing. Loved the shirt before the wash not gotta lose a some weight fo it to fit again.
"Ordered 2 sizes up and still doesn't fit. Not impressed with quality either, returning."
"Poorly made. A stone fell out, the second time I wore it!
It was too late to return it. I am left with a $75 broken bracelet! I loved that bracelet, it fit perfectly."
"The Nike Air sole is a huge gimmick and doesn't seem any different than any other shoe. Way too expensive for what they are. The leather is too soft to be stable for the foot in a wedge. They look okay, but only if you have delicate legs. Do yourself a favor. If you're looking for a comfortable, low wedge, go with Lifestrides or Aerosoles. Both are great values and much more comfortable."
I'm giving this a one star because it  reeked of cigarette smoke. The fact it was WAY too small is just an unfortunate reality. The coat is super warm and soft and looks great on...
"The arch support hit my foot in the wrong place. Sadly, I had to return them. Also, didn't like the bronze on black look. They look more bronze than black."
"They are not safe on wet grounds. This is not a comfortable shoe, makes your feet look fatter than they are."
I've had these shoes just over 6 months and the sole is already worn and split.  I've never had a pair of dress shoes last so little of time.  I switched to these for a more classy look but I'll be going back to my old brand.  They at least lasted me over a year.
"It was a doll size, if I was that small I would not have to waist my money, I was a size five do to prolong steroids for my illness, it's giving me the belly and do to surgeries I am not allowed to go to d gym.  Like I said, I spend a lot of money n ready to stop"
memory foam made them to tight on my foot
Bought a cpl of pairs over the last cpl years .This last pair was to small even after ordering a 1/2 size bigger then I needed
Run small and poor fit.
was disappointed that they were a full size too small....they were marked the correct size but didn't fit.  Bought my first pair two months ago at Nordstrom size 11.5 and they fit perfectly so 11.5 is my correct size.
Huge was ok but the ends were not as big. Did not work with my glasses. Returned them.
nay
They were just wayyyyyyyy too big for MY taste!
"Pink tin foil! No thanks! Could be cute for a little girl to use as ""dress up"" clothes for play. Very disappointed the description nor pictures mentioned the metallic pink tin foil all over the skirt :("
"Cute but ridiculously too small.  I wear a 9, ordered a 10, and still too small.  Poor, very poor sizing.  I would need an 11, maybe an 11.5!"
"I am a true 10, ordered the 41, way too small-ordered up thinking they would be more comfortable, they were not.  I thought for the money, they would be like ""walking on clouds.""  Not so.  Little support.  Rough around the edges, literally.  Both pairs are being sent back.  I did give it 2 stars because of styling.  The red leather has a nice look, and that is about it.  I just didn't feel the need to go through the pain to ""break them in."""
This never worked piece of crap. This product does not do what it was suppose to do. Cheap and crappy.
Tunnels are too short and the o-rings are hair thin and worthless
I can not get my money back and they want me to jump through hoops.  dress falling apart!!!!! Not worth the money.  I will try to get it fixed.  I will not order from them again.  Worst dress that I have ever bought!!!!!!!
The band which make these uncomfortable
"asics seems to have changed their shoes. i've worn them for years and now my regular size is too small and I cant find one that fits I,ve tried larger size, then I tried wider and nothing works.  I returned this pair."
"The bottom of the bras where it attaches rubs the heck out my skin,I tried everything o cover it so it wouldnt rub. I can not wear them"
fell apart the 1st time they were worn
"I was definitely not impressed with this product.  I had not even used the thigh highs once and as soon as I took them out of the packaging I saw what appeared to be a run on one of the legs.  When I put them on, sure enough, there was a run on the left leg (I bought them brand new).  Not impressed, and never got to wear them!
  BUT I will say this.  The company did a great job with getting the product shipped in a timely and efficient manner."
"So, large they fit my spouse who has feet that are at least 3 sizes bigger than I."
Opened package and a string of pearls was hanging! So that tells me its junk.
After a month and a half the inside of shoe is coming apart
"The clasp broke off, pretty cheap on how it holds on"
"My husband bought these because the description says extra cushioning and flexibility. But he did not find this to be true. He's on his feet all day and needs some cushioning. Also the description says 22 ounces which is lighter than some of the other wolverines are listed as. But the ones he got were almost 28 ounces (size 10D). His 5 year old steel toe Wolverines weigh 28oz and he wanted something lighter. For the last two years he's been wearing a Craftsman boot that weighs 22 oz. He didn't like the extra weight of these Wolverines, and the lack of cushioning."
"Gorgeous shoes, but WAY too large!  I'm baffled as to why people are saying they are true to size.  They are LARGE - at least .5-1 size larger!  Also, asian sizes have a very large heel and short toe area - this doesn't work for me.  i got 3 sizes, none were wearable due to extreme pain."
"There is a wood chunck coming up in the boot on the heel, can't even wear"
"I recently returned these sandals.  I received them as a gift in April 2012.  They were my favorite sandals, and I was sad to have to part with them!!  They were very comfortable.  But, I live in Maine where we are cold  and not in sandals for 8 months, and they only lasted a summer and a half.  I looked down one day and the left sandal was coming unglued from the tread--half of the glue was gone on one side.  Upon further inspection, the right sandal's toe was unglued.  I followed the washing instructions; however, I suspect that the washing may have been the problem.  Not sure.  But, they certainly STUNK after a few days on my lovely feet, so the washing machine was the only option.  They were great for the first year.  For something so expensive, I was really hoping to get at least one more year out of them.  Oh well!  Looks like other people have had problems with them falling apart.  It has been a really wet summer, so they have been wet more than they have been dry this year."
"I bought these about a year a ago in Myrtle beach on vacation. I figured the would break in over time like most shoes. They did not. I live in Michigan so we only have summers for a few months but the many times I tried to wear them, I ended up getting major blisters because of the actual rubber piece between my toes. I wear thing sandals all summer long with no problems but these are cheaply made in my opinion with sharpe rubber that just irritates your skin causing blisters. I have 3 other pair of sidewalk surfers and the yoga thong sandal both of which are very comfortable. This product is similar to the cheap thongs you'd buy at Walmart... Choose another sandal."
I was surprised at the discomfort given the reputation of the Brand Name.
These are made for a thinner foot than mine.  They are so cute!!  I would recommend these if you have a very thin foot.
Dress is way too small. Should have listed to some of the reviews. I usually wear a 20 but I ordered a 22 since it said it was a bodycon fit. Figured this would give me a little more room. Could hardly get it on/off. So I ordered a 24. Same thing. Didn't fit any bigger than the 22.
"Have to agree with many of reviewers that durability is an issue. First day used for less than an hour and already had a tear in the toe of left sock (apparently somewhat common). Also heel will slip off in various situations so maybe the silicone pad needs reworking too? or the cut of the heel cup?

For ref: bought large size, have US 12-D feet

I highly suggest the manufacturer substitute the cotton for nylon or a similarly tough synthetic and make a third size from 11 and up."
I tried these and my daughter kept getting inflamed. They are difficult to remove because you have to tear them or take your children's clothing off every use. I switched to huggies and have not had any skin issues since the switch
"Great concept, but very wide opening at the ankle.  It made my ankles look like bird legs in wellies rain boots.  I had high hopes for these but will continue the search."
"Washed it once, got a hole in the front. Cheap piece of junk I guess. Wolves cannot go in the washing machine."
"Good fit, but very baggy at the ankles! Wore them once, now they are snagged all over because I washed them! Do not buy these. Very expensive for an extremely poor product."
Bad quality. The white paint was all over the bracelet and looked like it was cheap because it covered the gold trimming.
"These shiny, scratchy capris are not worth the (admittedly low) price. They are cheaply made and highlight every defect. They feel gross and the fabric is thin. Spend a little more and get something better."
The back is way Too Short! Not satisfied
not the shirt in the photo!
Looked cheap ...I returned it
"TERRIBLE DO NOT ORDER. Used this kit to resize my husband's watch. Two of the tools broke IN the pin holes and we had to use another tool to try and get THAT one out, which then promptly broke as well. Cheap tools, terrible quality. I bought the watch as a gift for my husband, and since it wasn't a cheap watch, we should have just taken it somewhere. But we figured buying tools would save us time and money. Now the watch has been slightly damaged because of the tools. I seriously regret buying this tool set. If you hate your enemy, buy him this resizing tool kit."
"This is very very cute and I was very excited to get it.  However, it is still cute but I would consider it a size 0 or smaller.  It looks as though to fit a small child.  It was still very attractive though."
"Ride too much on the rear area especially if you are a plus size woman, no support, just a pretty pantie."
"Looks good, but did not seem to stay in place. All color is coming off belt buckle and I never have it showing since my shirts are all untucked.  It shouldnt be that easy to rub off."
"I got these shoes for a very formal work event, they were SO cute I loved them to pieces, however, the heel of one shoe literally fell off about an hour into the evening.  I tried to contact the seller but never received a response...pretty crummy...they are so cute but apparently you shouldn't expect to walk in them at all"
"This was a disappointing purchase. The ring fits fine, but it doesn't really look like it does in the Amazon image. The blue features are hardly visible and not as bright as they appear in the image. For $2.99 (plus about twice that for S&H) it's tough to get upset, but there is no way I would ever pay the list price of $49.99 for this ring and so it's wasn't really the deal it appeared to be. It supposed to be titanium but has no heft. Not worth returning but I doubt I'll be wearing this."
Back light is very dim. Sending it back. Terrible for seniors!
"I've bought these shoes twice so far. My mom loves these shoes. She works outside and she just absolutely loves these shoes. But after a month a wearing them, I have to buy her another pair since they're so low quality. They tear and split and just fall apart. My mom doesn't even have a manual labor job. She works outside with plants, not lifting anything heavy or running any marathons in these shoes yet they still fall apart on her. If these weren't her favorite shoes (solely based on appearance) I'd never buy from this seller again."
"This is probably the most comfortable bra I have ever had on, but the cone look it gave is embarrassing and not wearable."
BreaKS very easy! Huge! Not for small framed women
Love the color and look but the toe color only lasts about 3 wearings.
"I had a very good experience with another hat made by Bailey of Hollywood. Unfortunately, this hat did not live up to the same expectations. This fedora is cheaply made from a soft flannel that makes it nearly impossible to shape the hat as you prefer. Once you have shaped the hat, the slightest touch will change the look - and not for the better. My experience with the Stetson fedora (I know - who thought Stetson made anything other than cowboy hats?) was far better. So skip this large piece of loose felt and spend your money on the Stetson. You will be glad that you did!"
"I bought 4 pairs of these. Kids wore them 2 days. After the third kid had an awful spill because of three shoes, I just donated them. (I couldn't return because the kids did wear them)
They are much to floppy and loose around the front of the foot. But shoes that are adjustable so the foot is more secure.
First kid his got caught under his bike, big crash, then he was running in the driveway and tripped over the toe, another bloody crash.
2 yr old had 2 big face plants and final straw was my 4 year old daughter was running (not even fast) and these floppy shoes tripped her and she smashed her face.
I never let the other kid wear his and just tossed them all. What a waste of my money. But new sandals that are adjustable are cheaper than teeth.
These are awful shoes. Super cute yeah, but no good."
Too small and the material was not soft.
These are cute...but the price makes me give them a 3 star...they look like $5 drug store shoes. I am keeping them though becuase they are cute and I just won't think about how much I paid for them!
"Way too small. Shrunk even more when washed in cold water. Not a good product, don't waste your money."
XL Fit way to small on me and I'm 5'4 165 pounds. Cant zipper back or raise my arms. Also came with a huge rip in the arm. So dissapointed.
"Way to small since I have no idea what it look likes.  I ordered it on January 24, 2015 and have yet to receive it...today is March 18, 2015.  The tracking number is a joke......If i ever get to actually hold it and check out the material and put it on my head, I will let you know how well it fit.  At this point one star is being generous.  Good luck with any one else that has ordered this hat.  I hope it is lined with money when i get it so at least i will know it was worth waiting for."
"These are not soft. If you're used to scratchy cheap t-shirts, this will be up your alley. Unfortunately, and I may be a little ballsy to say it, but this junk shouldn't be anywhere near your junk."
moves around
"it's a light shoe- I get it, not the beefy running shoe that you can go miles and miles in...but if I kept buying these things I'd go through a pair a month!  I am training for an Ironman, so yeah- I run quite a bit, but my weekly mileage doesn't usually top 25-30 miles.  I would suggest a Brooks running shoe if you're really going to run in these.  Otherwise, yeah- they're great for cross training in the gym and looking cute when you're getting groceries, but a true ""running shoe"" they are not."
Returned.  Fit was irregular and didn't and wasn't a flattering shape.
lens fall off alot
Very small for plus size.
"Very pretty, however, the mask was more of a yellowish white than pure white.  Also there was a huge black dot in the middle of the mask.. I wonder if the people who pack items into the box look at what their packing.. This dot was very noticeable.. I wish there was a way to insert a picture so u guys can see for urself"
Cheap material. Its not the same color as in the picture. It's really white! The material is rough and itchy. Would not buy again.
"The arch support on these is so aggressive that after wearing them around the house for about an hour my feet felt like I was standing on rocks and the entire next day my insteps were bruised feeling and I felt like I had shin splints. I don't care if these are considered ""top of the line"" or not, but if they kill your feet to the point of disability they might as well be $10 Dollar General shoes. Very stiff and supportive for backpacking but I thought them to be overkill unless you are doing serious  mountaineering. Definitely not for day hiking even if you plan to hike in rocky and hilly terrain."
"It was nice when I got it.  I used it a few times.  It does not stop the wind very well.

My biggest complaint is the color.  It is just impossible to clean.  It is dirty now and I have been unable to clean it.  I have tried a few different methods.  Maybe it is the fabric or the color."
"XL Size. 100 percent Rayon very thin material, pocket pattern to body shirt good match, woody buttons are ok.
The pattern looks ok from a distance. Delicate wash cold hang to dry ... too small.
Collar scrunched up feels weird. Overall not happy.
Definitely need a XXL."
"These run small, I had to return this."
"The rings I received are a very dark gray metal; not at all what I was anticipating.  The fit was fine and the stones were very nice, I just can't get past the color of the metal.  I am returning."
very cheap quality. not worth it
"This top does not match the photo on the page.  It is a LARGE white, long-sleeved t-shirt with a band around the bottom and slim arm holes from the wrist to about 5 inches above the wrist.  The pockets are not really pockets - I cannot fit my hands into the pockets and I definitely wouldn't want to keep something in this pocket.  I am 5'0"", 145 lbs.  I usually wear a small or medium, but this product encouraged ordering up a size.  I wouldn't.  The large is very large.  I have requested to return this item."
"I didn't like it it is very filmsy and thin not a real blazer I was really dissapointed this looks more like a shirt no lining, not what I expected."
"There run extremely wide in both the toe and heel.  I love running shoes with a wide toe box, but this shoe is too wide to provide any support.  My foot moves around and my heel lifts right out of the shoe when it's laced up."
THEY PRETTY --- THATS ALL I GAVE THEM AWAY
"These pants must not have passed someone by quality control. All stitching was frayed and crooked.
I like the style, but don't trust what these companies are selling on Amazon, especially cloathing."
"It's pretty but the back came off and wouldn't stick back on and that's just not good.  I had to return it which was no hassle.

If you just want it as a conversation piece it's perfect for that.  And if you don't mind supergluing the back so it won't be replaceable battery anymore...then it's a good value.  Unfortunately i needed a pendant watch to tell time."
Run very narrow . My daughter doesn't have a wide foot  and this shoe is too narrow on the top and the sides. The sole is also not memory foam like other Stride Rite shoes and not as soft to walk on
I'm dissatisfied because I ordered the navy color and it is not a solid color navy; it is mottled which is not what I wanted.
Destroyed by a flood before uae
"Shorts quality are what you would expect from Dickies. The metal button is nice. However, the zipper pockets are noisy and require 2 hands to unzip. Instead, recommend these, which I got in black: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000236TLY/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_c_api_zA2PxbS9R3QDH"
These have the worst chemical smell of any shoes I've ever purchased online! STAY AWAY from these. Even after washing them several times there is still a strong smell!
"Will not buy again, botton too small to set up time. It describes batteries includes on the package but it didn't."
"The colour is not teal, it's green, nice green but not teal. The material I find to be very thin and more like a light jersey material. It's an Ok dress."
"Really small squared set of sunglasses, for the exagertaed description given."
"These are gorgeous, so this breaks my heart... I MUST return them! The sizing is so ridiculous on these! The left fits perfectly... exactly like a perfect size 5, and with the right foot shoe... I cant even fit my toes in! I am a perfect size 5 and every pair of Jessica Simpson heels has fit me PERFECTLY until these!  It's as if they made a mistake a put a size 4 or 4.5 in the box by mistake. I'm very sad to send these back."
Heavy and droopy - doesn't retain any shape to it at all.  Not worth even half the price!
DIIDNT LIKE
"They're a bit wide so I had to comfort or control while working out. On top of that the bottom of the shoes is cheap material, the foam type that you get when buying shoes from Marshalls or Ross.  Those ones with no grip or traction. So its terrible when working out legs or just running. DO NOT wear in rain, you will slip. I barely made it up my driveway hill"
"Runs small, and the flap crossover on the chest area is not sewn down so it flops all over. Also it is really just a dark purple, not a berry color and it is a thin knit. It also runs long and went well over my knees."
Very cheap looking.  The quality just wasn't there.  They were a good price but you get what you pay for.
The look of the necklace is great but after wearing it for about 1 month it started to turn my neck green and I NEVER EVEN wore it is the shower.  I do not recommend purchasing this necklace if you want to have it for a long time.  Not worth the money. I would buy sterling silver instead from now on.
Too small in toe box and across foot. Bought normal size.
"The reflection is absolutely stunning, with a shallow angle of view. So someone with headlights will see you, no one else will. Fabric looks plain grey from all other angles.

I'm a 2x in std US sizes, women's 20. This does not fit my hips at all, but I can get it zipped at the waist, so theoretically I could wear this... but really I look like I'm an idiot. Definitely size up 1-2 sizes for US customers.

No room for layering and it is suffocatingly unbreathable. Inner lining is like a platic sheet and there are no vents built into this jacket. Any high humidity makes this feel unbearable.

But it is really amazingly reflective. So 2 stars it is!

Ps. Dear manufacturers, big people have money and want to be seen in the dark too. Try increasing your revenue by increasing your stock selections!!!"
Shoe did not fit as advertised. The shoe does not provide adequate arch support.
Runs large in size and retiring it is like 15 steps I don't have time for...save yourself the time and just don't buy it.
"After two months, the inside soles were dirty and started to stink badly, and they can't be washed. After three months, the soles started separating from the shoe. I can no longer wear them, and I can't return them."
"Save your money, get a different wig. I attempted to style this for Ariel and it was a Nightmare. Red hair was EVERYWHERE!"
Color is not bright. Design not flattering to body. Material cheap.
Very slippery in snow. Not very comfortable
I ordered a 34DD. I didn't like how it made my boobs look. Not only did it not push my boobs together like in the picture (separated then) it also squished my outer boob section inwards if that makes sense. It looked a lot sexier in the pictures.  It however is comfortable so if that's all you are looking for then this is your bra. I will be returning.
I returned this because I received another better one as a gift.  Mine was NOT the bleached denim color as this photo!!?...it was darker.
I believe I got the large and I couldn't even get it close to fitting on it me.
Returned them as it made my feet worse.  Trying to get rid of inflamed plantar facia. Not for everyone.
I had to return my purchase.
"I love Birkenstock shoes because of the comfort and have worn them since the 80's.  This pair had to be returned because they sent me the wrong size. I have several other Sidney style and I love them.  I wear them all day and every day of the spring, summer, and fall. When the snow flies then I have to wear something different. I also wear the Arizona, Florida, and Orlando. I own probably 16 pair and they are all 36 M (called regular width) and they sent me 36 N (narrow)."
Print not very pleasing. Too much black outline
i own sketchers and this pair did not fit at all.  too small.  need to return
"I actually loved this design. It was beautiful in person as well, but within 2 days the first blue ""stone"" next to the center fell out. Extremely disappointing. I guess you get what you pay for."
It's way too Small and not worth purchasing. i don't like this umbrella and thought it was larger in size.
"The support of these shoes is great.  However, they do squeak a little when you walk which is kinda annoying.  But my REAL issue is that the rose gold part seems to be flaking off and I've not had these shoes for two months!  Super disappointed.  Definitely will not look nice enough to wear as ""dress shoes"" soon.  Thought at the price I'd get better quality than this."
Way big.. was suppose to get a 34x32 but it's more like a 38x32. Be cautious
the crinkles are a little too much
"I expected these to be thick and warm and they sadly weren't. The material was about as think as my other leggings with a thin soft fleece lining. I'm just under 5""4' and 135lbs and they were baggy in some places and much too long for me. I am returning them."
"Sticker left residue on leg.  There's no way to remove this and it ruins the pants.  This was a Father's Day gift and Amazon won't return since it's after 30 days.  Beware when you're purchasing for holidays, Amazon won't accept returns after 30 days, no matter what the problem is."
"These shoes are not for my feet. The arch support is non-existant. Sole is too thin in the front, in my opinion. Makes my toes go to sleep. I went with Skechers for the same price and I'm in heaven. I repeat, heaven."
WAY smaller than the size chart says
The dress is beautiful but if you have breasts bigger then an A cup the material will not cover you. It's only the triangles that are supposed to cover that are to small and I did have other women with smaller breasts try it on to make sure that was the problem. Otherwise I loved everything else about it.
"I tried these on when they first arrived, over a pair of underwear I was already wearing and I thought they'd fit great.
Threw all 5 pairs in the washer and dryer and they came out a lot smaller.

I'm a big guy at 6'2"" ~ 285lbs with big thighs and these simply won't cut it after they shrunk.  :(

I guess I will just give them to my father who's quite a lot smaller.

Quality of material is very nice but they ended up too snug in the wrong places."
Didn't live up to all the reviews for me.  Wasn't very supportive and I wear a 34 D.
sloppy looking and it did not lay well on my body.
"I received the wrong side, even though the polibag says 36 32, on the pant paper tag clearly you can see it 36 30!!!!"
"The dress is too long, definitely not meant for petites"
"it started pilling in 2 wears ,we were disappointed had to return it"
"Had to return it, it was way to large specially the length, looked like a baggy maxi dress"
Fine if you are a thin 8 year old- possibly they mean for this to be a bracelet??? It seemed to be well made- but I was very disappointed that it was no not usable- even on a 24 yr. old THIN male
These boots were paper thin.  I would not purchase these at all!! I returned them.
"I ordered the pink dress in an XL/XXL  and  I am somewhat pear shaped, however, it was really really too large up top. Simply too wide underneath the arm and across my shoulders, back and bosom.  The bottom fit okay.  Too bad, I couldn't wear it because the dress is a vibrant pretty color and the material didn't feel super cheap and thin. I may get it in a size lower (L)."
"I bought 3 sets of these shoes which all slip off at the back although I chose the right size.  The platform cracks, the fabric peels off and before you know it, your shoes need to be dumped!"
Way too small. I do not recommend even trying to buy this product.
"This is a black & white striped dress made of bathing suit material. My computer monitor gave me the impression that this dress was navy blue and white. Also, it isn't well made. there was a partial white stripe where the top black stripe meets the black chest material. The defect was super obvious so I returned it. Otherwise I would have kept it as a beach dress to wear over a bathing suit. I also noticed the elbow patches weren't exactly on the elbows. Bummer : (

Final note... I am always a medium and based on other reviews I ordered a large which fit me perfectly."
This dress is so cheap looking. It ripped the first day I even tried it on. I'd be better off wearing my tablecloth.
Size was not as expected!  Very disappointed.  WWWAAAAAYYY too small!!
"Very disappointed in these sandals.  One shoe stretched is in now too big for me to wear.  Very nice looking, but not the quality I was hoping for."
I am still waiting for it to arrive. It is getting chilly outside and would be a nice addition to my fall wardrobe.
i ordered the Large one.  But  ITS FOR KIDS.  I CANT FIT AT ALL.  DISAPPOINT.  Sad and i will never ordered again from here
"Ordered this product from Ark Toys, but it is the same exact description. The description states that it is the Melissa and Doug Medical Dress up set, combined with a toy tool kit with 19 pieces. I knew that the tool kit was not made by Melissa and Doug, but I did think that it would compliment the set.

First off, the toys in the medical kit were nice, and quality toys, but it was a SIX piece set, not 19 as advertised. Even if you count the kit and every single piece of the costume set, I still only got to 15. Also, the actual case was on the cheap side, and was difficult to open and close for an adult, never mind a child.

I returned this and ordered just the Melissa and Doug costume. Would not recommend the bundle. I will find a sturdy and cool doctor's kit for my son."
Bought these for my teenaged daughter....they run very small....order a size larger than you would normally wear.
Stinky bracelet. I will be returning it.
"I love toe rings. At first i was so excited by these however I have lost 6 so far. One or two stretching out could be acceptable based on the pricing,  At first the fit is perfect but after a day of wear they have fallen off. The couple I found have allstretched out."
"Awful product. Do not buy. Does not even look like a city, just blobs. Material isn't great."
They were too big and I could already see how the leather was rubbing off of the bow.  They wouldn't have stayed cute for long.
I am done buying crocs online! These were crazy small-I ordered size 6 for my daughter and they're smaller than the ones she has now! I am so confused on croc sizing.
I loved the design! A much needed addition to the Alegria line.  I was deeply disappointed that they ran so small and that a larger size was unavailable. Very disappointed to send them back.
Nice sweater but runs very small. Returning it
"Cheaply made, the ring is so light and not as nice as the pictures. Giving it 2 stars because i will probably wear it until I find a new one."
"WAAAAAYYYYYY too short.  I am 135 5'6 and usually wear a medium, but this made me feel like a giant.  Not sure ordering a size up will help since it was wide enough just not long enough."
"I'm 6'2"" and 230 Lbs and don't think my dreams would fit in the largest size."
"This item is (USUALLY) awesome! I can't go barefoot or in non-supportive shoes because of a foot issue, so I live in these at home. I actually have 2 pair at home right now, they're just getting old and worn. I was unable to use this specific item because I was sent the wrong color item and it was obviously used."
"Even though I bought exactly by the chart, I could not it get up to my thighs! I am 5'5"", 146lb bought size 2. Very disappointed, went size bigger than usual..

the material is kind of nice, but I am not certain  I can call it SUPER OPAQUE..."
"As a woman, I tend to wear a lot of my husband's pajama pants, so I figured I would just order my own.  These were not the PJs I was looking for.  They were WAY to tight in the butt and hips and way to baggy in the crotch.  This may be a comfortable fit for men; I don't know.  I know these felt absolutely wrong on me."
"Very pretty, but does not fit around my chest. The front panels are about 6"" wide on either side of the seams. I can put it on, sleeves are long enough,shoulders fine, but it doesn't even come close to fitting around the front. It's the weirdest sweater I've ever put on. Maybe I can find a woman with no breasts, who it will fit. I suppose that's what the ""funky"" is all about. Haven't had time to send it back, for the price, I'll just donate it."
Cute but mildew smell was so strong the packaging had to be disposed of outside and the bracelet is unwearable unless I can get rid of the super strong  odor. Disappointing.
I am looking for a pair of platform sandals and these are not it. They have rivets all around the bed of the shoe and they dig into both feet! They do have a rocking motion to propel you forward as you walk. That is kind of cool but they are very uncomfortable to walk in-no cush or support. Yucky. Try something else.
Water resistant but NOT water proof. My son's feet were also cold after a short time outside. These boots would benefit from a liner inside and a water repellant spray coating.
"These shoes are no way like the old ones. They squeak when I walked in them. They never left my house on my feet. I own 5pairs of the old ones, and was so excited when I saw the blue. A beautiful blue color, u can't change out the insoles and use orthotics (Your own inserts) has memory foam, the shoe is not stable because it's too soft ....I sent it back the next day. And I love Amazon, if I buy something through Amazon, and not happy with the product, they take it back, no fuss...Love you Amazon!"
Gave away too small
"Like the look of the watch and the ""easy read"" dial.  Nice to have the Indiglo feature. Band is a serious bummer as it pinches your skin with the slightest movement... and this was just trying it on. In addition, unless you have very large wrists, you will need to pay to get it sized."
"I was pretty fooled... it looks great on the picture but NO like most of the reviews its not worth the $$ I had to cut here glue there fix here and there. the bodice is plastic cheap plastic like when you where five back in the 70's 80's costume mask material. the only great part was the fabric that hangs, even the underwear is rather small, the tiara or head piece came apart even before I took it out of the package!! Don't buy it if you do not want to fix it, if you do care to cut and paste then you like to throw money away.

I spent to much money making or rather getting it perfect!  :/"
"I used to be a big fan of Hanes' women's undergarments. The no-line panties were a staple of my lingerie drawer for years. About two years ago, I bought two new packages, and in each package, the patterned pair's waistband was a full inch larger than that of the solid-colored pair. I bought another package last year and had the same problem. I also tried a package of the cotton ones with the really wide waistband, and these nylon ones. In every package, there was a size variance between pairs. So last month I bought a package of Bali panties. All three pairs were exactly the same size, and they fit perfectly. Goodbye, Hanes."
"Cute dress but I had to return it. I normally wear M, but this dress runs large. I ordered it in M, then purchased a S one but it was still big on me. Its also a maxi dress for petit women. The colors are very pretty."
There is a seam inside the sock at the bottom of that nice little tab that keeps it from slipping down your foot and on a 5-mi walk it really started to irritate. I had an imprint from it when I got home.
It broke my watch the first time I used it. Be Carefull
china construction !
"pants fit okay, however, super thin.  ordered some other palazzo pants that i wear to work (they are just so darn comfortable and great fabric so they look just like normal dress pants) but definitely couldn't pull these off in an office.  they are yoga pants at most.  comfortable, but inside the house only kind of pants."
"These sweatpants would be GREAT if they each had a proper drawstring.  I bought two pairs for my husband for Christmas, and he was delighted to get them.  They are nice-looking and fit beautifully.  Sadly, the drawstrings proved woefully inadequate and snapped right away.  What a bad surprise!  Neither of us has ever had this problem with any of our other sweatpants.  I can't imagine what someone was thinking to use this cheap garbage in making these otherwise nice pants."
I'm totally unsatisfied. I received my dress and opened it up. Some of  the little rhinestones weremissing and also the rhinestones were just scattered and crooked. It was just a bad bad purchase. I'm not happy at all. I don't think they inspect before they ship.
My husband has worn these pants since I met him in 1991. These pants are much smaller than the pants we have purchased in the past. I'm not sure if I'll have to get one or two sizes larger in the waist. The other's started off loose and tightened up a bit as they were laundered. These are so tight I'm afraid to wash them. He can barely get them buttoned. I will need to exchange them for a larger size.
"Huge, and cheap material."
Nothing like the true garnet color looks more orange in color in fact clashes with my other garnet jewelry
The shoes look nice I can give them that. But I don't know what happened to Clarks. I tried a pair on in store and had to return them as well. These shoes make my feet hurt more than my flat vans do when I stand all day for work. I was really dissapointed and thought maybe I was tripping. But my feet where aching so much after wearing them.
"I was disappointed in the quality of these socks. After one wearing, the elasticity was poor. They were falling down around my ankles. I am accustomed to high quality products from Gold Toe, and I am dissatisfied with these. I would not recommend them."
"Was disappointed with this. I wear large for the majority of my clothing, but occasionally need an x-large. I'll remember this next time buying a Levi's non-jean product. This fit fine out of the box, but after washing and drying it once it was a couple inches shorter on my arms, so I gave it away to my younger brother who's a couple inches shorter than me. I'm just glad it wasn't expensive."
"Honestly, not what I expected. From the quality of fabric to the size, I am disappointed."
Piece of crap. Returned it. Extremely undersized. Poor quality.
Petal Print is not made the same as white and black colors. Fabric on side bands is a single layer instead of the double layers on the white and black. Therefore it stretches more and makes the bra loose. Kept riding up even on the tightest setting. Just doesn't hold like the other colors.
One had ripped. Then first wash as instructed still shrunk and ripped even more they were very poorly made
i got them  they were too  small  i  wrot  the company & they said thats all they  had
Watch lasted 2.5 years and then stopped charging.  Battery replacement cost $55. Save yourself some aggravation and get a normal battery powered one and not a solar.
the bra straps are to short was unable to unjust them for more length dddddd
"These are attractive and bright so they help you identify your luggage quickly. BUT, unfortunately one of mine tore off during my first flight. They are not able to withstand the rigors of being loaded and unloaded from a plane. I would not buy them again."
The fit in the hips and thighs was too tight. It does not flow away from the body there at all.
"Very deep ""U"" so that you show a lot of sock, or unprotected feet. They gapped on the sides as you walked. Not good for me. Send them back. Oh, and they made a deep squishy noise because of the insole liner being extra soft. Just wrong for me. For all I know, all this could be good for you in a shoe, but they were sorta short in toe room and yet too large all around."
The insole is so uncomfortable and hard compare to other Clarks Sandals. The leather is kind of rough and scratchy.
I gave these to my kid because they are pretty much just childrens plastic play glasses.
These were cumbersome to use. Waste of money!
This wasn't worth the effort if took to order it.  The costume was crammed into the packaging in a way that wrinkled the cheap fabric so bad I don't think you could ever straighten it enough to get it on a child.  The hat doesn't begin to resemble a cowboy hat.  It's going back.
"I bought the 0-12 month for my 7 month old daughter and it was super small on her. Her forearms stuck out the ends and barely went over her belly.

On a plus, it was nice thick and soft material. Wish the size would have worked out better"
"Being that this is a Superman shirt, I was expecting it to be super. Disappointment abounds! Although the fabric seems nice enough, take a look at the pic. The superman logo tilts upwards, towards the right, AND the logo is not even centered on the shirt! See how much closer to the arm seam it is on the right side? Sending this thing back. I'd expect this kind of nonsense on a Captain America shirt or perhaps a shirt based on that one time George Clooney played Batman."
I am 5'8 and 175. Bought a medium. Shoulder is fine but the waist line is way too large. It will fit perfectly if you have a belly.
Beautiful shoes but leather is very stiff and uncomfortable. Will wear for short periods of time and for looks only.
They were to big so I can't wear them.
Doesnt make any difference with or with out! Fabric isn't tight enough!! My first Spanx and very disappointed!
"This swimsuit was way too small.  I ordered my regular size in swimsuits, and I couldn't pull it up past my chest to get my arms through the straps.  I would have had to order 2 sizes larger.  I think the description should note that you should order one or two sizes up.  I ended up going to a brick and mortar store and purchased one in my reqular size.

The suit looked the same as presented on the website, but if it doesn't fit, appearance is irrelevant."
"BROKEN LATCH,"
"Very small backpack, we had to return it.  There was not much room in the large compartment.  The colors were pretty, but the materials were very thin and did not seem sturdy."
SMELL BAD!!! AND UTS PLASTIC!!! I AM ABOUT TO RETURN BECAUSE TO SMALL WVEN I DID CHOOSE BIGGER THAN MY SIZE
"Shoes would fit much better If sent in true size.  With the combination size (9-10), heel does not set and the solar is about an inch or maybe more too long. P
MISSFIT"
I did nit care for it. Looked different than picture. Kinda stiff looking.
"Really really loved this cover up until I washed it (gentle cycle, cold water). The strings on the bottom we're completely tangled and frayed after :( bummer."
"Cute in concept, but they were super tight in the calves (which is never a problem for me), and really loose around the waist.  They were also weirdly saggy in the front."
they were returned.
This looks like it should be a loose fit but it is very very tight.
"Had these boots for about two weeks and they are awful. My past pair of boots was the Valsetz and they were so comfortable. These boots on the other hand are painful to wear, I feel like I'm standing on sharp rocks. Would not recommend these boots; I am returning them."
"The picture looks pretty but in person this piece has no depth, very flat, and looks more like a paper cutout.  I'm returning it."
"Cuts into back of ankles HORRIBLY.
Don't was your money!!!"
The gold started coming off after a few days.
Thin and flimsy. Very disappointed.
"Way too small and stiff.
I ordered my true size (11 1/2) I could barely get one foot in, I didn't even try to jam my other foot in the other one. I didn't realize the sole was painted and not molded white, I'm not happy about that. That might be a deal killer when I return. I don't think I want my sneakers peeling after a few wears.
Too bad because the tri color burgundy/grey ones i got look awesome.
Id go up a full size (12 1/2) when ordering. True size was very tight."
I DON'T LIKE THAT THE SWEATPANTS ARE TOO SMALL BUT OVERALL CUTE..
"Thin, cheap-looking. I like the idea of it though. Spend more money and get something nice."
"Very cute.  However, this is not one size fits all.  They are somewhat tight.  I won't be able to wear them for very long.  If I had the change for a re-do, I would not buy them.

LG"
Tiny cheesy. Back tore off two first use.
It was all ready fairly small. Then I washed it. Now it's practically a man thong.
"The shirt fit as expected, but it was a little more transparent than I would've hoped for from a white shirt. After one washing, it didn't look so great. Lots of fuzzies."
"I ordered a size Large, which I wear comfortably.  These were super tight and I'm guessing would have shrunk when I washed them.  I also thought the straps were chintzy.  They were ribbon-like, which wasn't in itself a reason for me to return them. However, they were the length I was looking for."
"They are made well, but I should have believed the reviews before I bought them. They are  small and narrow. I did order a half a size bigger, but should have ordered one and half size bigger. After all, these are slippers. Well, two, three weeks of wearing them should make them fit better. Glad I didn't throw away my other minnetonka's. The old ones were just the right and correct size for me. Giving 3 stars because manufacturer should state the size correctly.

After a few years of wearing them as slippers at home the rubber bottom started to peel off. Downgrading it to 2 stars. Just wish they would bring back the quality they had when I got the moose skin ones. I still have and wear them after 8 years."
"I tried to put these on and quickly realized that the left leg was made smaller than the right. I got the right side on but the left would not go up past my thigh. Also, they are not as sheer as I like and appeared to look more like tights than pantyhose. I returned them and ordered a different brand."
"This bathing suit is TERRIBLE!  I'm shocked at all the good reviews.  First of all, it runs like 2 sizes small.  I am 5'5"" 140 lbs, usually a size 6, and ordered a 10 based on reviews.  It is snug.  Not only that, the cups inside are too small for my boobs (36D).  The bathing suit pushed my boobs down, making it look very unflattering.  It def doesn't fit or look anything like the model in the picture.  Sending it back!"
"Ok two gripes;
1. is supposed to be high gloss. I could not get a high gloss out of this paste, at best I'd call it low sheen.
2. The stuff really smells awful! I mean its so strong that after I polished my shoes and buffed it off people complained about the fumes at work (I applied the polish at home). And at the end of the day when I put the shoes away at night my wife complained that the closet stunk like chemicals. A week after I applied this stuff and they still stink.

I have tried other colors and pastes from Saphir with no problems but this stuff is terrible. Next stop, the trash can."
I order 4 extra-large  and I got 3  extra large  these t shirt runs very small
Poor stitching!
runs very small. weird armpit seams.
Worn less then 10 times and it's starting to fall apart.
"As pictured, the bottom of this shirt should rest at the hips. I'm not that tall and it barely touches my waist."
"holes after very few washes, felt like I sweated more in them"
Was supposed to be assorted colors  They were all grey other then that  good
I have been airing this bag out in my garage for 13 days. Why is it in the garage? Because it stunk my whole house up! It smells of some chemical. I didn't even think that it was leather so I contacted the seller. I was told to let it air out and take it somewhere to verify that it was leather. I took it to a quality leather goods store in the area and they advised that it was in fact leather but they were confused as to what caused the leather to smell like a chemical. I decided to keep the bag because it is leather and the bag doesn't smell as bad as it did when it arrived. I still wouldn't use it on vacation and it can't come in the house yet.
A fickle pit
"Bottom cushioning is good, and extra padding at the heel keeps the shoe from slipping, but the toe box is painfully small. I normally wear a 10 N, went up a half size, then ordered medium. They are all so small in the toe I couldn't stand it. I've wasted enough money on Asics and am back to New Balance."
This bra was just scratchy and uncomfortable to wear and I do feel the 36 was not a true 36. I just didn't like the fit.
"Wish I could be more positive, but looks really cheap, which it was.  But had hoped for more.  Sorry."
THIS SANDAL FITS A BIT NARROW BUT EVEN WORST IT HAS A BALL OR KNOT OF RUBBER THAT POKES AND HURTS MY ARCH.
I have had this for only 3 months and the lining for the compartments is already coming apart.
"At first, hubby loved them.  One year of hardly any wear, the zippers started giving him problems.  They are now a piece of junk after normal wear for two winters (to and from work in the vehicle, but no hard work in them) because the snaps and zippers are falling apart.  I wish these were better quality because then we would be repeat customers.  Looking for a new brand now.  This has sullied the name of the Dickies brand for us.

Then we found out that Dickies would replace them!  This made us so happy... at first.  But after spending two whole months of dealing with Dickies customer service, they ""lost"" the record of our first two phone calls with them despite the girl remembering my DH, kept saying changing what they would offer to replace the overalls with, and finally (4th call) ended up offering to replace them with an inferior Walls brand (the zippers on the legs do not come up past the knee).  Hubby asked if they would at least throw in a free cap or shirt, and they are sending two cheap knit tomboggans with the Dickies logo.  Sorry, but we won't be advertising such bad service!!!  NO MORE DICKIES purchases for us!!!

Previous review when they were new..."" My husband loves these.  He formerly owned a pair of the regular insulated bib overalls by Dickies.  The difference in these are that the leg zippers begin higher at the hip so that he can zip down to reach into his jeans pockets.  He says they feel wonderful.  For some reason he could not snap the ankle snaps on his older pair but can on these while wearing his work boots.  He is 5'11 and got a short, and they fit almost perfectly in length."""
It can't be worn as pants and is short for on my 5'7 frame.
"too heavy for my ear, makes it bleed. and i believe i'm allergic to it, Not for sensitive ears!! however, looks really amazing!! just bigger and heavier than i thought! and my ears get a rash!"
"The product that I received was not the same product pictured.. The plaid was red and navy blue, not black. And it seemed to be made out of very cheap, thin material with a noticeable seam running right down the middle in the front."
Product is not as fitting as the competitor brand.without realizing this is a different brand all together
Hard plastic part on the straps sticks into your foot making them unwearable- I wish I had listened to a review here that said that! Also the pink cloth part is too hard and inflexible. You can wear them with socks maybe but it defeats the purpose of sandals- I often do wear my sandals with socks but I want the option of wearing them with bare foot or nudie socks which offer little protection against uncomfortable shoes. Even with socks they don't feel all that comfortable. I recently bought a pair of fitflop slide sandals at Marshalls which are so comfortable. These don't feel as comfy / soft in the soles so I'm wondering if these are fake fitflops?  Too bad because otherwise these are cute and I love the hot pink.
"they came on time and in a nice clean package and they do look sturdy when you first open them since they are double hemmed through out. But they do not have any elasticity. I put them on and they stretched to fit my legs. ( I have normal average legs) but they started to fall and I could not keep them up for anything. I was thinking they might work really well with a garter belt since there is no sticky cling on the inside of them. After having them on for about 30 minutes I got tired of fighting to keep them on and I took them off. They didn't go back to the shape they came in. They just stayed in an outline of my leg and foot. So I guess they are good for one quick wear, but I was planning on taking my kid trick or treating and this was going to be part of my costume."
"I was very disappointed in the shoes, however, once again, AMAZON was very supportive in how to return an item
that did not fit.  I have high arches, and this particular shoe cut into my foot."
"These are not large in the waist, but they extremely, extremely long.  They fell at least 2 inches below my son's knees, maybe more.  There is no indication, that I can see, for an inseam.  Other than that, I would've really liked these."
I should have read the reviews prior. It looks nice from the outside but it sucks that it doesn't close.
"Very lightweight, cheap feeling and cheap looking to me. Returned it."
The picture online makes it look like both sides of the cardigan extend down below waist level. I had no idea that this cardigan features an asymmetrical flourish - one side is completely straight across while the other side is longer and dips down below the waist. It looks strange and I would never have ordered if it the picture had accurately shown the asymmetrical hem.
The bottoms were not what I expected. The bottoms did not seem like shorts at all. I would have loved this product if in fact the bottom were shorts because I would get more coverage.
Very cheap and extremely small Im 120 lbs and orders large and its so small
"I purchased this shoe goo to temporarily repair a small tear to the side of my rubber rainboots. It was messy to work with and when I wore the shoes 48 hours after I had applied the shoe goo, the goo almost immediately gave in, and the tear was open again, the only difference was that there was a glob of clear, dried up shoe goo on one side of the tear."
"Can hardly pull them up and can't button them, even though they are supposedly the same size as my other pants."
"The dress looks nothing like the photo. The top fits similarly but there isn't any draping as shown in the photograph. The material is thick and comfortable so I will use for around the house, but definitely not in public. I'm 5'4"" and 125 lbs and this dress makes me have the shape of an Oompa Loompa."
"Pretty shoe but too narrow and I missed my return window to get a wider size. :-(  Would love to exchange them for a wider size, but now I'm stuck and definitely will not try these again since they're too tight."
"The buckle broke the second time my daughter wore them.  Although she loves the look, they are cheaply made."
transpareb=nt.. had to return :(
"horrible.  this is so narrow that I cannot fit it over my 36D chest.  It barely covers my bottom, so there's no way it could be a dress on me and I'm only 5'5.  I normally wear a size 10 at the most and the size large was incredibly small.  Fit like a size 4-6."
"too small. I done it too a friend, who really need a jacket"
"I like the color but not the dress. I bought a medium for my weight of 148, it fits well but the style is far from what I expected it to be. The skirt part at the front is way too short for the style and I don't like the material for that style of dress."
"Probably send back. Have weird piece on top, definitely run small"
"Be careful if you decide to buy this dress, I bought it XL size as usually, it is too small and short I'm 5,4"" and the dress fix under my need."
"Very thin, cheap"
"I've had my eye on these shoes for over a year, but didn't want to splurge on such an expensive pair of shoes.  I finally treated myself and what I get in the mail are basically extremely overpriced ballet flats.  I could have bought this same exact thing at payless for 10 dollars.  None of the pictures or descriptions showed the actual material these were made out of.  I doubt these will even last a few months.  Then to top it off when I finally resigned myself to the fact that I was ripped off, while wearing them there is a piece in the back of the left shoe that painfully pokes into the back of my ankle.  I am so disappointed.  I will never buy from this company again."
Im 5'2 122bs this dress stop at my butt cheeks I was so disappointed I was expecting it to be short but not that short. If your looking for something really SHORT this is dress for you. The dress is gorgeous but its too short for me.
looks great but do not keep the time
"I am really disappointed with these.  I wore Mizuno Wave Alchemy shoes for the past 9 years and these just suck.  The 11s were not great either, but I have the 4s up through these and they have been getting progressively worse.  I used to use these as a short lean runner with stubby wide flat feet.  Now, they seem to be geared to fat men with crap feet.  They are so heavy, bulky, and cumbersome I don't get how you can call them a control shoe if you're constantly fighting with them.  I'll go home and use some of my several-years-old pairs that have become lawn-mowing shoes for running and even though they're worn out, they're still better than these."
This piece of clothing would be much better with smaller arm holes.
This was definitely a bad buy. The cowgirl hat they sent me was not in any form close to being a cowgirl hat!  looks like a fishing hat. This was a waste of money!
They are plenty dark. Problem is that the nut fell off right after I opened the package. I still cant find the plastic washer. If you have somelock tight on hand then definitely get them. Otherwise make it a bundle purchase.
Ordered as a wide width shoe.  Absolutely not wide width.
"These are good for someone on a budget but I recommend going for AvidLove thongs. These things come from China (not a fan of supporting overseas), they don't last long, the first set I bought lasted maybe 6 months before started getting holes on the sides. The AvidLove thongs are great, zero fabric on the sides, I don't need to use curb corn starch or anything while wearing the AvidLove like I needed to with these and the product is roughly $20 more expensive (well worth the price). By the way, I have about a 38 waist, so I ordered size large (goes up to 39 waste), with the AvidLove and they fit beautifully."
I don't like it. I'm actually sending it back. We bought them in 3 different colors and they are all going back. They don't jingle as loud as you would think because the coins are sitting so far apart from each other.  I'm actually learning more about hip scarves as I research them. But these are not as loud as they could be. My daughter and I take a Zumba class and I can barely hear them.
"I bought this pair of shoes in April of 2014 and had holes in the light material near the toes by August.  I wear them for both hiking and casually, but was disappointed how quickly the material wore out.  The sole has held up fine, but the lighter material is very thin and rubbed enough to where I have 2 holes in each of my shoes near the toes.  I would expect a shoe to hold up a lot longer than this."
"Very baggy in the waist, poorly finished seams, cheap fabric."
The one size fits most is for someone who is a small or medium. Very nice material tho. Had to return it.
way smaller than i expected.. i bought a XL for my sister but it was even too small for me (im 5' 5'' and 135 pounds) unless your tiny its not worth the money.. the materiel was nice.. but way to small... maybe good for teenagers who are small..
It works but not very well. I ended up ordering shoe stretcher  because this product barely worked
I was very disappointed the style is very cute but the sizes are nothing like what they're supposed to be. I ordered the shoes to get them right away for my daughter's recital And the size wasn't even correct..I was very unhappy Now I'm stuck with these shoes
Did not fit my foot well.  Hard shoe and not very comfortable.  Had to return it to keep from wasting money.
"The material is very cheap. Although, I guess I should have expected that for $10. Also, it took forever to receive."
"Use a garbage bag and a vaccum cleaner, works better for cheaper."
bought a 2x and its was still too small  nice jumpsuit just wish it fit
After a few hours of use the insole was coming apart. Needs like extra glue or better.
"They are way too wide in the calves, and the 2nd zipper looks really awful. They are also much too high, as they come up to my knees (I am 5'4). I'm not a fan of the knee high boots, so I rolled the tops down 2 inches into the boot, and sewed them in place with a leather needle & thread. Now the height is several inches below my knee and looks classier. I would have returned them, but Aerosoles is one of the few brands that fit me well for boots, as they heel height is perfect and the foot bed accommodates my wide feet. They are comfy but have plastic noisy heels, so I will have to take to the shoe repair guy for rubber heels. There goes another $15! I am 7.5 or 8; went with 8 and they fit well with a thin insert and crew socks. These are the only disappointing Aerosoles boots I've ever ordered!"
"Lasted less than one year and the dividers started breaking, causing credit cards to fall out when opened."
When they say runs small they really mean it!
"I loved the skirt the minute I saw it and I just had to order me one. So, when I finally got it, i was very ddisappointed. This skirt looks like a skeleton skirt! Not zebra. Not flattering at all."
"I haven't worn them, I don't like the color.
I'd like to send them back.
I need a return invoice.
Please help.
best.
Terry"
Way too small and even though Im only 53 the dress way too short.
"I really wanted to love this dress I did. I purchased this dress for a funeral. After reading all the reviews decided to go for it. Only problem I had was my breast 40D at the moment didn't fit at all. This might be my fault as I just had twins a month ago but thought if I ordered the XXL it could work. Boy was I wrong, I'll have to give it a while before I try again with this dress, maybe for a better occasion."
"It would be perfect if it was a real woman's 2XL. It's more of like a junior's, if not a China 2XL (which is closer to a US M). The bust is smaller than what it should be, but the rest of it is a really good size. If you are over a 40C bra size then the 2XL will not fit."
"The band fit alright, but the cups were way too huge for 34DD, running up to my armpits. The also were weirdly loose, providing no shape/support.
I returned it."
"They're extremely tight in the crotch/top-high area.  I couldn't bear to wear them all day at work.  I am 5'9"" and weigh 130 lbs. and they were a size B."
"Good shoe for money.
13 March 2016 Revision:  Good first impression; now they are coming apart inside the sole ever so slightly that they make a groaning sound that sounds like the floor beneath you is weakening (somewhat like a balsa flooring was slightly giving way beneath your feet), but because the sound follows you wherever you go you know it is the shoe.  So these are good if you want the novelty of a groaning shoe.  Perhaps I can get into the world record book for longest walk with a groaning shoe."
"wore this 3-4 times,washed it twice in luke warm water at delicate setting..I have cut other threads  water,thought it was a fluke, but noooo.. another thread is unraveling...look at pic..c'mon Huk..and I bought a number of Huk products..the stuff is not cheap..made in Guatemala?...ah-ha..make it cheap-sell it high..and don't ask me to send it back..it's a pain in the arse..just do it right the first time..annoyed.."
"I got this for Halloween this year BUT, item DOES NOT inflate at alla. Should had read the reviews before buying. Waste of money."
too small fit
"I really like the idea of an elevated flat, and there aren't many out there.  I first purchased the Stevie by Dansko and they felt like slippers, but with my very thin legs, they looked clunky.  The Season seemed to have the same foot bed, so I ordered them. They are also very comfortable but not designed for a narrow foot.  I had the top as tight as it would go, and it fit, but this did not allow for the leather inevitably stretching with wear.  I had to anticipate that in the near future, they would feel loose.  The back strap was the real problem.  It is made to look like a buckle, but it is actually velcro.  When I tighten it as much as my narrow foot requires, there is not enough velcro-on-velcro to hold it together and the strap kept coming undone.  Could I add more velcro?  Probably- but, for the price, I don't want to have to do that."
They are very pretty but the screw backs are so small it was very difficult to get them in my kids ears and now I am a little worried they will be able to fit in their ear hole and cause problems. Don't seem appropriate to fit in kids ears as they are labeled for.
"Ariat makes great stuff. Ask any equestrian, particularly English riders, and theyll tell you they make a good, if expensive, boot.

These are (mostly) no exception... Quality, supple leather. Great style and details. Robust construction. Really a near perfect boot.

Except for one huge thing: the sizing. I need the pair of boots by the day of this review so im not going to keep guessing on the sizing and return these for a different size.

I really feel like the dimensions were put together by drunk cobblers. Seriously. Its terrible.

I'm a size 10.5-11. These in size 10wide were horrendously too big. Like amusingly so. So I tried again and re-ordered in 9.5m. They manage to be both slightly too large, and slightly too small in several places. And not quite in the normal just need to be worn in spots. I have owned all manner of boots. I have purchased riding boots from Ariat for many friends. I have never seen anything like the sizing of this boot.

So as others have suggested, order one full size smaller. And the only thing i can think, is that because of the smaller size, you may need to get it wide too. I really cant tell how easily mine are going to break in. Its loose in the heal (more than normal) but tight in the ball and top. And the calves are some of the largest and loosest ive ever seen on a boot. (normal for more suede type tops but this is crazy large, imo.) They manage to be a little too tight to put on too. Maybe this is on purpose because the floppy calf won't keep it on?

I'm going to oil and maybe even warm these up later to try to get a good fit. I've had them for 6 hours so far... Either way, for these prices, they really ought to have the sizing figured out. This is absurd. While im a huge fan of Amazon, this is one item you're better off buying at a boot shop so you can get the size figured out.

And the reason these get 1 from me is because ultimately, not matter how great a boot, if your boot doesnt fit right, and in this case im defining that as within the universally agreed upon standards in the US since Ariat is a US company, its a terribly boot for the consumer."
"Well, I waited a couple of weeks in order to give a more accurate review.  Let me first say that I have always been a big fan of New Balance shoes.  Is just about the only brand along with the Asics that I prefer.  Having said this, I have to rethink about New Balance and what is happening with their shoes.  I have been extremely disappointed with the last two pairs (not even the same style) that I have purchased.  I have always spoke highly and recommended New Balance shoes.  After this pair I will not be so quick to make this recommendation. The shoe runs wide (I did not purchase the wide variety either), has not heel support although it claims to do so.  I have a more narrow foot and I run 3.5 miles 4 to 5 times per week.  This shoe although it claims its for running has absolutely no foot support.  It runs wide and that in itself is another problem for me when running, I like a snug supportive fit.  If I would have kept the box I would have requested a return on it.  But thinking that it would be like my other NB shoes, I pitched the box before making sure they fit correctly.  This shoe was definitely not for me.  I hope that my review helps some other runner make a better choice. I am disappointed to say the least in NB and this shoe."
It fits weirdly.  The neckhole is too big.  It's too small around the middle.
Tight and ill fitting around the knees.  Needs to be stretchy at the knees.  This will hamper walking.
"I loved my Pebble watch for its notifications.  Which is why I bought it.  But, when I updated my iPhone 6 Plus to I0S 9 and received an upgrade from Pebble, I was not able to use the watch anymore.  All I got on the screen was a picture of a phone and the watch telling me to sync the watch with the phone,  We did this several times but, although it worked for a few hours, the face of the watch always went back to ""sync the watch to the phone"" message.  Eventually, the watch only showed this message when it was plugged it to charge.  Needless to say,  I was very frustrated and disappointed.  I only was able to use the watch for a short period of time and it is too late to return it now.  What a waste of money!"
"100% Cotton?  Doesn't feel like it.  Reminds me of those gritty brown towels in highway restrooms.  FOTL isn't the only one dialing back on the cotton it seems, my latest Jockeys suck too!"
Sizes are completely off compared to in stores
Ive only worn once. It looks like pajamas and the pocket is obscenely huge. Its too big to be just regular loose fit. Not flattering.
Very thin fabric.  Doesn't fit as well as other Hanes undies.
Not what I expected. Definitely returning this item. The material is not of the best quality and it runs big.
This is an okay necklace for the cost.  But the stones are so cheap that they look white.  I will be returning it.  I'd rather save up for a year for a necklace with better quality diamonds.  The chain and horeshoe itself are nice.
I'm a small and this dress runs big on the top portion
This dress was way too small on the top and crooked
"I thought these looked good at first, or at least, on Amazon's website that is - prior to having purchased them. However, when they arrived, I had a much different opinion of them. They were so skinny - starting from the mid-sole to the end of the toe box, that they could've easily been mistaken for cowboy boots. If that's the fashion that you're looking for, then you'll probably like them; that is, if you can bear having to stand in them for 10 minutes or so, or if you are able to walk down a city block without stumbling or looking like you're inebriated as hell. I most certainly couldn't so I returned them. Sadly, I have purchased dozens of shoes from Amazon and these are the very first ones that I've ever returned."
Just looked weird on me
"I kid you not, one leg was longer than the other. They are amazingly soft and feel great though."
too short and narrow for American larger feet.
Not the colors that were shown.  Got a completely different set of colors.
I was expecting a color wine scrub but the one I received was rather purple. I am not very pleased by the color
"Wayyy too small. Size chart is way off. The back also isn't as open as it is in the picture, the black part starts about halfway up your back, not at the small of your back. It's made of a cheap, stretchy, very unflattering material, and it came full of snags already. I returned the next day. Don't waste your time or money on this dress!"
Arrived with slight discolouration and a strong metallic smell. The stone looks like something from a child's toy. Haven't worn them yet but they look like they'll break after a few uses. Not recommended
the skirt looks like it was made for a 12 year old little girl
"I bought this luggage based on good reviews for a 3-week trip to Europe. Unfortunately, on the second day the zipper pull broke and made this pretty impossible to open. I then had to spend the next 3 weeks struggling to open the suitcase.

I contacted Amazon and was told the return period was over, however they were willing to send a return label and refund my money. This is actually what I would expect so I am happy to report it as my experience. My one complaint, though, is that I don't have a box large enough for the return and Amazon wasn't able to help with this. Moral is not to order luggage or large items off Amazon, or have a large enough space to hang on to boxes (which I don't in my Chicago apt)."
Fit much smaller than expected - had to return the dress.
The top is big and the bottom is small. Bottom barely covers my but crack. Brazilian bikini
"This is really really really really small, and it's an extra-large.  I wear a size 7 and 34b size so I'm not huge, but the extra large is too small for me and my tiny boobs.  It's more of a nightshirt, not a dress."
"These shoes looked very cute, and at first I thought they were comfortable, until I'd worn them for a couple of hours.  I walked less than two blocks in them and my feet literally had four holes rubbed in them, one on each foot where the strap goes over the top of the foot, and one on each foot up by my big toe.  I felt the shoes and couldn't find any rough spots or anything, and the shoes seemed to fit me properly, so I can only guess that it's because the stuff they are made out of is quite rigid, unlike normal Crocs.  I have a friend who bought the same shoes (because she thought mine were so cute) and hers didn't seem to do the same thing to her, so I'm not sure what happened with mine.  It makes me sad, because they are so cute and I'd really planned on wearing them a lot this summer, but every time I look at the scars on my feet it reminds me why I should never wear them again!"
"Dickies used to be consistent and quality. Now I have notice the sizes are all over the place. I normally have dickies size 33 x 30 which are now way too small so I order 34 x 30 and these are way too large in the waist and the length? Basically it is roulette with sizing, guess a number and hope it fits!"
"It's cheap, you get what you pay for in this case"
nice belt but too small...returned it but upon checking...there is no record of it arriving....used the UPS label provided
Product arrived with two very noticeable holes in the side.  Returned it.
I ordered a size 9. I usually wear a size 10. These sandals are way too big for my feet! I have at least another 2 inches in them. Pretty disappointed.
I used it a couple times for 2-3 days and the thong already started to stretch and fall apart. My feet are average and I barely wore them. It's almost completely flat now after less than a month
To narrow hurt feet at strap and baby toes
Had to return as they were kinked before I received them
Too fragile. Split between thumb and forefingers first wear. Fit is small.
Graphic is nice but very cheap feel to it.  Styrofoam covered with a printed sheet.  Dings easily and definitely not durable for the price.
Not worth the price. No adjustments on the back
"These look cumfy but they were not, also too narrow, if you have a wide foot these won't work for you"
These are a little thin. And leave behind TONS of colored lint. I don't wear them as a result
I own a few Columbia jackets so I was disappointed when I purchased this jacket for a vacation to New Zealand to find out on the flight over that there was a 2 inch hole in the seam near the right hand pocket. It looks like the person stitching the jacket hadn't joined the two edges together when they stitched them together and left a gap. What surprises me the most is that it got through quality control without anyone noticing the hole.
"This is my first pair of Cole Haan shoes and probably the last. The shoes look great and feel moderately comfortable. My issue is that they are very slippery on wet floors. I've never experienced such poor traction with other shoes. My first mishap was when I came inside our office building from the rainy outdoors and the soles of my shoes were wet. I slipped in a stairwell and took a bad fall. Since then I have been very careful not to wear these shoes in wet conditions. However, I recently wore them in our office cafeteria, walked over a small spill, and took a bad fall.

I'm surprised that Cole Haan doesn't account for this in the material they use."
I thought I like it but it was broken soon as I took it out the pack
returned - design too loud and bright for me.
"when i purchased the item, i was happy with the soled feet, hopeing that it would help in motivating baby to crawl. As soon as we put the sleeper on for the first time the zipper broke, We even purchased a 12 month sleeper since she is talk for her age. Very disappointed in this product."
No cotton liner
"With the socks made in China, the sizes are not clear, so I got the wrong size. would not buy again."
Cute design but a little girl sat on my dress at Disney and it broke at the zipper line couldn't be fixed and I had to be safety pinned back together. Cheaply made
"awful quality,  garbage DO NOT BUY"
Too bulky. I'm going to return them.
"the boots came scratched up on the toe, had to return.  They were cute looking, but the quality was questionable."
It's to narrow
Cute but little color
"Didn't fit, been wearing the same size bra for nearly 15 yrs and this is why i don't like to purchase online, way to small"
I purchased this for a European trip.  I wore it several times.  It proved to be hot to wear and not very functional.  I went back to using my wallet.
I ordered a small size because I am normally a size 4 but the bolero fit too tight on the sleeve. It looks like an XS. The bolero ruffle on the front and back did not work out for my outfit. Lace material is strechy.
"WAY TO BIG!! I won't even be able to wear them. Seem comfortable, but waste of money. Im done ordering on amazon from now on."
"I loved these shoes when I wore them for a few times. But then the sole started to fall apart. Also, the sole gets very soggy during rainy weather. I am not happy with them at all."
"29 inch spinner has a seam that is seperated about 2 inches at the top. Very poor quality control. Then you have to use American Tourister for warranty repairs. The suitcase has not been used and of course cannot be in this condition. Be smart, buy something else!"
The print is absolute garbage definitely an iron on. I ordered a size XL shirt it says XL but I'm lucky if it's a medium oh and it shipped all the way from China!
The shoes fit perfectly but the front top part keeps rubbing at my legs.  definitely returning it.
"could not even fit my foot into one shoe! i am usually a 6 1/2 to 7, i orderd a 7 1/2... Zipper was diffcult to zip down.. never even took other shoe out of box.. return for refund."
"Way too small, fabric is thin."
"I bought this dress for my friend. She was not happy with it. This dress is weird and not worth the money. The size does not fit as normal, it was much too small. The fabric is stiff and cheap like a Halloween costume. She was very disappointed and I had to return it."
AGAIN ANYTHING COMING FROM CHINA......DO NOT ORDER...TOO SMALL ALWAYS EVEN IF YOU ORDER XXLARGE
The sole of the slipper was so hard.  I need slippers with cushion.  I had the slippers on for 30 minutes and had to take them off.  My feet ached for the rest of the day .  I gave them away.  Very disappointed for the price I paid.
"The product looks and fits OK, but the fabric is very stiff, and didn't relax even after several washes. Donated to Goodwill."
I use it just one time and after is broked. I use it to clean the powder. I am very dissapointed and i hope to receive an discount...
"They don't look quality so I am returning them.  I would say they would be okay if darker,  but otherwise look like they came from a Walmart bin"
"did not stay up at all!  horrible, the adhesive was pilling off as i was wearing it.  so aggravated!"
This item is cheap and flimsy compared to my other shemaghs from a reputable source. The weave is loose and the colors are not vivid. Item returned for full refund.
This is dress came with the seam messed up and the zipper does not go up at all.
"The scarf arrived defective, has holes and scratches on the fabric. It's very upsetting considering extra long delivery time (around a month)."
"I ordered a size 17, I have a muscular build, sleeves are long and arms are tight in the forearm area"
Cup too large not worth paying the price to try another size
Had to return them because they were not blue as described but a purple lens.
"True to size, but the fabric quality is subpar, and makes for a clumsy fit around the waist and bust area. The color is pretty, though. I returned it today."
i am disappointed...this is garbage
"I purchased these tanks in a medium, specifying that being a 38-40"" chest,  and they fit accordingly.  I wear these as undershirts with knit polo and dress shirts. For this use, the fit of these undershirts would be perfect when worn as such. However, there is a problem with them that resulted in a 2 star rating and a refund request.  This issue has to do with the seam at the top of the shoulder.  It is poorly constructed and finished as I will attempt to capture in the photos.  Now I am no seamstress but I am competent with a sewing machine, and to me it appears that the seams in question are some kind of serger chain seam with looper threads that are not at all finished leaving those pieces sticking out.  This combined with the fact that the seam too tight leaving it puckered, you have an uneven seam that would be obvious under any shirt that lays flat over your shoulders appearing like little bumps just to the sides of your collarbones.  Perhaps I am being overly critical, but I expect an undershirt to be inconspicuous and these shirts certainly did not meet that criteria.  I compared these to some older tagless Hanes tanks i wear regularly and it just appears the quality control isn't as good as it once was."
"REALLY PRETTY, BUT MADE CHEAP"
"This is a terrible wallet. It's the thinnest leather I've ever seen a wallet made of. Seems like the maker is definitely trying to make this product as cheaply and with as little material as possible. As far as the blocking aspect Kama I am skeptical that a wallet so thin and so flimsy could protect anybody's cards from anything! I bought this wallet for my son for Christmas, and I'm sending it back. I didn't even bother giving it to him."
"My mother bought these and can't handle them for long because in spite of buying her normal width and size, they run a little narrow and pinch."
Very thin material. I don't care for the fit on me.
"you get what you pay for
pockets suck, not deep at all"
"cheaply made, clasp broke within a day"
"Advertised as 98% cotton, it is 98% polyester!"
Stretch is amazing but the fabric is a bit too scratchy and sees through for my taste.
Did not look good when I wore them. Not elegant looking rather bulky overall look. Felt comfortable though so leaving 2 stars for that.
False advertising.... Not the same shoes in the picture
"These shoes run large, and are not as comfortable as described. I wouldn't dare wear these for work. They are large/loose in height and length, but still narrow in the front just behind the toe box. I've bought much better, much more comfortable footwear for less money than these shoes cost.

I like the color and texture of the material, but don't know how they will look & feel after washing. They look OK, but they feel cheap on my feet, and I won't buy another pair. I wish I had returned them, but thought that if I bought better insoles they would be comfortable, but they really aren't, and I have to wear extra thick socks with these although I still need to stretch them behind the toe boxes. I regret that I threw out the box and cannot return them. They are a waste of my money."
Didn't hold up for very long. I will be looking for an alternative soon.
These must have been sitting in the warehouse awhile because they were extremely old. Every one of these ripped as I was putting them on my daughter. Huge waste of money.
"Arrived on time but these are microfiber, not cotton as advertised.  Pregnancy hormone changes can increase the likelihood of UTIs & yeast infections & 80% or more cotton panties helps reduce the risk.  Since these infections can cause problems in the pregnancy-especially for at risk pregnancies-truth in advertising is especially imperative for maternity items like these panties! The size chart is accurate though-XXL US L matches my daughter-in-law's size L panties.  If only they were cotton as advertised, she thinks they would be terrific."
"I do not like the product though apparently looks good quality and well with the presentation of it, but I like the lyrics because no passport are not well made"
"It was a rough year for finding slippers that I like in the store and I tried a different brand of slippers online from Amazon that I knew wouldn't work the minute I tried them on as the sole was extremely narrow so I returned them and ordered these right away.  These Colorado Chenille slippers were so cushiony and comfy when I first got them but then the cushion started to breakdown.  The inner heel has totally broken down in less than a month. I am disappointed as I was excited about them when I first got them and had to change my review. They should make these ""Colorado Clothing"" slippers in the US and use a better quality cushion so they last! I'm back to wearing my old Isotoners from over 3 years ago again and will be looking for slippers once again. Ugh!  Good news is that I bought the CC slippers from Amazon with Prime and will not have to pay to return them and will receive a refund once they receive the slippers."
Shrank a lot! Would not buy again.
"Had to return these shoes, as they were way too small (runs at least 1 size smaller) and very stiff, like you're wearing wooden clogs."
"I purchased these shoes to wear to thru-hike the Long Trail in Vermont, I specifically picked them out because they're light and claim to be waterproof.
The second day on the trail water seeped right through and my shoes got soaked from normal wet trail wear. They were in no way water resistant. And the rubber on the front started separating from the cloth on both shoes after a week.
I used to have a pair of keens that lasted me over 1000 miles before anything like this happened. I wish I would have just stuck with the keens."
"Way too much fabric and way too large.
Do your self a favor and resist the urge to order your normal size."
"Skimpy, and made for a small body."
"Do not recommend this dress. It is SO sheer and does not fit. I have a very slight build (5' 9"" 115 lbs.) and was not happy with the fit of the dress. Moreover, there was extra fabric on one of the top pieces so when I wrapped it the fabric just hung there like an extra appendage. I was so happy when I found this dress online and got for a wedding. However, the colors weren't as vibrant as pictured and it was just a disappointment"
Too large and bad quality
Too bad!!!
I love my OTBT springfields and thought these would be the same fit. Unfortunately they were uncomfortable in the front part of the shoe and I didn't think they would stretch there. The galaxy is a lovely purple though and I wish I could have kept them.
"I do not have large calves, these are way too tight.  Too bad cause I like them, but I gave them away to a really thin person.  Kind of upset as I got them to deal with El Nino here in California.  Guess I will just just get some Wellies at a garden store that I can try on - but having had those before I know they will fit even if they are ugly."
Garbage. These are a waste of time and money. I would not bother as this product is cheap and looks like it as well. Not happy and won't be purchasing again.
Laundered these before use and what a mess. They came out of dryer waded and pleated. Had to iron every single one of them and the wrinkles still didn't come out. They aren't fit even to use as rags. I've bought better from Walmart. Do NOT recommend these at all!!!!!
They shrink significantly after washing which is why the comment above.  And really no leg to speak of...disappointed;(
I will be throwing these away when I get home today. I wore them and I lint rolled 4 times during the day. They collect every fuzz you could possibly imagine! Terrible.
"I did a lot of searching and sifting through reviews before buying these sandals. I must have gone wrong somewhere. I wear an 11.5 and have somewhat wide feet. (Usually a wide shoe is too large , but most women's sandals seem to be really narrow so I was hoping for a happy medium here) Most of the reviews say that these seem to run a size bigger, but I think they are sized accordingly. I ordered an 11 thinking they would be perfect , but I should have probably gone up a size to be safer.

The width was the most disappointing part. I didn't have any trouble with the strap closest to the ankle , but when I tried to adjust the strap over my toes, I could barely make it! I managed to get the strap velcroed, but it was extremely tight and extremely uncomfortable!

These probably fit well for others, but for someone who's in between sizes and widths, this isn't your sandal, move along. :(  I'll be sending them back."
I ordered a wide in this shoe and it wasn't wide enough. Also the cut and stiffness of the material caused it to dig into the top of my toes nearest my instep. My feet hurt for days after wearing them.
Not sure this will make it through one wash cycle. Poorly made and extremely extremely small. I bought the medium for my size 2 daughter and NOTHING is covered on the bottom piece. Barely covers her bum or front. She hated it.
I had ordered a midnight blue and what I had received was clearly purple!! I was rather disappointed.
scrubs are not khaki they should be listed as chocolate or brown. not pleased
"These are my second pair - the first pair had the floral inside, the new order did not.  The very first day I wore them I looked down and at the toe of the right shoe the leather-like material had torn.  So they didn't last very long."
"Great looking sneaker, but even in a wide it's extremely narrow.  I could barely squeeze my 20 month old son's foot into it.  I would not recommend this sneaker to toddlers/kids with wide feet.  Might be ok for kids with narrow feet though."
Very disappointed.  Cheap looking and made
"Smaller narrower cut than other Kamik's I ordered 1/2 size up because I have wide feet. Still way too tight,  I own another style of Kamik which I have room for heavy socks if I choose to wear, had to return these. Also not good looking in person, but would have kept if they fit."
"This shirt was too big.  It is more of a jacket than a shirt, but it is even too big to be used as a jacket.  I had to return it."
I returned it because it was so not a 2x. It seemed to be made pretty well but I never even washed it so I cannot speak to that. It would definitely fit someone according to the sizing chart but it is not a 2x. The sizing chart says a 2x person has a 33-35 in waist. Get real!
gave it to landscaper-he like it I didn't
Soles started to fall apart after a few months. Pretty disappointed as I've liked New Balance in the past
DO NOT PURCHASE!! Very poor quality and pants weren't even hemmed!
These were even tighter in the calves than the Levi's skinny fit jeans that I previously bought. They also shrunk after washing in cold gentle cycle.
Fitting is ok  but zipper came of from one side.. trying to fix it the other side came off..
"I would like to exchange these pants for the relaxed fit style. They are way too tight even though they are correct size. I have never returned anything if you look at my purchase history. I had an illness in the family in another state and have had no time to return these. Please allow me to return these and get bigger style. My husband needs these for work! Thank you so much Ellen Longenecker
ellenlongenecker@gmail.com"
They were made weird. The toe was so skinny and the heel was so big. I have wanted these for so long. I was dissapointed. Had to send back.
"The sandals run a bit small. That in itself wouldn't bother me too much, but they're also surprisingly flimsy. My daughter grabbed and immediately ran outside in them or I'd have returned them."
"it was way too small for me, the color was nice but slightly darker than in the picture."
Emma Bearpaw boots are smaller fitting than other Bearpaw boots I have purchased. They fit tighter around calf and do not offer the comfort my other styles do. Will be returning.
"First off, the fabric is thin...VERY thin. The mfr. calls the fabric 100% cotton. I call it 100% threadbare.
Second and finally, the fit is tight. Not so tight to be unwearable, but tight enough to be a disappointment.
What really bothered me were the legholes. They were way tight and way uncomfortable.
That's my story and I'm sticking to it.

By the way, I see in this product listing that Amazon sells these both new and used. Used underwear? Really??"
"i bought this item after reading all the good reviews and i was really happy when i received my shoes i liked the leather and the color  but when i tried it on i felt really disappointed .. i ordered size 10 when i always wear since more than 20 years , 10= 40 EUR this is what i always wear ,when i tried i on it was very big like size 11 or even 12 it even written on the shoes 10/41.5 ??? i was like ha!! a size and a half up ??? , when i contacted the sellers they were not helpful , although i explained my case to them,,, very disappointed"
"Extremely narrow! I ordered the wide width and they aren't wide at all. Adorable shoes, but too hard to get on my childs foot."
"Runs small, cute shirt though."
I loved these rings but unfortunately after one use the gold on one of them came off.
Top is very thin and the quality is not good. Kind of disappointed
Loved the socks. It is very disappointing that one of the pair of socks had a hole in it the first time I tried to put the sock on. Colors of the socks are good.
"Crotch ripped out on first use.  Material seems to be good, but poor stitching."
Not ribbed. Got xxl. Way too small. I am an xl/xxl size 16/18.
I did not like these Body Shapers Cami Tank Top because they gave no support at all.  I returned them for a refund.
Was torn and no way this fits any woman's chest!
the writing on the insole wore out in a week
returned.  It was to large.
I ordered a size M. The concept of the shirt was great but it was so long on me and im not too short 5'4. This shirt could go for a dress or a night gown. I reached a little above my knees. The material was very nice and light
"I love those shoes, I've buying a lot of pairs. But this last write pair of shoes came with defects. I'm very disappointed about that."
I take my review back because it worked for the first trip then i did not use it and it would not work it would turn off when i lift it to weigth my bag very dissapointed
"I thought my search for a dress to take anniversary pictures in the park in ended when I saw this dress.  The reviews were good but when I got the dress it was WAY to big for me.  I got a small and I am 5'3 155 pounds.  It just had no shape on me and just drooped everywhere on me and I am not a very small person at all. I wear a medium in other size clothes. The concept and idea is very cute and the model pulls it off but for me, it's a no no.  an XS would have probably worked but they didn't have it.  I hope this fits pretty on someone else."
"Terrible! Does not look like picture. First of all the arms fit weird. Too short and stiff around arm pit. Then theres a ton of material in the middle. Its heavy, bulky, and incredibly unflattering. If I were pregnant with triplets this would be great! However, Im not pregnant and don't need the excess material. This dress gets a major thumbs down."
These did not work and kept breaking
"I just received these studs today, I was very exited about opening the box, I was expecting to find a simple but beautiful earnings but my disappointment was too much when I found they hadn't the regular pinkish tone of freshwater pearls, they're almost yellow!!. The backs are very loose and poor quality. At least they weren't so expensive."
"I wanted this to be a hit, but the ruffles on the bottom ripped pretty easily and overall it just felt cheaply made"
It broke in one used! Not recommend
Way too huge.  Basically just a piece of fabric with no shape.  The quality is awful with strings hanging off the edges and uneven hems.
"very very tight.  The size 7 was ridiculously tight on my 7 year old son, but luckily my 4 year old girl will wear them.  The 4-7 I bought for my daughter are also ridiculously tight, but they took tags off, so Ill give those to an infant I suspect."
"The reviews made these seem amazing. I thought that they actually looked quite cheap. They were also uncomfortable and slippery. As in, I nearly slipped walking across my kitchen. Not worth it."
"A decent bag but does NOT do what I was looking for it to do. I wanted a carry on bag with garment bag feature. This bag claims to have design that would not crumpled the suits. I had a different experience, causing me to get dryclening and pressing some of my suite at the destination. The bag otherwise is study. The wheels are fine and go through rugged surfaces fine. The handle got stuck one time and didn't pull through tall the way."
"Received my boots today and they did not have the fleece inside. Returning.  I checked them out at a store in the mall and these totally look fake. I'm a Timberland wearer and I noticed soon as I took them out the box. I don't know how some of these review are saying that they love them. They are not what is in the picture or what I seen in the store. Now, Timberland does make a pair without the fleece but these still don't look right. I am just gonna pay full price at the mall."
These flip flops are nicely made and look like they would hold up well. They have great arch support too.  My sister swears that they are the most comfortable flip flops around.  I have a wide toe box so I got the unisex flip flops based on my sisters recommendation.  they are too floppy for my wide foot.  the sole of the shoe is the correct width but the upper canvas straps are too loose.  I regret that I will be sending them back.
XL - fits a size M in juniors. Well constructed just sizing and dimensions listed were completely off!
"I was really looking forward to getting these boots. When I tried them on they were about a size too big, not a huge issue I'd just return them for a smaller size. As I was taking a closer look I noticed that both boots had a problem with the stitching on the tongues. As the problem was with both boots and not the same area on both boots, (one had the left side and the other was on the right side of the tongue) I decided to ask for a refund as I had lost confidence in the quality of the product. I re-ordered from another source."
"Ordered size 12 W but one foot always seemed tight, I thought it was my foot until I checked my shoes today. I received 1 shoe (Left) of the correct size 1 your 2 W & 1 shoe (Right) of wrong size 12 M. Please be careful & check your shoes immediately post delivery to ensure you get what you ordered for."
This thing shrunk like a motherfather.  It was way too big and then after one wash (warm water) and one dry (med heat)  it fits more like a Medium.  I would get a different shirt.
"they lasted 7 months and the sole started to separate. another month or two and its going to fall off probably. I put them through extreme conditions, but I think they should have lasted a little longer for the price they are. UPDATE: on my second pair (I got them because size 16 light boots are hard to find) I am going to lower my rating to one star. because in about a month the left boot started hurting my toe. by feeling with my hand down in the boot, I could feel a crinkle in the roof of the boot above my toes, and it was a hard wrinkle from the inner leather toe lining, it put an unbearable pressure/pain on my middle toe. I was able to cut it with a knife which collapsed the wrinkle. These boots go through wet stuff and they don't last. I will never buy another pair."
the front is thi big.
"A fairy's long earrings.  Sad to say, not great workmanship."
"horrible. i didn't like it at all  it falls when i walk, and its very  uncomfortable not what I expected"
"These boots aren't ideal for women with thin calves. I was hopeful that the tie in the back would allow me to make the shaft of the boot tighter, and while that worked a little, it wasn't enough to provide a nice fit. I have thin calves, but really just a bit thinner than average- not dramatically so. If it weren't for the fit, I probably would have kept these boots rather than returning. They are cute, though didn't seem comfortable enough for a full day's worth of wear."
"Way too tight, stiff and scratchy and hard to pull up. Wore it once and it was very uncomfortable. Too small as well. Should have sent it back."
"Very cheaply made.  Packaging was extremely poor and inadequate.  One of the links was broken on the necklace.  This is just for a Halloween costume, so hopefully I can fix it.  Will not buy from them again. Will not recommend them either."
Quality not so good
I don't have a big head (size s/m in fitted hats) and these things are comically tight on my head. I don't know who they are marketed for but they aren't very good. I bought the purple tinted to help while golfing (purple lenses tone down all the green on the course) but they didn't do a great job because they are barely colored at all. I ended up just biting the bullet and buying a pair of Oakleys that were specifically designed for golf use. Don't waste your money.
They scuffed up pretty fast.  She only wore them a few times and fell apart.
"On the model these jeans look like they fit with a narrow leg. They look like a slender fit.  However, the legs are very wide!  They looked like baggy elephant trunks on my legs.  Yuck.  I sent them back. (I ordered size 12)."
"If these were $20 slippers I'd be relatively satisfied. They are comfortable, look nice and pretty warm. However the fleece is coming out in chunks, so I don't foresee them lasting very long at all. I expected much better quality for the price and so should you!"
"The jeans fit as expected and look fine.  But, as they wash the color is changing with a brown or muddy look in the denim."
"I love Cherokee. I love all the pockets but these where way too big on me. I had to return them. Wish they made this style to fit women. I'm 5'3"" 125lb and ordered a small. They where too long and just too big. "
They were too small not true to size unfortunately I threw away the packaging so im stuck with them very disappointed
"The sizes do not seem to be consistent at all.  I purchase a large a while ago which fit perfectly and was thrilled because my foot size is difficult to find and these were very comfortable.  Then, after a repeat order, I could immediately see that they were much larger just by looking at them without unwrapping.  These were returned to exchange for a pack of medium expecting them to be somewhere between large and small.  The mediums I received were too small, so small in fact that a small would not have been the correct scale to the large, medium, small.  Unfortunately, I unpackaged them to see if they could be stretched to fit and could not be returned.  Also, while some of the mediums almost fit, others were smaller.  If I can't find another brand to my liking, I guess I'll have to try the large again to wash a few times and hope they shrink."
Thought this was larger when I bought it. I'll be returning it. Once I saw it less elegant in person.
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.  cheap and the material stinks
It is small size
Special gift for the father of my daughter and it came broken. He had to go out and buy a chain for it as soon as he opened the package.
"When we received these shirts, my husband tried one on and it fit well.  After we washed them in cold water, even though they were preshrunk, they did not fit well anymore.  Also, and this is almost unbelievable, after my husband wore the shirt for one and a half hour, the collar began to curl.  These were advertised as stay flat collars. I am sending these back. They are poor quality."
"I was not very happy with this particular Hue product. I own several different pairs of Hue jeans and skinny. This was very thin material and on the large size. I would have returned, but I moved and I am out of the alowd time frame to return."
Broke before I even wore it.
again ankle issue too large and it doesnt fit your foot properly alot of spaces where there shouldnt be none.
Athletic walking? Call it what it is. It's a trail shoe. Skinny in the toe and sole is really hard. They tried to provide the cushioning with insoles instead of the midsole where it should be.
The slit in the back ends at the small of my back. Can't wear it. Otherwise it would be a beautiful dress.
"I love these shoes they were so cute, fit perfectly and were wonderfully comfortable.  But after wearing them one time the outsole came completely off, it just came unglued from the top of the shoe.
Returned them, super disappointed."
said it was cotton. It was 65% polyester....I'm allergic.  Customer service was exceptional and got a refund
"From the picture these looked like quality wool socks with a decent thickness. Socks are very thin, feel thinner than cotton socks. Embroidery is not raised as the picture may look but woven throughout the sock. This may be a misinterpretation on my part but I expected an actual raised embroidery. From the picture the color looks to be a two-tone dark and light grey. Actual color is light grey and dark brown. I wish the other reviewers had provided an actual review to make an informed decision, good if you are looking for a thin brown and grey wool sock."
Ordered to gift to a newborn and these hats are the same size as my husbands men's beanies and it fits his head easily.  NO WAY these will ever fit a baby.
This product comes from China and the sizes are like for a child that are way too small. Doesn't fit right and it's going right in the garbage. Don't spend your money on this.
"I got these all in black and unpacking them the plastic hangers shot through the socks snagged on the socks first thing.  I then washed and dried them before wearing them.  They came out of the dryer unwearable, hundreds of pills on each sock.  You might be able to wear these if you hand wash each sock individually.  I also noticed that they are literally different sizes, lengths, i.e. there is no quality control on the sizing of these socks nor on the lack of a quality product.  Ripped off by this product and steaming about why Amazon would carry such a sub, sub, sub standard product???  Maybe the other colors and patterns are different but I don't know and wouldn't risk two cents to find out!  I rarely if ever write reviews for products here at Amazon, but when a product is this unusable, I believe fair-warning should be given by customers."
"These are said to be 'regular fit'. They are NOT. They are 'extra room in thigh', which is on the tag. That is NOT regular fit."
It is small and color is totally different :( My hubby couldn't wear it at all and we had to send it back. We were expecting the BROWN which how it is on the pic but it came out different
construction and material feel cheap.
Not what I wanted. It's not like the picture. The color was more like gray.
tight shoes
"It kind of works... I gave it 24 hours to try on the two rings I wanted to wear, but after 1 day it fell off.  I tried it again by putting more on and wrapping it around the ring, and had the same issue.  I wouldn't recommend"
I am so very disappointed in this Shoe. I have plantar fasciitis and these shoes do not help. I just spent $150 for nothing!
"Nice fabric, smooth and seamless, long to allow full coverage even when bending over  but very form fitting.  I did want a smooth sleek look BUT I feel like I am wearing Spanxs! I would order your size if you don't mind every detail shown, but I think it best to go a size up.  M/L more like an 8 not 10/12."
This head band is already broken.
Didn't like the quality of the material. Too hot.
Synthetic material extremely wrinkle prone. Definitely need a petty coat and professional pressing. I'm 5ft4in 34D I weigh 140lbs wear size 7/8  Dress. Cap(headdress) is very cheap.
This hat is massive. Will not fit you unless you have a head the size of a watermelon.
Fell apart in less than a year
Both pair are very uncomfortable!
Shoe not  true to size. Went on vacation hopefully I can send them back. She wears a 3.5. If I had know would have gotten size bigger. Oh well
Tiny and non flexible.  To get even a slight bend you have to force it and risk breaking.  It tightly fits my pinky finger which was not the  intended finger though it is my fault for assuming it would be larger like similar items.
This was thee single worst belt ever. I bought it for my dad for Christmas and not even a full week and the belt is worn out. Do not buy! It's cheap material.
Returned it because the colors were faded and not vibrant as posted
"These boots are cute and fit well, but this review is for whomever sent them. These arrived a week and a half later than expected in a ripped open box that was covered with grease. I'm glad that these boots are sturdy otherwise they'd be ruined."
"meh, wouldnt buy again."
Cute shoes but after first wear the bottom edge is pulled away from the shoe at the end of the toe area. I'm disappointed at this cost that the show would come apart right away. It makes me wonder if they are authentic or not. Do Chuck Taylors normally do this? (insert sad trombone sound)
"I love these guys - I have 3 now. When I got the white one in, it had a nice cream stain on it so I won't be keeping it. The other two are awesome."
"My son and i liked this watch, but its not a year yet and the watch doesnt work, its not the battery and i don know if it was even worth it, very dissapointed"
"The bust area offers zero support, and for those of us with little in that area to begin with, it makes your chest look flat and very unflattering. It's also too short for people that are tall (I'm 5'8"" and it rested in that awkward place between your ankle and calf... not sexy) I had to return it..."
"I have had a lot of good experiences with New Balances, but these shoes didn't really do it for me. The fit felt a little long in the toes and the color scheme looked better online then in person (the shoes seemed to have a glossiness / sheen to them)."
"These are beautiful boots, but they are not very comfortable.  There's chance you could break them in, but it would be cruel to your feet.  It was disappointing."
"When I removed these from the package, at least 2 pairs already had a hole in them.  It appears they weren't knit together really tight where the holes are.  Disappointed."
"Received these boots, they smelled awful. Even my 3 year old noticed this. We returned them."
"I have ordered many beautiful clothes for my granddaughter, but this item was very cheaply  made and definitely not the usual.quality I have come to expect from Amazon."
"Real poor quality wristband. The ""leather"" band fell apart after only a few times wearing it. If you choose to buy this watch, get a good aftermarket wristband."
"This isn't even really a sweat shirt. it's a long sleeve tshirt shaped like a sweatshirt and the sizing in way off! I wear a small/med and ordered the extra large, it was skin tight. Too bad, it is a cute design."
"I hate them, I wish I had sent them back"
"Color does not match the outfit for which they were ordered. Shoes looked very cheap, were not made well, and even though I ordered a bigger size, they were still a bit small.  One heel is off center and hangs off the side of the shoe, and for this reason I have to give them this rating.  However, customer services for this company has been very kind and helpful in allowing me to choose a handbag to replace the shoes.  For this reason, I rate my experience with the company as """"."
"Size 2E proved to be too small so I have not worn these much. They still look new. But instead of breaking them in (I hoped they would become comfortable), I just plain broke them: the sole separated from the shoe at the back after a dozen hours of wear. Glue failure. Too bad. New Balance used to be such a great brand. But the last two pairs have literally fallen apart due to faulty adhesives. ""Made in the USA"" ain't what it used to be, I guess."
"The sweatshirt fit as expected, but color was faded like it had been washed too much. Not happy with the true color.  It looks like it should be a bright color but it is just very dingy looking."
"Shoes are very soft and very comfortable, but should wear them with socks in water. They gave me blisters where the tongue is attached to the body of the shoe just by trying them several times on dry feet. In water it may become a wound. I returned the shoes."
"I bought this for my daughter and before she even wore it once the center piece fell out, the item is cheaply made."
"I bought these for the office and casual wear. they are decent quality, though the stitching is poor compared to loafers from before the outsourcing. they loog good, and fit well, but the man- made foot bed is very thin and creates sore feet very fast, the uppers are made from decent leather and the soles are good as well. If you buy these realizing you will need a pair of inserts in them, then you are fine."
"uncomfortable, clunky, difficult to walk in"
The Jeans are ok although the material seems much thinner than normal and size runs small. The main problem is I ordered two pair and its been over 100 days and the second pair has not arrived. Canceling that part of the order now.
so cheap & fake looking
"Sad these weren't better made shoes, the fit as snug, but they eventually wore out. The shoes get dirty very easily and offer NO arch support..."
"awkward size. like, too long to look cute. i gathered up the hem and made a knot on the side circa 1986 and it looks sorta cute w/ skinny jeans."
Fit terribly small.  Very unhappy with this purchase.
"Reviewers said the shoes were terrible, but I had to try them for myself... They are TERRIBLE! I wore them for 90 minutes walking along the beach, in and out of the surf, and by the time I was back at my car, they had fallen apart! The insole was loose and moving around, and the mesh on the top of the shoe had started to fray. Because I had not worn them immediately, I was over the 30 return limit, and could not send them back. I gave the pair I had bought my husband away, and put my shoes in the trash. Save your money, believe the reviews, and DO NOT BUY!"
Runs very small.  Gave it away.
CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP it was broken when i received it.
Why would they ever make black face socks. Tacky. Unacceptable.
"I got a medium and the bottoms are way too tight... They fit like an extra small. But the top fits like a medium so it's hard to choose a size. I gave the bottoms away and was going to wear the top with different bottoms but one of my straps broke the first day I tried to wear it and I hate strapless bathing suits so I won't wear it without the straps. The bathing suit was super cheap quality and even though it's inexpensive, it's a waste of money."
It's kinda small.
The buckle is bulky and ugly.  Not dressy at all.
"The sole is very stiff, not soft at all as it is described. The thong design is awfuland blister my toe."
Not as pretty as the pic but OK.
"Cheap product. Seams came unraveled after second wear. Someone tried to fix a hole on the front of mine with white string! I didn't notice until after I'd cut the tags, otherwise I'd have returned it. Would be a cute style if not for those issues."
"as all the rest, the pocket is not large enough"
Not what expected but haven't got time to return. I could wear it if im entertaining at home
"The bottom was way too large. The bottom stripped part had a huge gap! Too was doable. But the suit lacked the ""pow"" I was looking for!"
I have never had a problem with JRENEE shoes. A little hard.
Arrived damaged!
Fit not at all as expected.
"This jacket is very cheaply made. It is very thin and more like a light sweater as opposed to a jacket or coat. The belt does not have loops so if you don't tie it, it will fall off."
Shrinks after one wash.
"Super soft and comfy, but had a hole in it after only one time wearing it."
"The picture does not properly reflect how poorly constructed the shoe is made. My balls of my feet ached badly and the heel did not support the back making as though I was walking in flip-flops. The soles were heavier than most shoes I buy. Luckily, Amazon promptly refunded my purchase."
Ripped with one use.
Im a 34D and when I put this bra on I felt like it made them a weird shape... almost pointy and far apart. I disliked it even more when I put a shirt on over it.
"Following what others have said, I ordered a size larger. I could not even fit my toes into the boot that is how small these run. glad i got them on sale. horrible sizing issues"
"I won't order another one but it's not my favorite. Perhaps a little small but this fabric also has absolutely no stretch at all so that might be part of the problem. Wore it to yoga last week and it did keep everything ""in place"" but I felt my side-to-side movement restricted at times. With large breasts, there's always a trade off between range of motion and too much motion. This bra seems to skewed towards the former. Maybe better for someone doing aerobics or running."
Daughter received them as a Christmas present and a month and a half later the whole bottom of the boot is coming off both boots!! And can't return because it's over 30 days!!
If you are larger than a size 10/12 this item will not fit correctly. I am fairly small and I should have noticed in the picture that the line for this robe is straight down.  There is an enclosed tie at the waist which was the only reason that the robe stayed closed at the top. The bottom of the robe will reveal all of what a robe should conceal.  What is good about this is that is a light summer full length robe and priced low.  I think I will return this item.
"The boots themselves are absolutely lovely and have exactly the look I was going for. However, I have smaller calves and was wholeheartedly disappointed that even with the straps I have been unable to get them to fit correctly. It is clear that these were designed for larger women so please be advised if you are a smaller person, that these might not be the right boots for you or may require alteration."
"PHOTO IS MISLEADING... the headband makes it totally cute right? Sadly, it isn't included.  Quality of pants and shirt are not very great, so... I would have passed on this one."
"I heard great things about this shoes from youtube, but it did not work out for me.
On the back of the shoe, where you see that little loop, the fabric just under there is sharp and it rubbed against my ankle causing irritation leading to callus. This is a design flaw on NB's part.  Because I live in TX, shippping the shoe back to the seller in the UK would leave me a $10 refund.  I've decided to cut out the back with a scissor."
THE BOOTS FIT OK
"This ring did not hold up, turn color lose sapphire."
Not very comfortable but keep your feet dry.
"Fits great and extremely comfortable, I've ordered 2 pairs now....the only problem is the seam in the butt starts the seperate. Both pairs did the same thing. I really loved these pants too because the material is soft and looks great on but didn't last long at all. By the second washing there was rip in the butt."
This is another type of bra. Not the Ahh Bra like it says in the listing. No support and no coverage. Useless.
"The wrists on this are far too tight! Super cute, but we ended up picking a new one."
"Laces cut right through the eye-holes on top-most eyes.  I had to put in some gromets to allow me to use the top holes without further tearing/cutting of the holes.
Soles on heel are some kind of laminate and are peeling off.  Rubber is peeling off of right shoe and heal (top back) is peeling from left shoe.

This is after 1 week.

Avoid these shoes.

I've had $15 shoes to big-box-mart last a lot longer than this.

In my photos you can see the sole de-lamination and the eyelets I had to add to keep the eyes together."
"I do not own this specific watch, but I do own several Seiko kinetic watches.  Not one of them still works.  Seiko leads you to believe you will never need a battery for your watch.  Not true.  They use a rechargeable battery (capacitor) that eventually will no longer retain a charge and need to be replaced, usually within 3 years or so.  This will cost you $75-150 for most kinetic watches, and if you own a kinetic auto-relay watch many jewelers will not work on it.  You will spend far less money buying watches that need regular battery replacement.

After owning 4 Seiko kinetic watches, some of which I paid well over $500 for, I have given up buying any more Seiko kinetic watches.  They are a huge rip-off.  Buyer beware."
This ring has sharp edges and is not as finely finished as it should be. My daughter caught her hand in the door and the ring crushed on her finger. The ring could not be salvaged. My other celtic band rings are of much higher quality.
"I am returning these simply because they were tried on prior to receiving them and the right heal had already been broken down from someone smashing it down.  I tried to lift with the tab, used shoe horn, but the heal folded in and rubbed ankle.  Also were soiled inside the heal.
The shoes are really cute, great colors, fit my difficult foot, wide enough.  I did not wear long enough to know if arch support which is moderate would have been good enough all day.  I did notice thought fatigue immediately under forefoot."
"These have a nice fit and were not real tight. No sagging. They looked nice under my slacks. However, because the toe is not reinforced, I had a runner the first day. Too bad."
Does not match up with size chart
"I found these shoes to be really cute, but I returned them without even putting them on my child's feet because there were mold spots on the inside of both shoes.  I literally took them out of the package and could tell right away something was wrong.  There were brown mold spots on the interior and although the shoes didn't smell like mold, they didn't have a very pleasant smell.

*I originally received this item at a discount to provide an honest review. My opinions are 100% my own and in no way influenced by the seller."
"My husband bought these from my wish list. I wish I hadn't put them on there.

They are barely adequate in length.  I am 5'7""  and they barely cover from below knee to ankle without any scrunching at all.  Look at the sales picture...they are shown scrunched which implies extra length.  The person in the photo must be 4 feet tall.
I haven't washed them, yet and if they shrink , they will be useless to me.

I would NOT recommend this for fashion wear at all. The edges are poorly finished."
I sent this item back over one year ago.
"The top didn't come far enough up on my foot, so the metal piece hit right on the big toe bone. Ouch. Plus pretty flimsy for that price. Sending back."
Didn't even come close to fitting
"I have fine hair and had hoped that if I used just a real, tiny amount it would be okay, but not so at all.  No amount of this is small enough for fine hair, period.  I gave my bottle to a girl at the office who has a full head of thick medium length hair, and she really likes it, said even her husband likes it on his super long beard.  So it's a good product, obviously, just have to have the hair for it, which I do not.  Thanks!"
But awesome color
I will NEVER order this product again
"This bra technically fit I guess, but while somehow, smashing the breasts into the armpits as well as turning them out in a conelike way as if they were running away from each other. Very disappointed."
Too large so I sent these back. The lining was slippery as well. I didn't reorder this type of sandal.
"The dress and sleeves were different sizes.  I could not get my arms in the sleeves (size 2XL). Unfortunately I was very dissappointed, I thought the dress was pretty."
there is a weird design flaw that makes the wires poke out away from your body where the bra meets at your cleavage.  This shows through your clothing & looks ridiculous.
Straps too tight
The bag was a lot bigger than it look online.
veryyyy smallll
False advertisement! The g-string is not as pictured. The teddy runs really small. I ordered the next size up after reading the reviews thinking it would fit but to my disappointment it didnt.
Quite small. Was really disappointed. I haven't used it.
The color is darker than I wanted/needed.
Very uncomfortable.  The insoles feel like I'm walking on boards.  If I keep them I need to get cushion insoles.  I like the design but when I got them I put them on to break them in and had to take them off after 30 minutes.
"Considering the price I paid for it, I suppose I shouldn't complain. However, it broke into a million pieces after dancing for a few hours at a wedding. Would not suggest buying"
"It looked like a great idea.  Being large breasted makes it difficult to find a good fit.
The design of this bra makes it difficult to put on and take off.
The cup size would have been fine except for the excessive amount of material between the cups.
That made the bra overly bulky and unwearable.
I wish someone could make a bra ( of any kind, sports or every day wear ) that was sized right for large breasted women without assuming that the cup size meant ""large"" all over.
I measure of a 36 G(G).
Unfortunately, I'll have to return this and start my search all over again.
Services with Amazon are excellent.  My review reflects the product only."
"Very good looking shoes, but I'm not accustomed to wearing heels, so these actually hurt a lot.  Some reviews said to order a size down so that's what I did and the heel of the shoe just dug into my own heel, I felt that if I wore it for even more than a few minutes I would have cuts on both heels.  OUCH.  Good lookin' shoes though.  I think I should just buy heels in an actual store, so I can see what I'm getting myself into!"
Not much to review.. It is a shirt
"I'm so disappointed, I needed these in a hurry and prayed the size I bought based off of reviews would fit, but they didn't. Other reviews said they ran big and that you should order a size (at least) down. I shouldn't have, and even then, I'm not confident they would've fit still. My poor baby's sausage feet were too wide/tall to get his foot in. Other reviewers must have been thinking of length only. I'll need to see if I can stretch them out for him to somehow still use them.

He usually wears a size 6(T) and I bought the size 5. I'll post pictures soon for you to reference too."
"Quality is terrible. When they arrived the first thing I had to do was trim loose threads from where they hemmed to keep the yarn unravelled.

They're too small, and I have thin arms. Unless you're really petite and small and almost certainly female, they won't even come close to fitting. They would work for a child or young teenager.

Nonetheless I plan to use them for the time being because I need something to keep my hands warm and my fingers free due to Raynaud's. If they don't fall apart like I expect and/or loosen up a bit to fit more comfortably from use, I might add a star. Maybe. In the meantime? I can't recommend these.

UPDATE:
3 months later, they're falling apart something fierce. There are two holes between two different pairs of fingers. There was three holes at one point, but I mended one of them. The hem is completely undone on one, and it's probably only a matter of time before that one straight up starts unravelling. I haven't even tried washing them yet because I'm afraid they'll fall apart completely (fortunately, they don't stink and aren't stained). I don't even use the gloves daily most of the time, only when it's cold.

Dropping a star. I would have expected these to last at LEAST 6 months before really beginning to disintegrate despite the poor quality when they arrived."
They didn't fit the way I wanted to so I didn't end up wearing them. I gave them to another family member.
"This sandal is not for wide feet. It squeezed my foot and was very uncomfortable
to walk in. I sent it back."
"Way, way, way too small. We ordered a 1X and i couldn't put it on my chihuahua. But I will admit the material was quality if I could wear it. Returned it."
"I've only had these for two months and they already suck, the cheap, imitation wool inside comes out after a week or two. I guess you should wear socks with them I don't know, either way they cause your feet to sweat and eventually rot. I should have passed them up, the box they were shipped in would have made better clogs, Seriously! Not recommended!"
I normally wear 16-18 so I purchased a 3xL and I guess because of my thick thighs I can't pull it all the way up. If it wasn't for that I would be ok.
Wares out quickly
"Size, look, design, and functionality was just what I was looking for, but this is very poorly made.  I bought it for the design features (needed the crossbody strap) and the water resistance for rainy weather.  Needed the large size for carrying winter extras since I commute on the bus daily for work, but I've only used it for a week now and it does not hold it's shape and the bottom is already falling apart.  Great idea, but poor quality.  Not worth the price.  Guess I'm in the market for one with the same functionality but made sturdier.  Would not recommend."
Didn't look like picture and too big.  I know my ring size
"Broke within 1 week of wearing it. I was able to fix it by using super glue to reattach the cords to the clasp, which speaks more to the quality of the super glue than the necklace."
These do not fit close to the lens of glasses. Poor design!
"waist fits good but legs too baggy and pockets too shallow, phone keep falling out"
"Yes it fit but I think it's kind of a stretch to call it ""one size"". I think on a smaller girl, it would have looked better and that was disappointed. Especially because I am not very big. I normally wear a size 10-12 so I feel like one size should at least fit that.  For the price it was decent, but I wouldn't recommend this. It just looks awkward."
"Too small, too tight & not at all what i was looking for. I wanted more of a gored type skirt."
I returned this item. My friend with size 6.5 feet has some and loves them. I ordered my size in 9.5. They look like plastic bags for your feet in this size :/
Most of my heels are 8.5 and I buy 9 in sneakers and boots. Bought these as a 9 and they were extremely small.
YOU DON'T GET what is pictured!!!!
"Thin, cheap material.  Plus very, very small.....does not run true to size...."
"I am 5'5 wear about 190lbs, I ordered a size large, and it is big, definitely runs big, so I suggest you go a size down from your normal. The material is very soft and definitely good quality. Would order again."
Wasn't pleased with this outfit. I bought a few of them all the same Disney baby just different patterns. The shirts all run super small. I bought 3/6 size and the shirts are like 3mo and the pants are huge more like 6/9 I struggle to get the shirts over my daughters head and are really short so her belly hangs out. and the pants fall off. Sad since they are so cute.
"arch of boot is too tight,...hard to get on or off"
"Let me start by saying that this item is REALLY BEAUTIFUL! It is very sheer & lacy & the color is gorgeous!  It looks just like the photo.
That's the only nice thing I can say about this, tho.

I WANT TO SAY THAT IF YOU ARE AS SKINNY AS THESE MODELS IN THE PHOTOS, YOU WOULD NOT BE BUYING SHAPE WEAR!!  IF I LOOKED LIKE THIS MODEL, I WOULD NOT BE LOOKING AT THIS ITEM! I AM A REAL WOMAN WITH REAL CURVES. Maybe a little too real.

I got the LARGEST SIZE available, but when I put this on, it ends up making MY ROLLS even MORE PROMINENT! The cup portion doesn't come close to covering my bra. It ends up looking like two strips of lace going down my breast.

I am going to keep this item, tho. It truly IS beautiful! I'm hoping that I will be able to wear it soon. Or give it to my daughter."
This shoe runs small and narrow at the toe
Bought this as a Birthday gift and I know for a fact that I'd ordered this in black. When it arrived the shirt was in a metal grey color. So beware that probably you won't get the black. Should had listen to the other comments. Whose ever in charged of sending these shirts out shouldn't be doing this in the dark...get your colors correct please..lucky my buddy love the show...
Way to small for baby only
Unfortunately they have nickle in them even though they are silver! So I can't wear them coz my ears swell & itch. I loved them & got lots of compliments. I ordered them coz it said no nickle
"Ok so I recieved the bra through a friend because I am an international buyer, so those out there be careful of how you order this bra size. It is not too bad of a quality but the size is small. I believed i ordered a 34DDD, i can wear that or a 34G.. not sure which one I ordered. I am fairly full with a small back and I really was looking forward for a strapless bra. However, my fault for not going into a store to get a bra right? sighs.
So the size you order, it will be a cup less for uk size, however mine seem to be 2 cups smaller because they sent me a 34E :("
I just received these and they are a decent pair of sunglasses for the price.  I rated them a 2 star because they are definitely not a light green shade as pictured. It's a deeper shade of green.  Wish they would picture as it really is.
No way I could walk in these because the were snug around the ankle and my foot just kind of hung from there. Super cute though so I was disappointed.
"The first pair I bought was ok, save for turning fading all over everything in the washer the first time I washed them and the waist button failing the second time I wore them. I can't tell you much about the second pair I bought because it's been a month, and they haven't been shipped to me yet."
this ring is absolutely not durable whatsoever. idk what these other people are thinking saying it's so unique and wonderful..this looks like it came out of a 25 cent machine or a sewer. the paint chips off and it is not shiny like the picture. titanium my ass.
Watch does not keep correct time
"Super cute but the fit was extremely weird. These would be great for extremely wide, stubby feet. The quality is like something you'd find hanging on a discount slipper rack at Wal-Mart."
"This was smaller / tighter than expected.  I typically wear an XL and ordered an XL.  It was NOT flattering.  Fabric was thin, so showed every bulge underneath.  I returned it."
"These sneakers are not typical Stride Rite quality! Within 2 days, the images of Anna/Elsa fell off. The tongue of the shoe has started peeling where the silver material is and now it's black. Within a week, the shoes look like they're months old and are fraying all over. My daughter says they're comfortable but she's embarrassed to wear them because they look so ratty. Such a disappointment and not what I expected from Stride Rite."
"Not happy with these shoes, but didn't find out until tried wearing them all day at work.  The heel folds in when slipping on and they didn't hold my orthotics very well.  would have returned, but had worn them."
"My son has had this bag for a year and a half about now. He's in Pre K, so there's not much going into the back pack, but there seems to be a problem with the bottom of the back pack.  It's wearing and almost seeing some holes??? UUmmm I put more stuff in my  back pack than he does and his back pack is getting holes?  Quality is a little bit of a problem here.  My kid love power rangers though."
"The sizes run bigger than expected, not true to size.  Too bad I opened the package; I had to toss them all out.  Waste of money."
very tight fit. It was not comfortable. I could hardly breathe.
Great looking dress but you definitely should buy a size up...it is very snug and you may be showing more than you want to show if you do anything other than stand perfectly still.  Purple is more of a mulberry color than true purple
"I don't understand the way this size is supposed to work - I ordered a Medium size, Petite fit. Apparently that's not how Alfred Dunner thinks. The pants didn't fit - much too baggy."
"Rough, hard, no support."
"This is a very cheap made purse (hence price), it is WAY bigger than it looks in the photo also.  I sent it back because it was not what I was looking for."
I ordered size 34. I received size 30. Sent a photograph in another posting.
"I bought another waist ""snipper"" - same size, which fit perfectly - this one rolls down at the top, and folds up at the bottom. This one, while I like that there's no closure, just didn't fit the way I wanted it to. Sad - it was a good price!"
"Different than the picture!! These pictures show a cardigan, front and back, that ends below the hips and has a mostly straight hem (which I wanted). The cardigan received ends just below the waist in the back, and slopes down to two predominant hanging points in the front. This means I can't wear it the way I wanted, or the way it is SHOWN. NOT what I wanted. Misleading picture. :-("
This is the worst costume I have ever ordered. I am so disappointed. It is a size Small and it is huge. It is baggy and does not look anything like the picture. I feel totally ripped off. I will never order from tis company again.
Not made for girls with thick thighs. :( Not stretchy so they do not come up my thigh enough to stay up and they are really tight on my lower thigh. I'll keep looking but I have returned these.
"This one I did send back but I think had it not been flawed I definitely would have loved it.  I just didn't want to risk getting another one with a defect.  It's a hassle for me to return merchandise; probably because I've bought so much from Amazon.  Beside that it was from a third party and I just recently learned the rules for that!
klmosier@gmail.com"
"I did order the next size up but it was still a bit to snug. I contacted Lees, I was told I needed to send it back myself .
If they used UPS they offer a return service, I probably would have my new shirts, as it is, the Post Office are closed on Saturday in my area so I still have shirts that don't fit. I will think twice before I order from this company again."
"I had high hopes for this dress. Sadly, I have a reasonably long torso, and when it arrived, the bodice of the dress looked like it was meant to have an empire waist, instead of riding on the natural waist. It looked like a computer error in the making of the dress. I contacted Lindy Bop and they helped me send it back to them. I chose not to replace it, given that the shipping cost was pretty high - overseas is never inexpensive... I'd love to try another dress of theirs when I have money to blow again, and I'll happily update my review with any new info from that."
"the belt isn't as pictured, the belt shown is brown but what I got was so dark I cant tell if its black or what, but definitely not brown."
"Not at all slouchy as advertised. Very snug fitting, great comfy hat but definitely not slouchy. Returning to buy real slouchy version."
"Cheap plastic - looks cheap, would not recommend."
"It looked great, and the fit was super cute! But when it got wet, it was entirely see through- NOT GOOD! : ( Extremely embarrassing and I won't ever be able to wear it again."
The blue is closer to grey. I should have researched 6mm because the pearls are very tiny.
Ran after second use.
Very Disappointed. Is Supposed To Be Fleece As StateD But It Is A Light Weight See Thru Polyester.
"Very thin, light, stiff. Runs 1/2 size small. Sounds like you have hard plastic on your feet when walking. The sides of the boot cave in immediately and dig into the sides of your ankle. Cute look but very uncomfortable to wear."
"I love Saucony athletic shoes. I have 6 pairs. The fit is great and they have a comfortble toebox. But the color on the berry/viscoral is off. They look like coral and the photo shows a pretty coral color as well as in the name of this color. But when I received them, they are deep RED! I buy multiple Sauconies for difference in color and outfit coordination, so color accuracy is important to me. These are advertised as a coral color but the only thing orangey or coral on them are the neon coral laces and the very bottom of the outer soles. I have berry Sauconys, and these don't look berry either, as the color name implies. If you want to know what the color is really like, look at the Saucony shoe box. That brick-red color on the outside of all their Saucony shoe boxes is real close to exactly what the shade of red is on these shoes."
They may have been okay except I took them to Goodwill because they slid right down to my ankles.  If this happened in public then there would be the hassle of all the women chasing me.    So I gave them away.  They run way too large.  Oh well.
"Their socks wear out extremely fast and their ""warranty"" won't replace them and their customer service is horrid."
Dissatisfied with the material love it hate the material I wanna cry because it's not at all good material looks like Halloween costume material :'(
XXXL WOULD FIT A CHILD. SMELLED LIKE A HEAVY OIL/GASOLINE SMELL. I HAD TO THROW IT OUT. WASTE OF MONEY!
Very poor quality fabric.  It is such a cute design but made with very poor quality fabric.
"Sadly, I had to send them back even though I absolutely loved the leather faux snake look of them and the kitten heel.  They were too short.  Order 1/2 size larger.  Beautiful shoes, though.  Simple elegance."
"I purchased these with the hopes that if I spent a little more money (on leather/brand name/practical work shoes) I could get more than 3 months out of a pair of shoes. It's been three months now and they have begun to wear out on the inside and separate on the outside. I should have just stuck with cheaper shoes that I don't mind replacing every 3 months. I am a full time server so any shoe that comes near me will get worn out, but I expected better from new balance than this. I WILL say that for the first two months, despite the psychological discomfort caused by their hideousness, they were the most comfortable work shoes I've had in years."
"the jeans fit a bit large but I don't mind. The decorations instead is a bit of a problem. I can definitely feel them when I sit on a wooden bench or on the floor. I should have known. I still like them.
It's been a few more weeks and to my horror I now have noticed that the decorations on my jeans have scratched my wooden chairs. Because of this I am assigning a lower star value to this product."
Much cheaper looking then expected.  Plastic very thin.
"the hat was jammed into the mailbox in a paper envelope.  We can not get the wrinkles out so the hat can not be used. If you have any
suggestions on how to get all the wrinkles out I would appreciate knowing.  Next step will be throw it in trash and make a note of the sellers
name."
I ordered the larger size like stated in the description and the swimsuit is still to small.  I won't recommend to anyone buying swimsuits from the internet.  Go into a mortar and brick building where you can actually try the suit on.  It may have been priced right but it fits all wrong.
"I ordered a larger size than I usually wear but I couldn't even get it on, let alone wear it."
"Unfortunately I received the boots 2.5 sizes larger than I had ordered. The order and receipt had the correct size but the shoes I got were not the correct size so I am not sure how they feel on, they look decent but I decided to return them because I would rather go shopping around for a different boot."
The socks are fine but they still slip down in my shoes. It must be me!
"No shape, cheap fabric.  Feels like tent material, only thinner."
"I returned this item.  I just couldn't get the front to look right.  The material was too loose and hung on the side.  Also, the material felt really cheap - I've seen other reviews of this that mentioned ""Halloween Costume Quality"" as far as the material.  I agree.  But, the return was a breeze and I do appreciate Amazon's customer service."
I was very disappointed with this outfit. It had many hanging threads. This is not what I would expect of Calvin Klein. It was very poor quality.
"Very cute but the pants/leggings ripped at the crotch within hours.  The vest seems entirely too big for an 18mo old.  It's adorable, don't get me wrong, but best for a tall skinny child and not for my little ham."
These run big and are not an attractive fit for my foot.
"I usually love 1928 jewellery, however one of the red stones fell out of this piece after only having had it for a week. I am still trying to find it."
"Great Shoe's, but the laces pulled through the top two eyes after about 6-weeks of riding.  They have a manufacturer's warranty of 1-year, but Five-Ten would not respond to my inquiries on their website.  Very frustrating, since they are great shoes.  At a loss on what to do."
"First of all they smell, and then they loose color. Losing color is normal, but not for this one as both my hands were black while I tried them.

So glad was able to return them, but they suck"
Lace top does not stay up and thigh highs are too short. ( ordered the size I always wear.)  Needed to return the thigh highs.
"It's for SHORT women!  I'm 5'10 so the slit opening starts at my belly button.  The bottom of the piece that should fall at my thighs falls right at my butt.  It's probably great if you're puny, but if you're tall, save your money."
not what I expected. very small so order much larger size
"This coat runs small, particularly in the sleeves. I don't know how they expect anyone to wear a sweater or any other winter clothing under this coat. I was very disappointed."
I'm 5'8 and the armour pieces are to big the mask is lame smells bad and has a huge crease in it
rusts super quickly
PLEASE NOTE THAT I DID NOT ORDER THIS ITEM.L
sorry that it is really really thin... I have already bent it.
SMALL!  These run about 2 sizes smaller I think. Considering there is NO tag in them and they look like they have been worn! So for $30 I think I will stick with buying jeans and pajamas separately
"I loved the boot but had to return it because it doesnt fit.
I have a true size 11 foot and the size 11 boot didn't fit at all. would probably need a 12 but its not offered.

Can't provide any reviews to the quality or durability"
"This pair isn't comfortable compared to my other Vionic sandals.  I love the way they look, but as soon as I slipped them on I knew I wouldn't be able to wear them.  I wish Vionic would use a consistent foot bed so one would be able to buy any pair knowing they would be the same as the other shoes we love.  Sad to say I have to send them back.  I also purchased the Vionic Shore Slide which have a cushiony foot bed.  I wish I could find out what other Vionic sandals have the same foot bet as the Shore Slide!"
"If I could post zero stars I would. Absolutely not what the picture looks like, it is literally a piece of foam with eye holes cut out and two pieces of fabric sewed on to tie around your head. My ten year old could make this. Will be sending them back."
"This ""dress"" is ridiculous. First, it's not a dress, you can't wear it in public, unless you wear it at the beach, over your swimwear. You can't wear it in your house, when you have family around, because is thin, you can see the underwear very clearly. It's that kind of material that it tends to smell when you sweat in the summer. I can't imagine sleeping with it neither, yuck.
They took their time to put notes at the description that colors may differ from the pics, but they didn't explain what material this thing is made of, and they should change the name from ""dress"" to ""beach dress"".
As far as the sizing, I wear Medium and ordered Large, but is too loose for me.
Don't buy, I just threw $10 away."
"Cheap. Breaks easily. I tried cleaning them. After i took them out of the cleaner, they all started to break and chip. Poor ! Definitely a waste of my money."
These shrank and faded very badly after the first wash. A size 14 fit more like a 12. Very tight at the waist.
Returned shoes for a refund; didn't like them enough to  request a smaller size. Seemed like they were men's shoes.
"When I received it, it looked lighter weight than I anticipated but nice. I ordered my normal size, but when I tried it on it was at least two sizes too small. Not even close. I would guess you would need at least two sizes bigger than you ordinarily wear."
"Nice looking shirt but I had to return it. Ordered it in the size I wear but I couldn't even button it up. The cut was like a ""Western Wear"" or ""Fitted"" style shirt and I couldn't wear it. I ordered five of them in different colors and had to return them all...but Amazon sent me an R/A and a UPS label and all I had to do was pack them up, slap the label on the box & take them to a UPS store without any hassle whatsoever. Wish I could say the same for 4 other shirts I ordered that I didn't realize would be shipped as ""Marketplace"" orders from 3 other locations and I had the same problem with those shirts (cut way too small). I had to return those at the post office and pay the return postage which was over 40.00 for 3 packages. I'm still trying to resolve this and Amazon is helping. In order to post this, I see that a star rating is required. Although the shirts looked fine, I don't feel that it's fair to give it a one star rating, so I'll just give it 2 stars and say ""I don't like it"" even though the shirts seemed well made and looked good. It's the fit that's the problem."
Love the colors but handle broke a week into using it. We've got kids but still should be more robust.
Was not what expected.  Little to no support
How are these for a baby! More like toddler!!
"I've been on the hunt for leggings for awhile, and with all the positive reviews, had high hopes for these. To be upfront, I prefer high-waisted leggings with softer waist bands. These were tight with an uncomfortable waist band. It dug into my skin. The material also wasn't very soft."
Maybe these are XL on buzzaro world. Runs really small
"Not worth 25c, the stones are painted plaster, they arrived broken, sent a replacement pair,but still look pretty cheap. Heavy metal, heavy ""stones""."
Not the best quality. Button stopped working after first use.
"For $9.95, I really wasn't expecting very much, but unfortunately this fanny pack is much lower quality than it appears in the picture. It reminds me of those cheap, clear plastic backpacks made for kids. Worse, it smells weird -- sort of like sardines dunked in chemicals. I left it by an open window for a couple days and the odor hasn't faded. The pack is also bigger and bulkier than expected.

I'm sure this would make a great gift for a kid and it would be a perfect accessory for an 80's costume, but it's not what I was hoping for. Returning."
These are terrible quality. I cannot believe Ugg would put their name on these slippers. Ive worn them for one day and they look horrible. Returning immediately. Picture was taken after one day of wear - they already look like they're 5 years old.
"Great concept, but there's others that are much better. If you have a big bust, I don't recommend buying this as it is not easy to get the flanges in and out without hurting your breasts. Great for nursing, not for pumping though."
"These shoes arrived in a different box, in baggies, and had been worn! They don't even earn one star! "
"WAY too small!  Were these for girls, not women?"
"We bought the newborn size but after washing, it would seriously only fit a premie unless you wanted to try to stretch it over your newborn's body. The fabric is pretty thin, so I wouldn't even suggest that. We basically kept it just in case my wife went into preterm labor so we'd have some onesies to fit a premie."
not warm
"The dress is gorgeous. The problem is it is cut EXTREMELY SMALL!!!!! There are also two spots at the neckline that looks like ink spots. Almost like the black bled through the yellow material on the neckline. I hate the fact that the dress is cut so small. The fit is horrible. I ordered a size larger in case it ran small and that was not enough. I won't return it but will give it as a gift to someone who can fit it. I wish it came in a much larger size, I might try to reorder the item."
These were much too small. I have pants a size smaller than these are marked that are bigger than these. also comfort waste band is not very expandable at all. Not like other brands. Had to return.
"It's okay. Looks really cute but there are no adjustment rings.  Like you can't choose a size you'd prefer it to be at, there's only one ring to put the clasp on to.  I ended up attaching some more rings myself to make it a little more loose because it is very tiny but I have a 26inch waist.  If you're smaller than that, you're good, if you're bigger than that, steer clear."
this shirt was cute for ONE wear.  the fabric is cheap and it pilled after one day of wear...would return if I hadn't missed the return window
Bulky and does not have enough hang on it.  It practically covered my mouth!
Horrible fabric. Would not buy again
"The fit was lacking , you have to adjust it often to make it lay properly, otherwise it just bunches and looks frumpy. Along the sleeve hem line it looks like it was sewn and then taken apart and re-done leaving behind holes in the shirt. See attached pictures. The band at the bottom is a off color from the shirt and not the same gray as shown in the advertised picture. I did get it for lightening deal of $8.99, but I will still be sending back."
really small.  ended up returning it.
"I didn't realize that this was an ""outlet version"" of a jacket.  The print doesn't match up at the seams (anywhere!) and it doesn't really drape correctly on the body... but if you need something to wear around the house / run to the grocery store, then it's good enough.  If you work in an office - not really appropriate."
Other panties in the same size fit me perfectly. These feel a little tight and I'm worried about tearing the lace when I put them on. They are very pretty.  UPDATE - the lace pretty much shredded after a couple washes. I thought I'd try the larger size but they are huge on me (and of course you have to open them to find out so I'm stuck with them). I think the first ones were probably the correct size but they are simply too flimsy.
"I had to send this product back twice.  I originally ordered it because the picture shows a back strap on the flip flop to keep it on the foot.  The first pair didn't have a back strap and were huge for the size they were supposed to be.  I ordered a replacement, that didn't have the back strap either, and was still too big."
"This skirt fits horrible unless you have a big, big, big behind. I returned mine for obvious reason. Team flat."
Shoe is too small and narrow. Forgot to return and now they will not take it back. I get I had a window but I lots going on. Now I am stuck with a shoe that i can't wear.
Fits one size smaller than actual size
nope nope nope
"It's a gorgeous dress. Love the melon color. The sizing says up to an XL (which I am) and they are right. However, the dress made me look HUGE. It was unflattering in all areas, especially in the waist. I wanted to like it, but I knew I would never wear it. So, I sent it back and got a refund."
Very awkward!! Its longer in the back than expected (it reaches down below my knees). The front is cute but the back is very unflattering. Perhaps it would look best on a tall and very curvy girl but not for me!
"It can't support its own weight on your ear. They quality is worse than the picture portrays, but it was suuuuuuper cheap."
"When they said thin, they meant it. Turned out significantly thinner than I would've liked."
I have a somewhat narrow foot and these accommodate people with Flinstone feet. Also they are surprisingly heavy for flip flops. I tried the ten and my toes went off the front. the eleven was way too big. I went with the TEVA Toachi 2 instead and am liking them a lot more.
returend them --- way too big
"Hated it.. The gel inside the bra feels horrible!  Sent back right away, it is pretty on and works great but I could not wear it longer than 5 min..."
"I only wore this twice and the clasp is already broken, it's crappy quality do not waste your money!!"
"Shirt is very thin, I do not think it will survive multiple washes. Also it smells kind of funky. Very nice that necklace was sent with the top, but the necklace is cheap as well."
Pitiful don't began to describe this. A hole was in the ring. It is black!! Customer service sucked. Never ever again.
"I was very skeptic about getting this product...but after reading the ""wonderful"" reviews I decided to get it....what a huge mistake!!!!  I'm a C/D cup... and it didn't hold them... too bad, if anyone knows of a product like this one that ACTUALLY works, let me know!

I just read the 5 stars ratings again, and yes, most of them are FAKE.  Pay attention when reading 5 stars reviews, ALWAYS.  I should have done it before buying this horrible product.  I'm sure it might work for A-cups, but definitely not for C, D and on...."
Color doesn't look like the picture. Color is dark and dull looking.
"The first time I wore these jeans, one of the rear belt loops came off at the bottom of the loop.  The inspector must have been absent that day.  The only good news is I have returned them to Amazon and a refund will be issued.  I am sorry that this legendary product is of such poor quality that a belt loop would come off, even without any stress.  If Levi's jeans are made so carelessly, it is shameful."
"I do not normally write bad reviews for a product unless it is really disappointing. Well, this product was more than disappointing. I only wear these shoes indoors and after a week, it ripped and the sole fell apart ! The ""fur"" inside the shoe is all flattened out now. No cushion, and the material is very thin. I felt like the photo is somewhat deceiving when I received the actual product. Save your money and get a higher quality product."
"This is NOT the same dress the model is wearing and you can see it in the customer pics as they all have the difference displayed. How is it different?
1 - There is a seam with what looks like a zipper on the back. This does not exist on the garment you receive. Instead the creases are down the sides where the color blocks are.
2 - The model displaying this has the top come in and hit the shoulder muscles. This is NOT the case with the dress received. Look at the 4 pics women who bought this dress and put it on posted. The top comes in no where near the shoulder muscles, aka midway between shoulder joint and neck. Instead it sits off the shoulder joint. It's blown out immensely.

Other Cons:
- The arms material is not stretchy. So if you have big arms, it's going to be tight and not give. if you have thin arms, they are going to swim in it. There is no give and no stretchiness. (Look at the customer pics again, you can see in one of them it's folding over on itself on the arms).
- This is a $15 dress with a $25 price tag
- The tag is on the side seam at the bottom, no clear indication which is front and which is back. Normally this isn't an issue, but since the top is so BLOWN OUT WIDE it's not an 'at a glance you can tell' type deal. Instead you gotta line it up and be like.. ok that's my front that's my back.

Pros:
- Delivers quickly.
- The sizes are actually American in size and it fits as expected per size ordered but not design wise."
NOT TRUE TO SIZE AT ALL!
Sucks woukd not fit and took over a month to get here
"Very cute and decently made, but way way too small. If you can, order at least two sizes larger than you would normally wear."
I bought these for my daughter. She likes to be with her dad around the farm and I wanted her to have some safe footwear. When she saw them she was very happy. We both liked the look of them and they're waterproof too. She started wearing them right away. Then her ankles started to hurt so badly that she had to take them off and now she won't wear them at all. I'm going to get her some real thick socks to see if that helps but if not I guess it was a lot of wasted money. I wish I had not bought these.
Requested to return item.
"These shoes are really cute, the purple is nice.  They arrived well packaged, quickly, but they are tiny.  They run short, narrow, and my feet are just feet.  Have to return them and go along with I don't have Merrell feet."
They don't stay on your ears. Will be returning them.
Fake Picture and the build is really flimsy. Too expensive for the type of plastic. The only reason I gave one star is there is no choice to give no star at all. Don't waste your money buying this.
The anklets I ordered came to me broken and missing parts.
Nothing was the same size
I lost my charm the first day I had it on my keychain. Got them for an out of state friend and I. Disappointed in the quality. Cute though.
I ordered the wide and was very excited to receive such a versatile shoe.  Imagine my disappointment when the shoes were just way too tight through the toe box.  I will be returning these shoes.
"This money clip is nice looking however it doesn't hold much. My husband likes to hold money and credit cards. If you only have a couple cards and little cash, this might be okay but if you carry several cards and a lot of cash, this isn't the money clip for you."
"Decent but not great. Bought these for my 3 year old, who is large for his size. The seams began to rip after one wash."
broke it was so thin my fault
Disappointing. The tail part fell off and got lost the first time my daughter wore it. I wouldn't buy it again.
Green looks much lighter than pictured. Dress looks very cheap and flimsy.
"Too small, I was only able to wrap the scarf once around my neck, would not buy again."
"Got this for a gift for my sister and it was wayyy to small on her, it was sad because the shoes look great but don't fit her at all"
"I have these two stars because the color is nice. But that's about it.  They fit horribly. The leggings are loose at the bottom and fit weird in the waist. I washed them hoping they would shrink a little, but now they're short and loose."
"Not as comfortable around the neck and shoulder area. The fabric is cut in 90* angle, it's pooling down, and makes very uncomfortable to were, I have to lift the shoulder parts up every so often because of the pooling and acquired starching of the fabric.
I wish I could return it, but I didn't try until it was too late to return."
"The fabric is definitely different than I expected,  It is stretchy. It is somewhat see through. It is too long for knee length for me and I don't know how to hem this fabric. I would have returned it but it came from Israel and I didn't know what to expect with shipping. I will decide what to do with it next summer. It could be just what someone else is looking for. Just not me. It did arrive quickly and intact."
"Cute as all getout, but too small. I wear a 10 and had to return for an 11. The eleven fit but a 10.5 would've been perfect. Sizing aside, the shoe, when you can find your size, is very comfortable and looks so good!"
very thin and cheaply made
I wear a size 44DD in bra but my waist is a 28 inch and this was way to small! And broke quickly o well it was cheap anyway
"I ordered this for my daughter for Christmas, but I'm sending it back and getting a different one.  It's pretty enough, but the ""jewels"" are cheap looking flat-back pins that have hot glue covered in glitter on them.  The dress laces up in the back (so no independence when getting this dress on).  And, the deciding factor: it has really stiff netting inside.  There's a layer of satiny material closest to the legs, but not enough, so I'm SURE I'd be hearing about how itchy it is.  The dress is pretty, but not pretty enough to cover the defects and the price."
It won't even twist on came too my door twisted off and broke!
"The tag inside said XXX, the hang tag said USA size large."
Poor quality product...very hard for small babies
they fell apart allreaddy only 3 times anywere else would refund my MONEY now i hope u do
a very low-quality material that looks terrible in person...I bought it to wear to a wedding and laughed at how ugly it was when I received it...went to Nordstroms the same day and bought a silk bow-tie there and received a ton of compliments on how great it looked...meanwhile this joke sits unused...
"I was really excited when this came. It's beautiful and exactly what I wanted when I ordered it. However, when I tried to set it, I couldn't turn the dial past a certain point. Plus it was EXTREMELY hard to get the back cover off to replace the battery."
Like the look of it but it scratches really easy unlike other titanium rings
The size seems to be a really small fit for age.
"I don't like the way the sweatshirt fits. It's short, doesn't hit the hips. It's also very boxy. If you are into this type of fit, ordering your normal size should be fine."
"these shoes seem to run in oriental metrics, when you order for U.S. size people it is narrow even in Sperry made product. My experience with Dockers,Isotoner and other brands is the difference in fit when you order the exact same product. I have several pair of Isotoners I ordered from amazon, some Dockers but this is my first Sperry shoes."
The sizes are small ladies sizes not womens
"they are durable and of good quality but heavier and stiffer than any other new balance I've ever owned and I love new balance... if you are looking for longevity out of them and don't plan to do much running then they might be what you are looking for, but I often go running and wear low/cut socks and due to the weight and design I have gotten blisters on both my feet and Achilles. New Balance makes a ton of great products, just that this one wasn't for me."
"Runs small, stinks.  Literally, smells bad.  Not sure if it will shrink even washed in cold water.  Was LATE in arrival."
One earring was broken when it arrived.  Not pleased w/ quality.
"Same pants in white and l. Blue fit fine after cut your own button hole on all them. Brown pair is not able button and same size, style, name as other pairs"
The zipper broke off
Returned  size 10 too small + narrow cut.
"I really wanted to love this top. The material seemed nice and flowy, not to heavy not too thin, the color was lovely- HOWEVER, I decided to wash the top before I wore it, as I would any top. Put it in on gentle/handwash cycle, with like colors and hung to dry. After drying, it was covered with what looked like oily spots. None of the other items I washed had these spots. I thought perhaps my detergent/softener didn't rinse out properly, so I spot treated the areas and manually hand washed it again, with a mild detergent and no softener, and hung to dry. Once dry, it had the spots again! New ones, and in different areas. I gave it once last try, washing on gentle with Woolite, alone. More spots. Needless to say, it was a wasted purchase and I won't be wearing and cannot return it, because it's been washed 3 times. I gave it two stars because it WAS pretty, right out of the package and WOULD HAVE fit beautifully. I won't order another."
"Can we say super-duper SMALL?!  I can get it on, but to wear this underneath something else that may be form fitting would be insane as it does not add a flattering appeal nor does it truly ""slim"" or ""shape"".  Money waisted in my opinion."
"Too tight, too short. It's typical with clothes now that are made anywhere but the US"
"Fit fine. Material a little cheaper than expected. Lapel doesn't lay down as nicely as I would have liked, even after pressing"
"looks super cute, but is super small even for a average size newborn."
Chest area is too small if you wear a 38DD. I purchased a 2x
"This top runs very small. I'm normally a large in tops, but this is cut extremely narrow. If you have a large-ish chest size way up or look elsewhere.
Not a fan of the material either. It feels a little cheap."
Beautiful bag. Unfortunately it arrived with scratches all over it. Looks like it had been returned and the seller tried to pawn it off on the next customer.
"Actual color is mustard, not yellow."
"Like the design , if IOU set the time ones I if vice don't change it as it will break , was great for 5 month ..."
"This hat is not like the one pictured. Just like all of the other reviews said it is a cheaper design then what is pictured. They show a small rose with a raised embroidery rose that has a black outline. The hat I received has a flat embroidery rose and is only partly outlined. I think the rose is larger then what is pictured as well. It looks much cheaper and not as nice. My daughter wanted it and was hoping she would get the one pictured. The hat itself is nice, it's made of 100% acrylic and has a Velcro closure. She's keeping it and will wear it."
"This swimsuit is super cute; I like the pattern, but I was disappointed when I tried it on. The shorts were a perfect fit but the top was larger than expected. The tank top is clearly made for a bustier woman. I have an average body and wear a ""B"" cup. Don't expect the cups to fit unless you're at least a ""D""."
Horrible quality shirt used. Feels terrible in skin despite the fact it is actually cotton. Very stiff and scratchy. Beware. The graphics are very faded too-
"I ordered one more size thinking it would be large enough to fit over layers of clothing... It di ot fit even worn alone! The quality of the material is ok but the finih is not polished... It makes this coat look ""cheap"" and the color is somewhat faded... Not a bright red. Will not wear it."
"Great shoe for our rough wearing 8 year old.  He has been through nike's and adidas in 6 weeks.  These have held up much better.  Still look great after over a month of summer wear.

UPDATE!!! - 2 Months after purchase.  Shoe has pretty much fallen apart.  The drawstrings have snapped.  The inside sole has wore through.  and the outside mesh has ripped.  Disappointed in Merrell on these.  I thought these were going to be the ones.

Maybe they could work better for your kiddo."
"These are very 'short wasted'. The elastic has very little stretch.  The opening in the 'fly' is so short, I have the idea that whoever designed them thinks my 'member' and my 'belly button' are in the same area.
Not delivered as described------I wanted just regular rise waist not something so skimpy.
Will send them to our local charity and guess I will have to go to Walmart to find what I want."
"Aside from fitting poorly, it was not the color that I ordered.

While I ordered a dark blue, what arrived was more of a turquoise blue (cerulean). Nor was the brand the same as what was pictures."
"Has about a 3 inch inseam. If you want to cover more than your balls, these are not what you are looking for. The hand (feel) seems fairly good. The waist seems weak and I doubt they will last very long in that respect. I am a big guy and when I sit down they are about half way my ass. Hanes brand does not seem to do this. Just thought I would give these a try since they were a little cheaper. I am pretty disappointed
."
"Runs smaller than usual. Photo shows a print; I received a solid. I did not return because they did fit, just not usual M.  They have lightweight, which I love, and cool for summer nights."
Expected an assortment of green underwear. I received red and blue. That is very dissapointing to me as my son only likes green. I do not recommend as they did not give a choice as what color you could buy and that leaves you to assume you are going to receive the item color in the picture. I will not buy again. The size fits as expected.
"Crown design flaws in the pocket to take the phone will often be pulled out, resulting in the watch to stop running. I do not know why I got the watch, the watch has been running, and did not take the protection mode does not run. Do not know how long this watch can be used, and now do not intend to return the. Because I want to know how long it will be?"
Worst thing I've ever ordered online.  Top was huge and misshapen and the bottoms were made for a toddler.
not good support because the base that support the sole of the foot is too narrow
Thin material and bad fit.
"I purchased these shoes, because I have actually been using a much earlier version of this shoe to run in. I ordered half a size up from my older version, so I would have more room for socks during the colder temperatures. With these being the new ""relaxed"" fit, I found my foot was slipping around too much. I am also not at all a fan of the memory foam. The way I am as a runner, I need to reduce my foot motion. Memory foam and ""spongy"" or ""cushioned"" shoes do not do well for me. They are great for walking around in, though that really wasn't the intended purchase of these shoes for me. I could see where you could easily turn an ankle in these, as the area around the ankles is extremely loose, with tons of give. It all depends on what you are looking for, but this shoe really did not work well for what I was looking for."
"I am a size 8 to 10 and ordered a 12/14 so I would be comfortable. I could barely close the back, the top looked like scales and three weeks later I am still  picking up glitter all over the house. Just a weird fit, made me look shapeless."
"The material is much thinner. In the picture the bottom hem looks slightly ruffled it is not it is just edged with a stitch. The top part in the picture looked ruffled, the garment at the top part is lace. The 3 dangling strips look stupid, but can be trimmed short with out damaging the stitching if your careful. Well a thong does not have much to is as is the one that comes with it though has a tiny tiny triangle of fabric. The garment may hold up for a few wears, and careful washing's."
Returning them. The first time I wore them the post bent away from the crystal.
"I returned it as soon as I received it. The material is extremely cheap look, I think this is you and not leather. The handle and some of the smaller components like the strap appear to be genuine cowhide, but shell of the bag itself don't have the  characteristics of genuine leather. He is trying to snag and break off. Do not buy this."
"Prettier in the picture. The size fits as expected. Very hard, not very comfortable to wear even though they have a low heal. I couldn't WAIT to get them off and will probably never wear them again."
Had to return. Pretty watch but came in with a dead battery
the button cannot be hooked properly
"Have worn a couple times, not really happy keep hoping they will stretch in calf area but they are pleather. They are comfortable in foot area, so if you have skinny calf go for it. Otherwise cute for under jeans or pants look cheap to wear for skirt should make in leather."
"So far so good!  Very comfortable and half the price of other sandals I have purchased.  I will see how they hold up and post an update later on...
Review Update:  I purchased these sandals the beginning of August and initially loved them.  Very comfortable and held up well to almost daily use.  After about 8 weeks of use all of a sudden one area on the side of the shoe where the side of your heal is just came out of the rubber insole.  The glue just gave it up.  I read some reviews of this happening and hoped it wouldn't be the case, but it was...  Very disappointing because of how comfortable they are.  Wont be purchasing again...

***Update 12/2/16*** After contacting both the seller and Amazon regarding the side of the shoe coming unglued from the sole, neither was able to do anything because it was past the 30 day return limit.  I decided to contact the manufacturer's customer service by email and explain to them what happened.  I received a reply within 48 apologizing for what happened and offering to replace the sandals at no cost to me.  They asked for a couple of pictures and gave me a few options on replacement sandals.  I chose a different style and color and they were shipped out today.  The whole process took about a week.  Northside has wonderful customer service!!! I'm just waiting for my new, all expense paid sandals to arrive."
"They arrived quickly and they fit. And they even look cute, but these are soooooo flimsy. Will prob only last a couple weeks."
"My wife wears a size 7 1/2 shoe and she has many other foot jewelry. The indicated size stating 7 to 8 is wrong, the item sent would fit perhaps a size 9 to 10."
"The look is not good and they are too loosy between the calf and the foot. Beside, too tight for my leg."
"After reading the rave reviews of the ExOfficio Give-N-Go both here and on travel gear sites, I was underwhelmed by the product after trying it out for a few days.

The biggest issue with the Give-N-Go is that they do not really fit like boxer briefs should. I ordered both a large and a medium, and the large was almost comically loose both in the ""central area"" and around the legs. While I wear a large in everything else, I had to stick with the medium, and even then they are still loose and lacking much support. I believe it is the cut, not the sizing, that's causing this issue. Moreover, there appears to be too much extra fabric in back, which creates problems of its own that I am sure you can imagine. It is also important to point out that the fabric is not smooth, but rather ""waffled"" to an extent. There is one area in which the Give-N-Go excels, however, and that is durability and anti-microbial / odor properties.

If you're looking for a great non-cotton, travel ready boxer-brief, I'd recommend instead the Airism or Airism mesh series from Uniqlo. They accomplish the same thing, but fit like a dream, feel like silk and give you that ever-sought-after ""feels like I'm wearing nothing"" feeling."
A. flimsey shoe. compared to same type Easy Spirit I purchased two years ago.  I returned them.  A person without foot problems could wear them.
"They look practical, as practical as heels can be. But they are cheaply made and have zero cushioning."
"I bought this for myself being an Amazonian, but the fit is ridiculously small.  Its so small that my wife wears it as a cozy around the house kind of shirt."
Cup size was small.
extremely narrow
"The bottoms fit great but the top was poorly made. The top fit but gave me underboob because there is not elastic band in the bottom of the top piece.

Sad because I love the look of this swimsuit, going to return it."
"Look cuter in the picture...material not good quality.  I bought this cheap and still didn;t keep.  Cut is ok, but I can't believe anyone would happily pay the origianl asking price.  Just blue and white stripes and not even a pretty blue.  Returned it."
"Decent, but fabric isn't very comfortable and the fit is unusual.  I would not buy again."
Long right. Too heavy for the chain
"I wear a size 15 shoe.  It's hard to find a ""dress sock"" that fits.  I ordered the 2XL size (which supposedly fits my shoe size), hoping that they would fit.  It was so tight around my calf that I would never want to wear this sock.  Waste of money."
"My son loved the design of this bookbag. Unfortunately,  the strap has started to rip off after 1 month of use!  I have sewed it , I hope it will last him the school year!"
THE DECORATION CAME OFF IN A FEW DAYS OF WEARING IT
Don't fit
"I live in my Reefs. I've been buying Reefs for over 20 years now. I really wanted to love these and I do like the color and they are cushy. But they don't fit. You need to have long, very skinny feet to wear these comfortably."
"I had to return they run small,I returned them"
Love the product but so much for the plastic latches.  Mine broke within a month and try to find them on the internet to get yours replaced under the lifetime warranty
"This ring was slightly loose on me, thin but attractive until the ring seam popped and the ring flew off out my car window. Needless to say I will never buy a ring from this maker again. Waste of money!"
These did not fit very well and were not at stretchy as you would like. The fabric was really cheap and kind of shiny and the stitching was very scratchy. The worst part was as soon as I put them on they started frying and falling apart. I returned them. Oh and also VERY see through.
This sucks
I wear another pair of Clarks Mary Jane Flats so I thought the fit would be the same; it wasn't. It was way too tight around the front of the shoe. I returned it and ordered a size 9 C/D but was sent a size 6 so I returned that item as well. Evidently the gray does not come in the size I wanted. I'll keep looking.
tarnished in days
They look really cheap and are not true to size.
"These slippers had 2 problems, one had a cut in the toe about and inch long and all the way through, the other had a piece of hard plastic embedded in it that pointed inside so it poked your foot.  Quality control was sleepin."
Way to small. Got a 2xl so I knew it would fit and it's more like a medium
I ordered ONE of these as a stocking stuffer and the seller took it upon himself to charge me for THREE..I certainly have no use for THREE of these cheapie little pieces of plastic! They're like something out of the Dollar Store!
The fabric was very thin. You get what you paid for.
Cheap and has flaws all over fabric. :(
"REturning this.  I had purchased several fine knitted scarfs of this style in stores... and thought that is what this would be.  No way.  it is a fairly inexpensive rayon type material, and just looks cheaply made to me.  Also far more HOT pink that deep pink!"
For some reason they fit small been wearing timberland pro titan boots for 6years always wear 9m?
"The size S/M is more like an XL. Disappointed, but it is comfortable."
SUPER stiff and uncomfortable.
Bracelet broke the first day! And the color came a pale pastel pink instead of the happy vibrant pink pictured.
"I did not return this because it took wearing to determine that it was terrible.  If you want to appear flat-chested and appear to have NO breasts, except under your arms, this is the one for you!  No support at all.  The only positive is that you can squash yourself from the front."
"I love Nine West, and I know to order 1/2 a size up with more narrow heels.  Which I did, however this shoe is tighter and more narrow than any of my other heels.  My feet are killing me after an hour in them.
I used to have the Ambitious Synthetic pumps, which were super comfortable, but I can't find them anymore.  This was not a good replacement."
Not what I was expecting. Material is not cotton. Will be returning. No stars.
different picture than what i got. i would have worn them but they were too small. i gave them away
"I hoped this robe would fit the way it fits the model in the photo. I dislike short robes that are super short. This one was significantly shorter than shown. It did not reach mid-thigh. I am not overly tall (5'6), so I was disappointed in the length. I really wanted to like it because it is very soft and I liked the furry hood, but ultimately I kept it in my closet for several months and donated it to Goodwill. It might be helpful if their size charts included length."
Very cheesy.  Not good for much but cosplay.
"The chain on the charm band broke the second day, and the straps on the watch broke day 3. I am very disappointed. With all the similar styles of this type of watch, I chose this one- and I chose wrong. I love the look, and the style- but poor craftmanship forces me to give this product the lowest rating."
The seperations in the feather are sharp. The shape of the ring is awkward because the backside  is at a point so it doesn't lay right on your finger.
"I normally wear a size 8 shoe, but I had trouble getting my foot into this boot and that process made my toes, feet, and calves cramp mercilessly."
"Can't wear it, is not a XXL,  waste of time and money."
"These are cute slippers but they did not last long. My kid wears this inside the house but he's active, it only took a few weeks and these started to wear off and tear at the toes section. Didn't even last us two months. I threw it away and got something with a thicker sole."
"These pants in white denim are a complete let-down. Trust me and do not by them until they have corrected the style. The problem is the front pockets.  They are somehow connected to each other and the fake zipper area with the white pocket material across your abdomen which is completely see-through through the white denim. See photo, look carefully. When will these designers realize that pockets need to be nude fabric? If it were just the individual pockets this style might be OK, but the way the pockets are connected to each other in the front is just plain weird. It is too bad because they fit great. They were a little tough to get all the way up (and were way more tight in the waist than the size 4 I received in Hazelnut) but once I got them up they felt great and gave such a nice smooth silhouette. No muffin top. The only way these can be worn without looking ridiculous is with long tunic style tops that cover the entire pocket area.  At this price point you can do better."
Very hard to open & close.
"Didn't like at all,seams on toe too thick."
The quality of the dress is nice but I am disappointed because of the time spent in ensuring the correct measurement was taken yet it was still too small.
When I got this product their was a horrible smell it stunk sooooo badly I definitely wouldn't recommend anyone buying this
"This is a bathing suit, not a sports bra as described. It offers no support. Granted, I have a 42DDD sized bust, and I was looking for something that I can run, dance, work out in that offers my full support and zero bounce. This was NOT the right bra for me. It would probably be fine for someone with small breasts who doesn't need a lot of support. I found the fabric was more conducive for swim wear than work out wear also. Its cute, but it doesn't serve the purpose I need. I am returning it for a refund.
Buyer beware: this seller was very unhappy with the honest review I provided and narrated me on multiple occasions to change or delete it. I will not be purchasing anything from them in the future due to the unprofessional nature of their contact."
"Day 3 of use and already have a hole near the top drawstring...like the old adage goes  ""you get what you pay for"""
Shoes aren't comfortable on my feet - too tight. Not enough support. Seem to have be made with cheap materials. Not Merrell's usual high standards.
Not plated 100 % with gold.
This watch is mainly for fashion. It's attractive and fashionable. But if you are an active person. Please don't buy it. Its incredibly fragile watch. It literally cannot hold its breath under water. Big let down. The only plus about this watch was the band for which I use with another watch.
Does not fit the gear 2 watch as described :( waste of money
"If I could rate a product no starts I would this product.  I was shocked when I pulled it out of the bag.  It looked like it was made for a little girl, not an adult.  I real waste of my time."
"Idea is great and might work for some, but not for a 34D. It held nothing in place because the fit was completely off."
Nice if you like junk
"it is not good at all , it isn't look like the pic like slim fit"
"Came shipped with two dents in the frame, shipping box was fine. I returned it without replacement because I felt that this portended future issues, given the roughness of airline luggage handlers. Product was truly ""lightweight"" and felt fragile.  Desired for international travel.  Opted for a travelpro bag and have been very satisfied."
"Ordered 6 pairs of these lounge pants advertised as mens XL.  These pants came marked XL, but in reality the size was small at best.  Iten was returned as not what was advertised."
"Cheap plastic. One of the lights had come off during shipping and now barely hangs on. Inside the light's case, the battery clip to hold the battery broke. Had to use tape to fix that and then more tape to hold the light assembly onto the helmet.

A cheap product. Unfortunately, the only one of its kinds I could find. Got lots of attention though for my son on Halloween."
"I am unhappy Cinderella!... I did not order these boats! I order 8.5 and W8 9.5 come in mail. Cute shoes They are a lot like my old worn out Keens that need glue and duck tape..... I hope they can create a shoe app that could correspond with what we try to order...oh butt to error is human! Try again I need to replace my Keen Newport H2s purchased in 2005 and my Slippers ""those sleeping bags for your feet"" wore out the BACKs! Just turned them baby's into slides. And my leather slip-ons I guess there not in production any more, which these boats were my replacements. I guess I'm joining the ""Got the wrong size club""  hey smack you on YOUR Amazon! Whoopaa...Try again and get my 8.5 size I be ordering a boat load of shoes. NOT big boats. Two STARS because... You can only make ONE! First impression. Pshhhh"
These were very thin.  They were very wide at the top as well.
"Looks terrible.  Cheap, and extremely thin material.  It is not Polo by Ralph Lauren.  It's attempting to be similar though."
"The design is a parakeets, the fabric is chiffon."
This robe is soft and plush.  My son was so excited to wear it!  After one week the shoulder seam ripped. My son is petite so this should never have happened.  Pretty disappointed considering the cost.
"Look great, but faux suede rubbed off after first wear....& then they looked awful..."
this runs REALLY small
"I was disappointed with these sandals and sent them back.  I've bought many Clark products, and they usually fit well and provide good support/ These were poor fitting with wide heel ends, although not marked or boxed as large."
"too small, its fitted for the folk who makes it"
"sizes are inconsistent, company charges for returns"
My daughter bought these for a dance recital and they started peeling in big flakes in the crotch area after she had them on for about 10 mins. She is a little bitty thing so thigh friction is definitely the cause.  :( We loved the look but was horribly disappointed they didn't even last ONE night :( #tears maybe we just go a bad egg?
I wish there was a way to select only one color.  I really wanted just grey and black.  I got lime green.  Sorry I am just not a lime green person.  I returned them and did not even open the package.
Literally falling apart straight out the bag. Such poor quality. I wanted to put it on a designer handbag but it looks to awful to do so. I literally gave it to my cat to kick around for a few days. I should have returned it for my money back
"I have had great bras from Chantelle in the past, in the same size as this one. However, this one run a lot smaller, and was more flimsy, not the quality expected, nor the fit or size."
"Not a big fan of white socks or fruit of the loom anymore,but they worked,but wear out quickly"
rough fabric and tight fit
"These look fine, but they are stretch material, and small at that.  Would not buy again."
These are rediculoulsly tiny
ok not what I expected
It's perfect for us! It did start falling apart before the end of the year.
"Meh, more like a mumu."
Not a good slide. My sons foot just pushed out of the top. No matter how tight we make the Velcro. Don't waste your money.
Looks very cheap. Returning.
"Forget it, go for Clarks."
Great fabric but size about what would fit a 20 year old girl
I should have read the description better. I saw a review that said it would cover your whole back! Well yess it would if you were 10 years old! It must be a child's backpack. I couldn't even put it on much less think of it covering my entire back. Good thing it was so cheap. I gave it to my friends 6 year old....I gotta learn to read.
"I needed longer laces.  The 59"" laces were two eyelets short of what I would have desired.  I needed laces to cover
eight eyelets."
Very cheap looking. Looks like it would fall apart very easy.
Definitely WAY TOO small! In length and width!! I wanted to return them but I waited too long.
Turned in 2 weeks...sucks
This purse was larger than I hoped for and it was a hard leather and not soft. I prefer a softer leather.
This bracelet is cute but it is child's size. It was quite a disappointment to open and realize it was very small. I wish they had different sizes to pick from.
"These are heavy-ish. Does not look like they picture. Clips are not sturdy and the crystal is very dark, not rose gold at all. Seems more brown."
The sizes ordered wasn't what I received. I ordered a 7.5 in women's and received a 7.5 in means and a 9.5 in women's. Is it possible to send them back for a correct size?
"Shirts are NOT like they say.
I ordered 2 shirts xtra small . One burgundy and the other beige . I got a yellow and red one, not what I asked for at all. They don't even have the cute ruffle on the bottom like the pictures.  I've got shirts from here before I'm very disappointed
Do these shirts look like extra small or the colors I asked for? NO they are not!"
"Ordered the my size and when I got these they said ""one size"" on the tag. Why give me a size option if its one size fits all? Very unhappy."
"I have a small torso, am 34 A, normally wear an XS or a size 0. I didn't really like how this fit my chest - I felt like it wasn't tight enough or that my cups didn't fill it out enough. I ordered a size S/M, and heard from other reviewers with similar sizing to me that they loved and it fit great; wasn't the case for me. I also felt like the strip running from the chest to the bikini area was too loose. If you're a B cup, and maybe have a more normal-length torso or longer, you'll fit this perfectly. It's very pretty lace, and everything is sewn on securely - looks like high-quality lingerie. But for really tiny ladies... look for something else.

As a side note, I ordered the product pictured (the mainly-red lace with black accents) - and they sent me the other one (the black lace with very small red accents). When it came it did not look as pictured. Maybe the red lace would have fit a little differently... not sure.

**P.S. I called Amazon about it and they were super good at taking care of me. Thanks Amazon for great customer service!!"
It didn't have a long enough torso.
Ordered an 8 but it fit like a 6.  The pant I bought in the store fit perfect.  I ordered the same brand and size and it was WAY too small.  Very disappointed.  Colors are limited in the stores so I had high hopes for online. Very disappointed.
Product was not true to size and seemed different than similar items purchased in the past. My daughter was unable to wear them and I had to go out and buy some from old navy.
Great belt but Velcro is weak and has ripped already.
Kind of flimsy.
I really liked them before I washed one. The seaming came out in the wash the very first time and it pretty much fell apart.
The pair of socks was twenty dollars - I expected that these would be very comfortable hiking socks but I was disappointed.  They are the correct size and fit but they bunch in my hiking shoes and the padding all seems to be in the wrong place.  They make my feet very uncomfortable and would cause real damage if used on a hiking trip.
This is not for a child. It was too large for my head. It is not made very well. The front that lights up just fell right off. Could not be used. Do not recommend.
the analog wasn't working when I received it.
did not look good. Hung like a sheet. buttons didn't stay close. cheaply made. Returned it.
Sized for a woman. I ordered an XL and could not get my arms in the sleeves.
It should have been big based on their sizing chart---it was not
"Beautiful color (olive) but the material is extremely thin. If you're a plus size girl like I am it will not do you any favors. Looks stunning when standing still but as soon as you start to move around, unless your legs are completely smooth and perfect, anything you want to hide will be on full display. Will be returning. Very disappointed as the pants are extremely comfortable."
After weeks of waiting the dress I received was too small. I ordered a six year old size dress and received a one year old dress. I also had to file a claim in order to get my money back. Would not recommend anyone takes the risk here!
POOR QIALITY MATERIAL
I ended up returning this. I didn't like the material and it looked very cheap. I ended up returning it. I suppose it would have made a good beach bag.
These run way too big. I am a size 8 and the 8s fit like a 9. Order at lease one size down.
Sole is crap in freezing weather...cracks at seams.
Poor material
These are bit snug at the calf....especially for chunkier babies ;)
Very tight fit. Returning them at the time of this review.
This design is very narrow and short compared to the other volatile sandal.  I do not recommend this style if you have a wide foot.
Dont know yet.... only tried them on.  shopping on sucks when shopping for shoes. hard to find that one.  too costly trying. second one i bought in vain
Don't waste your time on this shoe. After only 7 miles it caused under my toe nails on the big toes to turn purple! PAINFUL! I should have read the other reviews. The concept is really good and other than that (I am going to lose the nails for sure) I would have kept them. I hope their money back guarantee is good. So far have been on hold for 45 minutes.......  :-(
Too tight.  I was trying to order the right size by using the chart size and reading posts but it still didn't help me find my correct size. So I returned it.
"Cheaply made, string coming undone, awkward fit all around."
"Terrible design.  The shoe is a slipper with one piece body instead of opening for foot with a tongue under laces.  I have high insteps and they were nearly impossible to get on my feet, even with my dress shoe-horn.  Right shoe finally on and feels fine, looks great. Left shoe won't go on at all. (not such a great look anymore)"
"These were painful right out of the box. I exchanged for a larger size thinking perhaps they'd be more comfortable, to no avail. My toes were smashed together and the top flap cut into the front of my ankle. These are cute af, but not for my piddies."
It's not black and gold. It's black and yellow. Looks like a bumble bee. Plan to return. Did not wear.
these straps are a serious pain in the ass and the material is so loose it doesn't hold your boobs at all
I received my scrubs and noticed they are med.i order large..I needed them asap.and now I have to send these back.
Asics is my preferred athletic shoe but this is a different animal.  The shoe is very stiff with a very narrow toe box.  The support was ok but it was so stiff your foot is pushed to conform to the shoe. I can't imagine walking for 18 holes in this shoe.
The purple dress fell apart pretty quickly at the seam where the top meets the bottom. Now I'm being forced by a toddler to get my sewing machine out to fix it because she wants to still wear it.
These were marked XXL when in fact were XL. It took two emails and two phone calls to get a return merchandise label. Refund requested. Quality wasn't good. Would not buy these again.
"Way too small for my 7 year old, and he's a small guy."
I wear a medium in Victoria Secret's underwear; ordered an XL and they're still too small. Wore once and threw away--wasn't worth my time to return. Don't recommend.
Sadly I had to send these back...they were way smaller than expected...I had to pay for the shipping back so ended up being out a lot of money
"Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews. I bought it as an ""add on"" item since I needed just a few more dollars to qualify for free shipping and I was going to attend a private screening of the new Star Wars movie. Needless to say, I was very disappointed in this purchased. You can barely see the light if it comes on at all. At best, it's just a piece of costume decoration. Don't buy this for a child. They won't like it. Very cheaply made. Would have given it a zero or less star."
"I was very disappointed with the quality of the fabric with this product.  The logo looked good, but the fabric is very rough and if you hold it up to the light it almost has a qauze like quality to it.  I had purchased as an Xmas  gift for someone and since the T-shirt arrived on Dec. 24th, I had no time to get something else.  I was embarrassed when they opened the gift and saw the poor quality.  Don't waste your money.  I wish I hadn't."
"Both of our girls (ages 2 and 5) received one of these dresses each as a gift.  They were both so thrilled until my 5 year old tried it on and it was WAY too small.  Hers had to be returned.  The dress is one size and seems to be about a 3T, maybe a 4T.  My 2 year old wears 3T and it fits her nicely.  Here are the pros and cons:

Pros:
The removable skirt is great since it DOES fit my 5 year old so they can share the one dress (since it's really a dress with a detachable skirt)

Cons:
Runs small and only comes in the one size.
Quality is horrible.  We've had it a month and it's already fraying.
The dress when worn alone without the detachable shirt is VERY short (mini skirt length!)
And my biggest complaint, which is my I'm writing this review, is the plastic brooch sewn onto the neckline is a STICKER on plastic.  Since it is sewn onto the dress, it is not removable.  I had not noticed this was just a sticker of Sophia (instead of it being screen printed onto the plastic brooch as one should expect) until I was pulling it out of the wash machine and saw the sticker had peeled off into tiny little balls and my 2 year old gasped.  How gross that I can't wash this without it being ruined further!  All because they were cutting corners by using a sticker on a piece that is sewn on!  Urgh."
The hat didn't even survive the mail. It was broken when I got. The top of the hat broke off from the base.  Doesnt even deserve a star
Not suitable for a woman.
"I wore these only in the house, and the sole cracked in half after two months.  Not worth the money."
"Fits like an irregular shirt, material keeps twisting around waist. Image is not centered on shirt. Made in Mexico by Tultex. Very thin material, 100% cotton. Fits a little small, best to order one size up."
"So, so pretty. But not comfortable. I even ordered a half size up from what I normally wear, and should have ordered full size up. But there's no arch support. If that's essential for you, look elsewhere. But damn, they are cute."
"I have to send these back!!  They are at least one size too small. They look like women's size 10.5, not men's."
Shoe Runs Large.  Returned.
"This fits if you have no breasts. If you have something under your shirt, no matter the size, then don't get this bra.  There is WAY too much padding that it pushes you completely out of the bra and doesn't support you whatsoever. On top of that, mine came in a squashed package and the bra is permanently out of shape because of it.  Waste of money."
This shoe fits narrow. Worst shoe I have ever had for a medium width.  Bought a pair of GoLite  and they are a perfect fit.
"Does OK but didn't clean copper very well , not overly impressed with the product ."
"The picture makes it look very soft and feminine, but the color is really bright!  I ended up returning it since it was more like neon pink."
Returned this item because it wasn't a beanie type hat. It stood straight up.
It's a bit on a hard side and the molding is not what I expected
"Beautiful boot....except on the back of the boot, there is a small square piece of hardware. Looks pretty but digs into the back of your calf...ouch!
Sending back today."
"I wear size small, bought a large, while I like the look of the shirt, is doesn't fit properly around the arms. One shoulder is wider than the other. Where the sleeves meet the shoulder is just to narrow. The area just above the bust and around the underarms are too tight. Thread hangs from everywhere, It is poorly tailored. The style is nice but whoever made this shirt just cannot sew."
"I used the guideline of purchasing two sizes larger than I normally would and found that gave me the size I expected. However, the fit was not as tailored as the pictures of the item led me to believe. The shirt was wider at the bottom and billowed out a bit, which was not what I hoped for. The material seemed to be decent quality but was not very soft."
shoes came defective with marks and fit was extremely tight. Right foot was too tight.
"this was a poorly made sandal, the toes are too long. the ankle part is too small for me."
"Zipper broke today, the first time I tried to use the wallet.  While on holiday in Japan.  Worse than useless, this thing is now going to cause me problems on the rest of my trip.  Avoid."
Small triangular pads fall out. Reducing garmets usefulness
"No fly.  What? Fail.  These are supposed to be men's underwear.  Guess not. Having to undo britches like a little boy to take a whiz is ridiculous.  I bought these mostly to try out the material, so picked the less expensive version, but even the Walmart Fruit of the Looms have flies in them."
"These are horrible and worth more like $5 than the $20 I paid. Far too long, misshapen, and absurdly see through thin. Very low quality, worse than dollar store pajamas."
"Wayyyyyy too humongous, and not as good materials as some other water shoes out there. Also, these are not comfortable to walk on. I eventually went with rocsoc"
Horrible fit it's just way too small and I ordered the largest size. And I only weigh 220 lb. But they're really cute lightweight I wish it fit properly.
I just need to lose a lot of weight.
I work construction so I wear heavy duty boots for about 12 hours a day and with that being said I need heavy duty laces. I bought these because my nylon strings break about every month or two so I ran across these on Amazon and they say they will never break so of course that got my attention and I bought 2 pair at $20 a pair. I have to say lacing them up for the first time felt great because I was able to pull them super tight and it felt great for the first month or two but then one day I was lacing them up and the black sheath came off about 18 inches of it so now I had black and white shoe laces that I couldn't keep tied which was aggravating. I took the other ones I bought and after a month or two the same thing happened . Long story short is they will break and they will burn and you most definitely can cut them. Overpriced laces.
"I run about 4 to 5 days a week, 3 to 4 miles. I noticed that by mile 2, my feet are significantly sweatier in these socks than my other athletic socks. I really wanted to love these socks because I loved the style and colors that come in the pack but I won't be reaching for these anymore."
This product runs ridiculous small
"Horrible product! Very cheap made. The information stated that it included the headband and braids,but there were no braids at all. I also hate false advertising.

[...]"
Sticky and pilling. Very polyester feeling.
Pin is nice quality. The pin backs are crap . They don't stay on . Im going to have get a different back or tape them on
Sorry is my mistak
they did not screw on straight.  And if you left them loser to be straight then they fell off. And  very difficult to clean!
"The dimensions of these shoes seemed right for the size, but they still somehow didn't fit - they were oddly too small and too large at the same time. The toe box felt smooshed while there was room in the back of the heel. I think it's because the insole is so slick and slippery that my feet slid right down as if on a slide. The ""floor"" of the shoe is very firm with very little support. Adding an insole with padding and friction might have helped, but I found the shoes so uncomfortable that I just returned them. Too bad, because the ""look"" is very cute and unique."
"No back support, was not comfortable. I would opt for the warner's wire free bra instead. Dissappointed"
"Unfortunately it is quite narrow in the shoulders, narrow enough to have to send back.  The material is very nice and does wrinkle easily, had it laying on my dresser before trying it on again and deciding I couldn't live with it. What a shame, I love Mordenmiss.
Note: narrow shoulders are a big problem Im running into a lot lately with Chinese cooler weather clothes."
The white shirt is see-through. Was hoping it wasn't but it is.. have to return it
"These are so stylish - just wish they were made according to size!  I wear a 12M and I'm not sure this style would fit a 10M. With a size 12, nowhere to go up so I had to sadly return them."
"I am LE. This product was extremely uncomfortable. I wore it for about two months. I tried various positions and tension. It left significant bruises on my hips and was painful to wear during shift. Initially, I thought I would get used to the discomfort but the pain never subsided. I had to go back to shirt stays."
"I waited weeks for this s*** only to be disappointed, I am a little curvy but have tried the same size of leggings in the description and it fit me great, this wouldn't even get up my thighs, not very stretchy at all. there should be warnings that it runs extremely small so people who have a little to them like myself know to look elsewhere. I am pissed off I waited all this time seeing all these great reviews.  I should not have to look in plus size when I'm a tiny bit curvy, VERY DISAPPOINTED, and definitely returning this crap"
"Too large, but much shorter than pictured - I'm 5'7""."
For little girls not grown women
These flops were much smaller than typical shoes.  Also - no strap. Picture and description are deceiving.  Just a regular flop like you can get at Walmart or Old Navy.
It's really cheap feeling. Like something you would find in the Halloween section of Big Lots. The color is nice though.
"This is did not fit at all.  I got two in the mail,  one was perfect and was looked like it was for a child.  I ended up giving it my niece. I am 5'4 and it cam up to my knees."
"The ridges on the soles of these shoes make me feel as if I am walking on pebbles.  The shoe is attractive, just uncomfortable for me."
They were too narrow - more so than a typical B width boot.  I also did not like the tongue is taller than the rest of the boot and seems overly long in comparison.
"Honestly, I had high hopes for these socks but see above. Just getting by with these, next time will go for Hanes, much thicker socks for cold weather."
Returned these they were scratchy and fit small
Arrived thinner & much smaller than expected.  Returned this shirt as it fit as if it were a Large Tall
"These leggings were great looking -- exactly as shown.  Unfortunately, the ""Free Size"" translated to XS or smaller; couldn't even get them on.  However, I had previously gotten another pair -- the starry night pattern -- and they fit great.  Take your chances."
Very rough texture. Would not order again
These are pretty non outstanding as far as fluffy boot covers go. I ended up going for another pair of white sparkles I found on a different website. These were kind of limp dumb looking
I don't like this at all but the price was low so i will keep it..its stiff and i had to bend it into shape..truly poor workmanship..i don't think it will last long at all..
"Didn't feel good on my feet. Did not stabilize well, either."
"Looks nothing like pictured. Face is very messed up, mask is too large for even the largest person, basically droops over your head"
The price was good but within a few weeks the second hand fell off? Some times saving a little is not worth it. Other than that I liked the solar self sufficient power. Only use these types or auto movement. Watch batteries are bad for the environment.
"narrow toe box, cheap feel"
"Runs small, was disappointed in material and make of shirt even ordered bigger size. Made out of a stretchy material."
it was small
not comfortable at all heel way too narrow
These were not at all what I expected and had to be returned.  Not made in proportion to American sizes.  Sorry.
"Very thin, super-light fabric. Quality of shirt  unimpressive. I need to repair it before I will wear it."
Didn't receive cross earrings! I received drop earrings instead.  If you read the details it says drop earrings!  The product is not as pictured
"The bra has no support at all for an underwire bra, will not buy this bra again.  Use to lounge around house, cannot wear under good clothing because no support."
Did not match the description in the ad. Way too small
foreign
"The jacket is nice but the sizing is totally wrong ....
It's real small even in the shoulder ... Thank God Amazon has a no pain return policy where I don't even have to leave the house !"
I gave it a chance inspire of the reviews. Don't waste your money. This is not a winter jacket. The zipper you just have to zip slowly but it was a pain in the butt to remember. As for the color of the zipper mine was covers by the flap that the zipper was getting stuck to smh.
I bought this due to the positive reviews it received here but when I received it I was so disappointed. The bottoms fit perfectly while the top was way too large. I would recommend you to steer clear of purchasing this.
This item ran small and unfortunately had to be returned. Perhaps a bigger size will be better...
"Not us sizing, this are defiantly made for a tiny person, or maybe a 10 year old."
"Good looking watch, big but uncomfortable--crown digs into my hand and a couple splashes and it stopped working!  Description says water resistant but it's not, it's quite cheaply made."
"ordered xl when I can fit either large or lx, but could not get the sleeves over my elbow! Gave to friend that usually wears large and she couldn't button it, ok for her as over shirt.  Not sure who this will fit!!!"
"Items broke in two places after purchase. The bottom hinge disconnected on one side. And, on the inside, one of the slots has broken apart."
"Unfortunately, these shoes have a terrible cheap plastic odor and I had a hard time taking them out of the box.  They look wide.  I plan to return due to the smell alone.  Can't bear to have my kiddo wearing these shoes."
"Had to send this one back.  As my son put it ""it looks like a toddler drew on the heart and chain""
Mostly sending this back because of the pants.  They were completely see through.  Looks like they were made out of drapery sheer material.  I would have to buy another set of pants just to put under this one.  Trying a different company.  Rubies is getting too cheaply made."
Broke in one day of waring it.
"I had to return this jacket. It was small for the size, even for junior's sizing. Also the material comes across as kind of cheap. it's doable, but you definitely are getting what you pay for."
Designed poorly and fit runs very small.
Too small not wort h to return cause it took long to be delivered
"Good idea, but it was difficult getting them through my lace-up holes on my sneakers. Too bad, I like the color selection."
"I bought this backpack in September 2011 for a middle school student.  The first issue with this backpack is that it is quite heavy. It weighs 5 pounds empty. Add another 20 pounds of books, notebooks, a laptop, etc it becomes extremely heavy to carry on one's back. So, why not use the pull out handle?  The handle is not sturdy in this backpack. It looked suspiciously unstable and wobbly . As expected it simply broke off in mid December. Therefore, the backpack lasted about 3 and a half months. The way handle broke it can not be fixed and since the backpack is so heavy with books it has become unusable."
I was send a pair of womens size 8 modi 2 flip in brown and tan...not mens size 8 crocs modi 2 realtreee max-4 mens flip flops.  Very disappointed.
Shirt is for asian men not American men. It should state in future. I loved the style it just don't fit a true 3x man
Arrived squished and bent... not very nice materials.
Uncomfortable.  Feels like stiff cardboard.  Wore once.  Probably won't wear again.
"I guess you are not supposed to let this touch the water. I bought this to wear with my swimsuit for the pool parties in Vegas and within the first time I wore it, and I didn't even submerge in the water, the gold part turned kind of a grayish green. Poor quality!"
"Perhaps I received a poorly made model, or perhaps all these hats are much, much too large.  I have a normal sized (at least) head, but this silly things would not even grasp my head.  I had to return it.  Too bad, because I do like the style.  If only the manufacturer would size it properly so it can be used on a normal sized woman's head!"
"Super cheap. Bought it as a gift, disappointed since I have bought stuff from Konov in the past & have been pleased."
"Very uncomfortable, pure quality  ,material like paper  card box"
Returned for poor fit
came with a dead battery
"If your goal is to look like Buck Owens on hee haw, mission accomplished. Your new grandpa blazer has plenty of padding to protect you  from hurting yourself. Just pretend to pluck those strings like a boss. This sturdy piece made me feel like a real man, made my daddy proud. Don't forget to wear a giant  belt buckle to complete the look."
I should have gotten a size 8-81/2 these were way to small but the size said 71/3 which is what I wear. I returned them
"Sizing is inconsistent.  I bought 2 pairs, one pair fits well, the other is too tight.  Seam also fell out of one pair.  I have never bought these jeans through Amazon before, maybe they sell the seconds here.  The ones I have bought directly from Dickies fit fine."
THe boots were nice but way too small. THe material on the inside was cut too far from the toe. They lose a lot of room with the design flaw.
While it is long and white it gets tangled easily and is very thin.
"The shirt was much larger than I expected it to be.  The sleeves were far too long, it was poorly proportioned in general and not well constructed.  Basically it looked like a super cheap version of what they are showing you in the picture.  I tried to exchange or return it but there was no response from the seller.  Not a good experience, I would not recommend buying anything from them!"
Boots arrived on 11/27/17.  As of 1/5/2018 the rubber on the sole has broken on the outside left foot along the crease of the rubber.  It is a 5 inch hole and the boots can not be worn anymore.  I only wore them to and from work and did not do excessive outside walking in them.  Very disappointed.  This is my 5th pair of Bearpaw boots purchased for my family and myself.
"There is not much stretch in these panties, and being high-content cotton, my pants and skirts don't ""glide"" over them."
This material was not as expected nor was it what was shown in the picture . I was excited to receive this item but as soon as I took it out of its packaging I stuffed it right back in the box disappointed.
very unhappy with the shoes they are pretty not the size I it states it is .too small want to send back but she already wore so ill have to give to goodwill . ordered size 11 too small and that's her size if I were to order again go up a size or two/
Beautiful watch but poorly made. Was so excited until I tried setting the timw and the second hand fell off. Disappointment.  Dont recommend this.
Quality was decent but difficult for a toddler to get their own foot in and zip up
Ouch!  These shoes are so painful.  I even lined them in padded tape and they still blister and scar my feet.  They are going in the garbage.
These socks are really worth a damn. It was after purchasing these and wearing them a couple times that I realized it make sense to pay a little more for decent socks. Most of the pairs in this pack have holes in the toes and I've worn them a handful of times.
"honestly, I am not sure I even received the same product.  the lines seem different."
"My wife wears mediums in EVERYTHING else, sweats, gym gear etc. but this item fits more like a small than a medium."
The belt strap seem like quality material and the buckle look nice - but the release does not work. Almost impossible to get it to release - which can be a great problem. I am considering returning it as defective.
"These made me look really short due to stopping right around my ankles. I think I have a very narrow ankle area or something because there was too much space around my ankles, so much so that they look like clogs on me. I am normally a 5.5 and these were a bit tight with socks, perfect without socks.

Looked so cute online, wish it could have worked out"
Save your money. I had these earrings for less then a week. First time I wore them I lost the backing but was able to find the actual earring. I then used the backings from another pair of earrings I had. Then next day I lost the other earing. The backings don't fit.
"THESE ARE THE TINIEST XL SHORTS I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!!! They look cheap and not at all like the photo. I do not recommend unless you are purchasing for a person who wears a size 3, not a size 12."
The colors were not as depicted. There wasn't a real color like I had hoped. I'm disappointed but too busy to return it.
didn't fit me at all. and i got a big size.
"not filled my expectations , very large"
"The dress fit as expected but the wig wouldn't even fit a 5 year old, and that's the only reason I even bought the costume!"
These slippers cut into the top part of my foot and yet were too big for my feet.  No quality at all.  Returned them right away.
"I just opened the package and right on top of the folded skirt, you can see threading that's coming out!! I will not even be trying this on. Also, the white looks like a nice, creamy white, but the outfit is like a pair of whitey tighties. If you want to take a chance, don't take it on the white. You'll be disappointed."
Dont buy this! Flimsy.
Weird cut
"There were a few duplicates and one of the pieces was missing a gem. They enclosed s paper that said they inspect and take pics of each package, that's why I didn't bother contacting them since they are so full of themselves but had flawed product I figured it would be a waste of time. The quality of everything else was what I expected. I was definitely hoping for more necklaces since they had a bunch in the photo but only got one and like 4 rings, everything else was earrings that had duplicates. Oh well I guess that's what I get for the price..."
Scale is much smaller than advertised. Not stretchy. Would not recommend.
"just like the headline said...I've worn wranglers in the past, and you're supposed to wear them long, but I don't wear cowboy boots anymore, and I ordered shorty shorts, so something was lost in communication. Also, these have a serious mom jean vibe."
"Arm holes are for a 7 year olds arms...
Giving it to my youngest daughter."
"These are adorable shoes. I ordered size 8.5 wide, and they do not fit. I had to give them away. I had a few people with normal sized feet try them on, and they all said that there is no way these are wide width."
"Shoe felt comfortable, but my foot is too narrow to even begin thinking about being able to keep then on. Full 1/2 inch too wide on narrowest size. Really like the shoes both style and comfort from cushioning, but the shoe would be worthless to me."
"Sometimes I forget we now get most of our stuff here in the US from Asian countries. I missed the fine print that says ""for girls under 5'4"" and 125 pounds"" What??? How many people are those going to fit? Make sure to read the fine print."
Too big. Returned.
Hard to pack. Collapses
The boots were too small in length and width; had hoped to exchange for a 13W but none available.  Ended up returning for refund and purchased a pair of Keen-they fit perfectly and were good to go right out of the box.
"This is a good looking bracelet. However, there is no practical way to attach the medical and identification info onto the inside of the bracelet. If I could locate my shipping info, I would return it. Pretty worthless."
"Brush feels dense but they are very flimsy. For the price, I would expect better overall quality. While it applied the product fine, the bristles are flimsy but dense. Flimsy is really not a great thing when it's 20 bucks. And application was no different than a 6 dollar brush. Japonseque has some other fine products in their line, but this is not one of them."
"Heads up, since last year all shoes I have bought run 1/2 size small to 1 size small. I think the Chinese factories have in my 30 pairs of shoes, for family and friends; I bought in the total of 12 months missed the correct sizing, completely."
"Not what I expected. A bit disappointing. Fabric is a cheap cotton, so its a bit uncomfortable. The 'string bow' is awkward looking as well."
"Unfortunately, this product sheds and is quite messy."
"My ears are at exactly 6mm, all other plugs fit my ears. However I cannot get these in. Maybe my own fault? Perhaps I should have gotten a size down in order for these plugs to fit along with the base flare?"
"too large, very narrow. Not like the KEDS I used to buy."
weird cut...uncomfortable.
"The size is right, but the right shoe hurt my toe.. I won't be wearing them... Right shoe is defective"
IS ANYTHING MADE IN THE U.S. ANYMORE GET THE CHART CORRECT.
"Although this robe fit as expected, the sewing was poor. It tore at the seams when my granddaughter sat down while wearing it."
The headband does not match with the skirt. Cheap material & is too large for a 8 lbs  newborn.
I am a medium (size 6) and I ordered a large figuring I'd be wearing a swim suit under this.  I found it to be poorly made and very clinging.  It was much longer than I expected for a cover up.
"I like the material, but it's no where near long enough. I was going to send it back but my sister wanted it for her daughter."
"What is going on with online clothing all of a sudden? Used to be able to make fairly decent purchases of name-brand clothing online at fair prices. Not anymore...EVERYTHING I've purchased online in the last six months that is clothing related has been absolute garbage including these boxers which were again, NOT TRUE TO SIZE. I get that things are being made all over the world now and that sizes vary but if it's sold in the US shouldn't US sizes apply? SMH..."
"I love this, and I have it in a few colors. This particular color (burgundy? wine?) developed several little holes after three washes."
I hate the way that these bracelets are connected.
"!!!FALSE ADVERTISING!!! I already own 32 Degrees Shirts (3 of them), and this is NOT A 32 Degree shirt!!!
This is simply a thin somewhat stretchy cotton T-shirt. Again, this is a knock off, There is No brand logo, and the
shirt is labeled 100% cotton, and fits slightly larger than the correct shirts do.
The 32Deg shirt is 87%Polyester and 13% Spandex. I will be returning it."
"Terrible fit, I even ordered the next size up. I had to get an emergency work shirt, they were supposed to provide anyway, but I got bumped to the top of the list when I came in wearing this one."
"This shoe has size 8.5 labeled on it. But it is no less then a 9.5. Maybe even a 10. I wear 8.5 to 9. So I ordered the 8.5. It was 3 or 4 sizes too large.

The Upper Exterior was man made material. Leather is lined on the inside. The description makes you think the shoe is leather on the exterior as well as the interior. I feel like I was deceived to think I was getting a leather shoe on the outside, and inside.

I have other Stacy Adams shoes in size nine I wear just fine.

Shipping it back costed me $18.50. If I try a new size and it's not right I will have spent $40 shipping them back. I'm not sure if I will ever try to buy shoes online again after this. :o("
Not for intense labor. I work in shotcrete and have to deal with wet and cement. These held up about two weeks. If your just shoveling snow or running a fork truck I suppose these would do. Not for dealing with rough and wet conditions.
The color is more pink than reflected here and they are incredibly uncomfortable. I sent them back.
"These undershirts are not soft at all and are such a poor fit on my 21 month old.  She is small for her age so maybe because they are a bit big they fit poorly, but the quality of the cotton is not good at all.  The Carter's brand camisoles are so much better, yes they are more expensive, but worth it if you are looking for something for a young toddler that is comfortable and will last."
The boot is very heavy and is not comfortable to walk with as it constantly slipping in the back heal.
Was not what I expected. Very comfortable keep your feet warm
"This item is ridiculously tight an the double seam at the bottom shows right through if you wear a knit dress.

Attempted to return it but seller informed me there is no refund if item was tried on.  If this was made known to me prior to placing order, I would have thought twice about using this seller."
"I bought these for my husband and they were too tight.  He always wears an XL and never deviates from that size.  These pants are an exception.  We both laughed when he tried them on because they fit like tights.  I sent them back for a refund and decided to go with a totally different brand.  Plus, they don't have pockets and that was a ""deal breaker"" for him.  I had multiple communications with the seller when I tried to return them.  I never did get a return authorization and I eventually got frustrated and gave up and gave the sweatpants to my father-in-law.  Live and learn......."
I should have ordered small.  It runs a lot bigger.
Its ugly and it really fits funny not worth the money at all
awful way too small why make a large option if its just going to come as small
way bigger than I originally thought...wish I could send back since I won't wear it
"These earings color are barely blue they look almost like a diamond with a hint of blue, also they were very small.  They were big enough for an infant but too small for my 6 yr old daughter.  These were disappointing"
The sizing info was not helpful so I bought the wrong width and had to return them.
"The fabric is smooth and comfortable, however, my second pair that my boyfriend ordered for me has holes. Unwearable."
"Metal grommets popped off the second i unwraped it, rectangle of reinforment near the handle attachment is now coming off, the leather badly glued to it is also coming off. sadly this is a really cute purse made VERY badly.
returning."
"Runs way, way too small"
"Too big, doesn't stay on your foot. Don't waste your money."
"I ordered these for a kindergarten project. They were OK.  They were smaller than expected, but that was probably my fault for not reading the description closer. However, the quality wasn't great. Some handles were falling off, some bags were pulled, and some handles had threads hanging off. The kids started pulling them and the handles would start unraveling. Luckily I bought extras."
"These are described as helping your feet align. They flop around like thick pancakes. If you have serious foot issues: metatarsalgia, tendonitis, arthritis -- these are not for you."
"I was hoping to wear these to yoga and exercise classes but they are see through, especially with bending :("
"I like the look, but they have to be mislabeled. They are at least a whole size too small. Very short. I bought size 6-1/2 and I could not even put them onto my feet. I bought 4 other similar styles of Vionics (6-1/2) and they fit awesome. Disappointing."
Low price and low quality.
Bottom came off a shoe.
"Based on the reviews and the sizing, I ordered one of these bra's thinking it would hold up well. I am a 36DDD/38DD and this bra didn't hold at all, not even with the straps. The cups didn't fit at all, and the wire was stabbing me in cleavage. I never wore it and it definitely was a waste of money because I wasn't able to return it. Don't waste your time."
I don't agree with the price at all.  I've spent this much on a few pairs of shoes and they are better quality.  I did not wear them to give full review because of the quality.
Flawed and broke first time
Wig itself is beautiful but the cap is small and kept sliding.  It did work for Mardi Gras.  I would not recommend this to a friend.
I really wanted to love these as the price is right but they are extremely heavy and clunky feeling. Was looking for a light weight indoor type of flip flop and sadly these are not that shoe so going back..
Very loose fitting.
"Returned them. They were very tight and hard to get on. They also have little to no flexibility, which is terrible for a child's foot."
I guess i ordered the wrong size im a size 14 and i think i was suppose to order a 12 but very stretchy
This shirt is huge. Fits like a tent.
"Very disappointed.  These are NOT non-skid socks.  Kids will fall wearing these on ceramic/hard wood floors.  Also they are fluffy, so forget about being able to use them as regular socks.  Not worth paying postage to return, so I've just got to strike this purchase up as lesson learned.  Although the sock is cute, my advice  - don't purchase."
"I ordered this set as a gift for my mom, and needless to say I'm returning it. It looks like little girls play jewelry. Its very small and not even close to as pretty as the picture. No way was this at one time worth $229. Its very cheap looking. It doesn't even fit comfortably around MY neck. I found another pearl set much more beautiful than this, my advice to you is look for another set like I did."
"These shoes were great for slipping on and dashing out of the house, and they're totally cute. However, the life of these shoes is very brief. After a month, there was virtually no sole left, and the cloth ripped at the toes at around the same time. Great shoes for a limited time; I got maybe five dollars of use out of them before I had to throw them out."
Poor quality also but returned due to size.
Did not like the way the wallet looked or the material. I sent it back asking for a refund.
"i got the regular ones for my blue boots, and had to split the back seam to get them to fit. these have a 2"" gap between my calf and the fabric. so they look awful. the split back seam is a way better look. not to mention these make me look like i have cankles when i do not. i plan to cut these down and turn into ankle booties, but not everyone has that ability."
"Cheap material, short length, not happy with this purchase"
"I had bought another pair of flats from this brand, (http://www.amazon.com/Wanted-Shoes-Womens-Glitter-Ballerina/dp/B0051EPCU8/ref=pd_sbs_shoe_1) and I loved them, so I thought I'd get another pair from the same brand, and picked this one.  But I'm really disappointed in it.  First of all, the material smells so strong, I can smell it in the kitchen even now (it's been like a month plus) from the shoe rack.  Also stinks up the car if I wear it.  Also, one of the stones fell out the second time I wore them.  I had to super glue it back on there, and the stone doesn't even really fit in the groove, I just had to shove it back in there somehow.  I'm thinking it won't hold well.

Oh well."
The dress is very pretty. Come mid thigh. If you is bottom heavy. IT'S REALLY NOT FOR US. the dress rise every time you walk. It fit very tight. Not much breathing room..not true to size have to go up a size or 2. 5 stars far as the dress and material 1 star far as fit
"to long. no way they were a 30"" lgth"
Started falling apart after first use!  Buyer beware!  This is leather??????
Georgeous boot! But buy at LEAST 1/2 size larger! Bummer when there is no 10 1/2 or 11!!!
"Description states ""UPF 50+.""  Tag on hat states ""UPF 50+ excepting woven mesh.""  As most of the hat other than the brim and a very small patch on top consists of open mesh you get UPF 0 for the whole top of your head. If, like me, you wear a hat to keep the bald crown of your head from burning this hat is utterly useless."
Very cute and the color (blue) was beautiful but there is ZERO support and that makes the suit look dumpy.
"Pretty enough, but I have worn dresses from this designer that I liked much better.  I agree with another reviewer--  kind of matronly (older person type of dress; mother of the bride).  This should be listed as a ""column"" dress, meaning straight up and down.  The hip area is VERY small and narrow.  I would recommend an ""A-line"" dress if you have hips, not this one.  I am 5'6"" and the bottom of the size 16 dress was about 2 inches off the ground in bare feet."
"The fan engine burned out. I tested the fan once when the costume arrived, for about two minutes, and then once on the afternoon of Halloween for about two minutes.  Other than that, I only used it once I got to my Halloween party.  After about 30 minutes it died.  I put in fresh batteries, and the fan turned on, but with little to no air-output.  I put in a second set of fresh batteries just to be sure, and got no result.
Cool costume in theory, but once the fan goes out you're wandering around all night with a limp Yoshi."
"When I first received this shirt, I was disappointed in the feeling of the fabric. It felt very light and cheaply made. Then I put it on (albeit at first, upside down) and the feeling was confirmed. It was also very itchy and is easier to wear as a cowl neck, rather than off the shoulder. I would not purchase this again nor recommend it as it will likely end up sitting in the back of my closet until my next Goodwill overhaul."
Probably the worst pair of shoes I ever purchased. Ordered up one size which provided adequate length but the left shoe was narrow and pinched to the point I was limping. I tried cutting the side of the insert down without any improvement. At least I didn't have to pay full price for them.
"used once looks like it will break
the pin"
One side is much longer! Seriously?
returned them....too small
I cannot recommend as sizing is a guessing game......
Hideous shapeless piece of plastic
"Beautiful chain, unfortunately did not fit."
"The packaging these hats came in was terrible, the wrinkles had wrinkles.  They look nothing like their picture, very flimsy.  The quality is minamal at best, but honestly the price speaks for itself....you get exactly what you pay for, a cheap throw away hat.  They come from China...that said, they are very poorly sown together, sewing is a bit lopsided. They are good enough to keep the sun off my head while on vacation for 2 weeks, they will NOT be coming back home with me....hence, the throw away hat!!!!"
"Pretty in photo...but the ruffle at top of boot would not stay up or straight, just ruined the whole look of the boot. Very disappointed. I was so hoping for a dressy ankle boot."
"The sandals were fit as expected, but they were heavy and hurt my toes wearing them."
"I followed the size chart on the box. They cut in at the top band and looked terrible, then immediately rolled down and looked even worse."
"Honestly, I avoid these in my sock drawer. Why haven't I thrown them out? Sometimes they are all thats left in my sock drawer. They invariably slip off a few times on each foot everytime I wear them. While I want invisible socks, I don't want bunched up at the bottom of my shoe socks."
Straps broke on both in less than 2 mo. These are flimsy and not like reefs I have bought before.
It is fake. And it is very bad. Don't buy it.
"I bought these socks for my four year old son, but they are too hard for him to put on. He can put on other types of socks; just not these because the cuff around the ankle is too snug. They have to be squashed up like stockings to get them on or they are sort of like one of those Chinese finger traps. Very disappointing -- the more things they can put on by themselves, the happier everyone is."
I don't really like the fit of the bottoms. They were off in the hip area for me. The material looked really washed out to me. I couldn't fit these and I got a small. I ended up giving it to my sister. So if you have wider hips then this would be the fit for you.
"It broke as soon as I picked it up from it's box.. Gave 3 away as Christmas gifts, they broke as well."
I couldn't wear
Too small and did not look like the picture at all. It was too small in the bust area and way too loose in the stomach area. It made me look pregnant. I returned it.
"Says ""100% Cotton"" and that's why I ordered it.  Received the sweat shirt today and the tag says ""50/50."" Therefore, I re-read the online description to find out how I screwed up.  Well, it appears, I have a case of premature cottonosis.  The first line of the description says ""100% cotton"" and that's where I stopped reading in my stupor of irrational exuberance in finding a 100% cotton sweat shirt.  In all fairness, I can speculate the description is less than false advertising as the 50% cotton content is made from 100% cotton.  Yeah, that's it."
"I was planning to wear this dress as a costume so I didn't really mind the quality of the fabric. Would never ever wear this if it were a dress for an event.  The fabric is fairly cheap looking. But the most disappointing aspect of this dress is that the sizing is way, way off."
"These are completely see through.  You have to wear white or a light color under it to be appropriate to go anywhere.  I'm a mom, so yea, no thanks"
Gaudy and too over the top....even if they fit I wouldn't have kept these. They're going back
"I wouldn't recommend this shoe to anybody.  The quality of one shoe was as expected from Dansko, but the other shoe was poor quality, too small, the stitching was sloppy and itched my foot.  Unfortunately the return cost was on me as the seller did not provide a free return policy."
"Too long for Petite, fleece is somewhat rough, and not at all soft. Warm, almost too warm. Color is nice, but not enough good about it to keep. Regret to return."
"I did not get the ivory bow pictured. Mine is a much more yellow ivory, and it has 3 smaller ""loops"" on each side of the center knot, vs. the one big loop on either side in the listing picture. Very thin, floppy material. Not cute at all! Save your money, & get a much cuter one from etsy!"
Worthless not large snuff to stretch women boots and if they did they just collapsed with no resistance
I ordered desert sand but got khaki instead. Disappointed. Its a tad on the small side as well and so it rides up. It also has that horrible Dickie's red tag on the back. The desert sand color was not suppose to have that tag. I'll be returning it.
its too small and tight
"I wear a 6 and purchsed a 7. I can barely get my foot in, without socks.
seller expects you to pay to ship them back"
"I love the look of the sock, however they are thin and I already have a hole in one pair after only wearing them twice."
I should have gone with my gut and ordered a brand with actual sizes.
"When I waer this shoe, I fell so hot. The upper is not breathable."
"seller was awesome, shipping costs from china are too high, she gave me 5$ back and i guess its worth t considering i didn't have to send it back. im 5'5 125 lbs. bought small (maybe medium better). I have 38 inch hips and  a bit of a butt, this was too much accentuation for the lower half as well."
"I bought these shoes after wanting them for months, they looked so fresh and sporty. I tried them on at the store and they fit great but when I wore them for a day they killed my feet and are extremely narrow. I don't have a wide foot but these are too tight at the bottom of the lace part and there is no way to widen them. I wanted to tough it out and break these in but my feet cant handle the pain on my big toe. I would recommend the Nike Free instead of the Flex if you have a wide foot."
The jewels fell out within a month.
Junk. The chain broke the first wear. I want  my money back and I plan to return.
"My daughter (college aged and healthy thin) ordered these, they are longer in the picture than in person. She even ordered a size up but they fit and looked uncomfortable."
Crown wheel came out of watch as I was setting the time and date the first time.
"This is described as a sweater but is really, really thin material. Was not at all what I expected. The quality of this product will affect my future purchases of clothing."
"This is NOT sterling silver as I wore it for only 1 hour and it turned my finger green. I will not be purchasing jewelry from this company again. Very disappointed as I really wanted an authentic spoon ring. While it is marked, ""925""...it is not authentic. :/  Total waste of money."
This bra feels good for about the first 2 hours you wear it. Then the band that goes across your rib cage gets bunched up and twisted and it diggs into your skin. I am always having to go into the bathroom and pull it down or readjust during the day. Also the cup is shaped like a cone under your shirt ( SO NOT NATURAL LOOKING AT ALL) Also the cone shaped cup material ruchees from the nipple up to the arm strap after you have been waering it awhile. This product is not worth your money. Mine went to the goodwill.
"I can't stand wearing this bracelet! I mean, I like it, it's pretty, it looks nice, but it pulls and snags my little arm hairs n I'm not even that hairy at all! It's so unfortunate bcs I really like it but it's such a pain to wear :(
I would say if you like stony bracelets and don't mind paying arnd $10 AND you're mostly hairless, go for it, but otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it."
never ware it cause its got giant sleeves..
My Kid is 15 a little big on Her she might grow in to it
"These are so-so. Stems are quite short. Have trouble putting them in my daughters ears. The stems keep falling off.
Two pairs are bent......
I understand they are cheap, and I can see why!!"
"worked but very cheaply made,  there are 3 screws that come with it and 2 fell out and ii was able to just push them back in as if they were too small for the holes"
This product doesn't deserve any star. Please see pictures below for  the best I could do to make a perfect fit.  Terrible material. With my size I could hardly cover up my bust. Please stop this.
"You get what you pay for. Material is cheap and it has a smell. I am usually a size S, but this dress what very tight.  I wouldn't recommend this dress."
"Material is too thin, waist band feels cheap, leg band too tight, and they're awkwardly long."
Not really happy as this product is way to long. And does not gather at waist as shown. Ordered medium. Perhaps small would have been better for 5ft 120 pds
"Beautiful shoe, but the strap that goes around the back of the heel is far too short to make it around my foot (and yes, this is the size I always wear in Clarks shoes.) My plan is to return them. Due to the shortness of the strap, I would have to order a half-size up!"
this product was shipped from Japan I did not know this when I place this order the sweater is way too small for an extra large
"I really wanted to like these flats. They look super cute, and came in the mail quickly. They also fit true to size. The reason i'm giving them one star, however, is that i've worn them TWICE, for less than an hour each time, and they have a hole in the bottom already. The rubber ripped right open on the bottom like it was nothing. Very cheaply made, good for a one-time use if you just need something to go with an outfit. But don't expect them to last long."
The rubber on the tip of the toe is started to come off both shoes after 4 weeks of wearing them.  This is a bummer because I won't be able to glue it back up and make it look good.
"It would have been fine if I wanted to look like a cast member for Wolves on Ice. (Not a real show...I don't think.) Totally felt like an ice skaters outfit. It would probably have been comfortable but just wasn't my cup of tea. The seam that brings the top and bottom together hits at a weirdly high spot and made me look like I had a super short torso. I'm 5'2"", 130lbs and fairly busty. Didn't like the costume, back to the drawing board! :/"
"They are cheap glasses the screw popped out leaving them unusable. Didn't waste any money, but not buying again."
"We bought this watch twice.  The first time was over the summer, and it worked great for three months (on an eight year old's arm).  Then, it stopped working.  I tried replacing the battery, and that did not fix the problem.  So I figured maybe ours was a dud (based on all of the great reviews for this watch) and there didn't seem to be a better or sturdier kid's watch available, so I ordered it again.  This time, the glow light never worked and the watch only made it a week before it stopped working!  I had thrown away all the guarantee information, assuming that surely I wouldn't get two bad ones in a row."
"The fit was quite odd. It seemed larger in some areas and then snug in other areas. The orange contrast stitching wasn't pleasing to me. It would have been nicer if the stitching was a lighter golden shade like traditional jean jackets or if it was black, gray or even white. I really wanted to like this jacket and hoped it would have worked out as a gift. Clothing is very subjective to taste and sizing, so it is hard to recommend this jacket."
"It is just my personal opinion but when this came with some wrong items, I felt it looked gaudy and cheap looking."
"Nicely made pair of shoes, and not heavy. Unfortunately, as with most manufacturers, the width is good but toe room narrows too dramatically .like most people I have toes, not one big claw in the center. Sent them back  amazon accepted. Thank you Amazon."
Normally I love Bogs as very durable.  But these have developed a hole inside the back of one of the heals after only 7 months of infrequent use.  I can only assume these are either defective or poorly designed.  I've had my other pair of Bogs for at least 3-4 years now and they have held up much better to almost daily use.
"Well, got this due to add-on pricing. Product seems well made but before I could have my son wear it, I had to wash it first. Lo and behold, 4 different small holes appeared near the buttons and lower hem (all in the front). The shirt will end up as a ""house clothes"" and not for school wearing. I paid $7.59, not worth it."
"Very cute pants, were just too small.  The review is not for the pants but for the return of the pants.  I don't know what is going on but I am being charged for pants I no longer have.  I sent them back in the same package with the liverpool pants but they said they only got the liverpool pants back.  So how on earth did they get one pair and not the other if they were in the same package."
Poorly designed for a size 16 woman. The closure would have to be several inches below my belly in order to close and at that point my hip are to big. This a size I often wear.
"Photo misleading! ... Buyer beware!...

The hat sent to us had no grommets ... !  Not good!

Misrepresentation!"
I read the reviews and I ordered a smaller size and it was still too large.
The woman in the pic models it much better.  OMG it gave me shelf in the back and I looked preggers.  Sending back.
Thought stone would be larger so small hard to see. I was disappointed!
"I gave this only two stars because I can't fit my ass in the bottoms without it smooshing my butt checks and making it look weird. The top is cute, but I wear a small b cup, and it's a very true b with no potential for ""pushup"" like it said. I may still use the top with another bottom tho. I ordered the small"
"I ordered the grey one, when I got it it's like a mix of brown, yellow, and greyish color. What the heck? It is not the beautiful grey color as shown above."
My last favorite scrub set out of many that I own. Material is thin. Lacking any useful pocket. Drawstring. Size is as expected but the fit is rather awkward. Wouldn't buy a pair for half the price.
I have always worn a size 5 and a half. The foot part of the sandal is more than big enough to accommodate my foot. It's the lacing above that is so close to the Sandal bottom that I can't even slide my foot into it. Another friend who is a size 5 even smaller than I am could not fit her put into it either due to the straps making it impossible. I'm so bummed that I can't even get these On My Feet. I feel really ripped off quite honestly.
"I bought the same pack 2 weeks ago and they fit perfect. This time they were way to small, and don't have all the cushion"
"I was SO excited to get these because I had a pair several years ago that were amazing...sadly I was disappointed this time. The fabric was not soft inside and the fit was definitely tight (I recommend sizing up if you choose to buy these). Also, they developed holes in the fabric on my bum, near the seam at the top of my thigh area after I had worn them only 3 or 4 times. The only plus was they do look like jeans and they have real pockets."
"I like that these are thin fabric ONLY for fitting underneath jeans if these weren't so baggy and loose.

I expected these to look like the picture, but you can see light through the ones I received  :(  They remind me of cheap knock-off jockey shorts.

These are too loose and baggy to be comfortable, and being loose and baggy, I couldn't wear them underneath anything  :(

I am 5' 6"" and a hefty 224 lbs - most definitely a couch potato.  Size 1x is much too loose (I usually wear a 2x for bottoms).  I've already washed them so I can't return them, so I'll put a note on them and donate to Salvation Army where I know they'll get an appreciative person.

I may or may not try a smaller pair, I might stick with leggings under jeans."
Love the cut but runs very very small.  Gave it to a 14 year old friend who is flat chested and it was great on her
Not at all Brown. It's close to orange. But looked strong.
"The reviews were right, one of the sleeves was longer than the other. Not to noticeable however."
Cheap made and looks like it. Fits terrible and sides gapped!  They don't look like the picture. We ended up throwing in trash because wasn't worth the cost and time of trying to send back!  Don't buy!
Nowhere near big enough
I don't think these are real Crocs.  They were about a size and a half too big.  I am a 7 and these were more of an 8 1/2.
"These aren't really ""padded"". Spend the extra on the Champion socks instead."
"Not fit at all.
Small size.
Not happy with product.
I will enjoy to use this shoes,but the size is incorrect"
"I sent back and reordered, still broke within a week."
Very disappointed. My feet are extremely sensitive & swollen due to peripheral neuropathy. These 'looked' comfy. They weren't. I put them on for ten minutes & couldn't wait to get them off. Unbearable. Off to find something for my type of feet & the issues.
I ordered a size up and still couldn't get my foot into them. WAY TOO SMALL!!!
"really cheap quality.  all three of the hats I ordered arrived crushed and the felt was so thin there really was no way to fix them and make them look good.
The return and refund process was smooth."
Rips
This necklace felt cheap and looked unattractive. The chain's links kept turning and wouldn't lay flat. Returned and received a refund.
"These were purchased for my wife who averages anywhere from 20-25k steps with a fit bit a day.

Ok heres the good-
They are comfortable.
She liked the color
Were terribly expensive

The bad.
The seems and stitching were the first things to go, about a month of wearing them
Second and not far behind the glue on the sole started separating, which is kind of a big deal.
Lasted almost 4 months.

With the New Balance name and old reputation I would expect more from them and a better constructed shoe"
these shoes come up high in the back and have rubbed a blister on my feet multiple times.  I have tried the old bandaid trick and stretching them.  I would not buy again.
Hem stitching is not done the right way.
I ordered a size bigger than I normally wear and it was way too small.
"Ordered 2 sizes larger than usual, just in case, and I need 2 more sizes larger!  Company would do well to get the sizes figured out.
Had I not been out of town last month, I would return this!!  Very disappointed!"
Good leather wallet but too cumbersome fir getting to cellphone
"Back zipper broke three months after I bought the bag, which was too late to return it.  Would give it five stars if not for that."
Much larger than they appear.  Looks cheap
So so SO small. I followed other reviewers recommendations but the sleeves were super short and it almost fit me like a crop top.... It is now at Goodwill for someone who is much shorter than me. I'm 5'7.
"Having a great pair of sunglasses is important to me because I'm on the road constantly and I'm an outdoors man.  I really wanted to like this pair because they look so cool. I had them for a day then returned it.

1. They are physically attractive and but the quality/feel of the pair was disappointing.  Felt a little inferior in quality/material.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the lens scratch very easily.  The pair already had swirls that became visible when I tilted the glasses in the sun.

2. Although these were polarized, the objects I was looking at didn't look crisp or defined in the blazing sun.  They just appeared darker and dull.

For the price point, I would suggest the Revo sunglasses.  IMO, their polarized lens are one of the finest I've worn.  I had 2 different pairs in the past 20 years with blue water crystal lens that recently broke and thought I'd give Oakley a try.  Stick with what works.  I'm await for my new pair of Revo Holsby."
Looks more like a maternity blouse and it unraveled when worn
Sizes do not run normal
Great shirt. I ordered 2 sizes bigger but it was still fitting
The left boot was medium width....the right boot was wide width. The laces feel like there gunna brake every time i tie them. They have styrofoam soles and i slip all over the place. My back is killing me and im sueing caterpiller
"Not impressed. Upon opening, I noticed pulled Strings on the visible part of the left shoulder but I didn't want to go through the return process. Its very soft but not great quality"
Sucks...
Not good fit and side of shoes is too low
"Flying a lot, I always had suitcase envy when I saw folks effortfully pushing their suitcases so I decided to purchase this set.
Poor quality on the handle which feels week and unstable prevents you from trolling the suitcase correctly and when you try to just do the old roll on 2 wheels, it is very stiff,

Would not recommend at all, wish I could have gotten my money back,"
Very cheap fabric and see through.  I ordered it for my wedding to monogram and a set of pink ones for my bridesmaids. I am afraid that they can not wear them as it is more see through than classy.
"I've been ordering scrubs size small thru amazon only, but this one was so big that i just gave it to my friend."
Had to send back.  No problem with refund.
On the website it says they are straight leg 505. They couldn't be more wrong. There baggie in the thighs and butt. I should have listened to the reviewers they said the description of the jeans was wrong.
"I purchased these training pants for overnight wear. We cloth diapered, and didn't want to cave and buy pull ups now. I thought my nights of changing sheets in a sleep-deprived stupor were over. I read they were leak proof. They certainly are not. And my nights of changing sheets and cleaning up a cranky toddler continued until I finally caved and bought the darn pull ups."
"It is really nice looking and sturdy, but it is really heavy all by itself.  Add a few magazines and an ipad to it and it's too heavy to carry over your shoulder."
"I am a large woman and I read the reviews and decided to go a size up so, I ordered a 3X and it doesn't even go around me or my breasts. Will definitely be returning if my bestie can't use it. I am a 44DDD"
"I really want to love these shoes. They are so pretty. They match endless outfits... my fianc commented I love your Cinderella slippers. The reason for the 2 star review: blisters. Although very pretty, they are not comfortable. Even wearing at during a day I had mostly paperwork to do and not much walking, I had to put bandaids on the back of my heel at like 9:30. So pretty, so painful. Like mama said, glass slippers will give you blisters. I will still wear them because they are so cute, and I wear preemptively bandaid appropriately. Beauty is pain."
The shorts are a little loose and the material isn't as soft and light as I had expected.
"I can't really tell how well these shoes would be because they were 2 sizes to big for me. Don't get  me wrong I actually love Reebok; they never let me down, this is a first."
"The midsection fit well some what smaller but id rather that then being baggy,  HOWEVER the arms were to baggy for my taste. I'm contemplating exchanges but i think the middle area might be unflatteringly tight. i won't purchase again tho."
These kept slipping under my heel... annoying.
"The pattern is really cute and pretty, but the design of the suit is weird. It definitely makes you look slimmer, but the top part felt like I was going to fall out of it. I'm not a busty girl either, but the straps on it didn't do anything to actually pull the shelf on it up. If I bought the size up it probably would be baggy in my stomach/backside area (I'm 5'10'' and slender) I do have a long torso, but the way the top shelf hit me would barely cover my chest. I'd imagine if you're shorter and more flat chested this might work, but if you're completely opposite proportions I would stay away from this swimsuit."
As much as I like these there is no possible way that I can leave a good review.
"I ordered a size large so that it would be as baggy on me as it is in the picture. Well, that's not the case. When I received it, I couldn't even get it over my shoulders, it looks like a size for a toddler. Don't waste your time or money."
"This belt was much cheaper quality than I expected.  It's OK.  The color is kind of weird, so I haven't worn it."
"This shirt fits me well and is tailored well. But, I was expecting the colors to be red, white and blue. But the white is actually off-white kinda beige, which is the color I do not prefer to wear. I am giving a 2 star because the picture of shirt was not true. DO NOT BUY this product if you expect the white to be actually color white and not beige or off-white."
"VERY disapointed! NOT true to size, AND, front closure was plastic and difficult to work, so I sent it back the next day.
and requested a refund, which was approved immediately! UPS came and picked it up and refund was applied to my
acct."
This costume is really cheap looking! This picture is photoshopped for sure. The material is really itchy. Would not recommend this product.
"I spent some time trying to find a size comparison what medium or large would be equal to on the item page on Amazon. I wear a size 9 shoe so I took a chance on a large. When they arrived on the bottom is marked  US9.5- 10.5, I thought great I guessed right. The only way I can come close to getting them on is without socks. This is probably why they were half price. Hope they will stretch."
The quality is not very good. Thin bandage material
Chintzy chain.
They look like old gramma shoes when they are on.
It didn't fit right. I hated the structure. It simply wasn't what I expected. I am not satisfied
"disappointing, it dips way too low at the center, tried to shorten it, but that just wasn't working too well either. Use it for scraps now. not worth buying"
"very small, I always wear 7, never goes up to 7.5 and above, but these are small, can't fit, but don't want to waste more money returning them"
Not exactly what I expected from pictures. I thought there would be slots for cards and license.
"Watch does not run. Garbage watch, returning for refund.

I have other ""cheap"" skeleton watches that are still working after 7 years of use that cost half what this one cost and this one lasted less than 30 seconds.

Amazon needs to weed out these sellers of junk merchandise."
"Purple rabbit version arrived faded, and got worse with washing."
"It doesn't look anything like the picture, has a few small heart cutouts but more circles or odd shapes and it's not round more oval... very disappointed"
"Would of been no stars but shipping was on time. Bag design was so scary looking didn't look like skulls looks like clowns! In picture bag looks huge for woman which I loved, but bag is small in size could fit daughters 1inch binder in it. And the worst part is the smell, can't even describe the stickiness! Wasn't worth returning and paying return fees so I just threw it away!"
Its toe is so tight even a bigger size. but it is cute especially the pink one. be careful about the size.
Did not offer width in  4EEEE which i need. To narrow.
"Really cute, my daughter loves it. But the shirt itself is VERY poor quality. Washed it once and it looks terrible."
The mittens are fine but the hat is too small.
my husband could only wear it for picture and we had to give it away -- WAY TOO Small and Tight
"Its only $7,99 and my expectations where on the low side to begin with, considering the price with shipping included. And I was right, its flimsy, barely worth the $$. UNTIL I decided to wash my hands and wetted it. Next morning it was flooded with moisture. Has to make a tough decision. Either never again wash my hands (let not even think about taking a shower) or return it. Guess what side won.

Not for scuba diving, but ANY watch should be at least water RESISTANT. This one is not. Stay away."
"Well,  I am no longer happy. I wore the first pair for less than two hours while cleaning the kitchen and loving room and the right one broke. I assumed it was a fluke.  I had the second pair on for less than 30 minutes total.  Drove to town and again, the right one broke while driving.

Put on the third pair, walked maybe 20ft to my desk and sat down to work.  Again. The right one broke.  I wasn't hard on them & fit was perfect.  I'm sad now.

I was so excited to find these flip flops at a fair price. I used to purchase these at a local store but they no longer carry them. They have been my favorite summer shoes for over 10 years.  I usually buy three pairs each summer."
Looks good on. Light weight. Bifocal area way to small making it diff to focus on objects needing to see. Have to tilt your head way up if driving with them and you need to see numbers exp on your radio or temp. Love the glasses just not functional for me. I did order another pair from another company with larger bifocal area and  they are prefect for me just a little heavy.
I should ordered a 9/10.
"As a medium with, this shoe can only be worn by a narrow foot.  It was so narrow, I couldn't put my foot in even 1/3 of the way the entrance is SO narrow."
"Returned didn't like the funky ""leather band""."
"Hard part lining the heel is sharp and digs in to the foot, I wouldn't be surprised if it broke through the lining within a month. Returned immediately."
"Thin, cheap material. Not stretchy. I bought silver, but colour is not exactly same as picture."
They look nice. But right out of the box you can see the posts are bent. I bent them back slightly but judging from how thin and flimsy they are I'm sure they'll fall of sooner than later. Pending a replacement of better quality I don't see buying from this company again. I ordered a pair for my niece from another seller for the exact same price and they were top notch !
"I didn't expect a lifetime from a belt this cheap, but it separated in days. no worth the money."
the fit was way too small
Definitely Not one size fits all.  Cheaply made.  No tags at all for size or washing instructions.
"This dress fits fine, but the pattern you are showing it's not what was delivered. Totally different color all together."
I was excited to get the bag however when you walk the zippers clink against eachother and it drove me crazy. Returned.
Good running shoes but doesn't last very long.
a little too long on me 33 waist but it does the job and decent quality
"I returned this as it was just too loose and silky for my taste.  If you have a tighter-fitting dress, I would not recommend this as it will move and bunch."
Flemsy plastic and cheap construction. Lights and sounds are cool however. Would not purchase as a gift becsuse it looks like something from the dollar store.
"The material is very comfy and I like them alot,, but the pocket, just isn't quite large enough for me. Its probably ok for smaller guys, I'm a medium size American guy, not huge, not small and I can barely fit everything in . If the pocket was just alittle bigger.wider at the bottom, ...... If your a smaller size guy, you'll love them."
"Fits very good, quality of fabric is really nice, soft.  I don't like the undershirt, fabric is not the same!"
Too big for me but the construction is well done.
"Didn't fit as expected, probably a good bra just not right for me."
Started falling apart within days. Way too short for my sons convers shoes.
The side pockets are made of mesh and do not hold  well to everyday use. My son loved it having his school colors.
"These are nice, but they are not book ended.  They are two earrings identical so they don't really hang as well as I would like.  Will be more careful to look at that before ordering earrings again."
Pretty earrings although not as 'Swarovski' as I'd like.
kinda cheaply made and the glass has come unglued...but it is ok for now.
"Very thin, not the best material. threads of the material already running. If looking for a tote bag for a cheap price - better to buy in bulk from ""duratech group"""
Good walking shoes but not for long walks. The back of the shoe hurts and blistered my feet. Wear with socks
"The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because it's not one size fits all. It fits me like a dream because I'm at 36B, I wouldn't recommend it for anyone larger than that. Super cute and stretchy. Very comfortable."
comfortable except for in between the big toe for long periods
"Meh. Its ok. I don't really think it fits like a boyfriend cut. That or their sizes run small. I like the color, but it appears more muted in person than in the photo."
Falls off.....I lose it every time I wear it!
"I ordered 2 pks of these. 1 pk was the actual fruit of the loom camis, the other was another brand made of nylon."
They don't look like the picture at all and no one liked them and I sent them back.
"I was disapointed I could not tighten these up more, since there is a velcro adjustment. I can still wear them, but it's not as comfortable of a fit as I would have liked"
Great fit but there were some asthetic flaws. The shoe was new but there were some marks on the leather that were not removable and noticable enough to take away from the shoe.
Not very high quality in my opinion.
"The quality is ok, not sure how long the straps will last.  The problem is that its made for a childs arm.  My arms are pretty thin around the wrist, but I cant wear it."
"The pattern was cute and the fabric was nice but gosh was it small, fit me like a shirt. Was tight around the hips, I ordered a large and its still tight and I usually wear L or XL depending on brand. I am 5 foot 8 and its like a shirt on me."
"It's nice but... it was unclear what material I was getting. The wallet is small, minimal, and nice. But as someone who wants to buy cruelty-free products, I was disappointed to find that the card this came with claimed it is made of leather. The description of the wallet says it features ""Premium Thin Leather PU Canvas and precision oiled edges"". I googled PU Leather and found it was synthetic/artificial leather, not the genuine thing - however, it can sometimes contain leather. So I checked the other version and it features ""Premium Thin Canvas and precision oiled edges"". I also checked the more detailed description of the wallet I ordered and it says, ""It is constructed using only one piece Premium Canvas with a nylon lining."" The description saying the wallet is made of canvas and nylon gave me the impression that it was not made from animal products. So while it's nice, I definitely would not buy it again."
So far quite satisfied however water leaves stain marks !!
Size width is ok and it's a nice style but shirt is shorter than a Big Tall should be.
"I'm wearing these for my wedding. They are very confortable, price right."
I wish the foot had a little bit more room. The shoes are a little too tight.
It was a little shorter than I thought it would be.  It was a gift and the recipient loved it.
"I had the fishing boot version prior to this one and that model was easier to slip into, but had full/half sizing, so the fit was not as tailored. This boot feels great"
"I am glad I ordered a wide width! They still really rub your toes and the buckle bites! If I'm not wearing them a lot, it's fine. But I don't see myself wearing them to work, which was the original plan."
Beautiful earrings but the pin is a bit big and my wife couldn't wear them because it was stretching out her ear.
"Its not great qualilty, so I only use it to store cards I don't use often.  I think it would wear out quickly if it was used daily."
not so resistent
"Belt functions okay. But I wanted the one in the photo that had the belt and buckle the same color. The one I got, the belt is tan, like I wanted, the buckle is dark brown. Don't care for the contrast."
Kid wore them maybe once.  Wasn't real impressed.
"I got an XXL because I didn't want it to cling to me and as it turns out the XXL fit my shoulders and that surprised me as my true size is XL from
the photo the shirt looks longer than what it is but I will keep it even if it is a little clingy won't get another."
"Still looking for old style high cotton content ankle high socks. These are good but not great.  I miss the cotton socks with thicker, more absorbent sole padding and not so thin everywhere else."
"The fabric's not that comfortable.

They're a bit ugly. They look significantly better in the Amazon pic than they do in real life.

The shape isn't that great - the lower butt part is pretty high so it doesn't cover my whole butt. The pouch doesn't seem more useful than the regular opening other underwear have."
"Bottoms are too tight, top is too large but part tgat loops around the neck is very tight and thin. Awkward fit."
"These are okay, I did not expect the waist line to come up so high or the legs to be cut out so high. Don't think I will buy these again, but they will do."
Not a fan of the hood and the way it sat. Always had this awkward fabric thing going on on the sides.
"The boot itself is cute, well made, waterproof, and sturdy. However, it hits at just below the part where my calves taper and it's really unflattering and kinda diesel-looking, frankly. And while there's nothing wrong with looking diesel, it's not my particular thing. Motorcycle boots have enough toughness on their own and I returned these because I'd prefer a more flattering/slightly more feminine looking boot that still has some edge."
"It looks so much better online. I haven't completely felt like I like it a lot. Especially after I saw the material and the strands that was coming out of the top. It fits fine. I got a large because my hips are big but my breast are small.  As far as shipping go,  I ordered this March 31st and I got it today, April 11th."
Fit good work well except insoles came loose so I just took them out and they are fine!
"They are not exactly like OMG!!! I gotta have this, however they are nice for the price I paid can't beat that."
No padding in the bra and a bit too short for my torso
"It was a bit larger and thicker than I was expecting, but the company contacted me right away to make amends.  I appreciated that very much.  But on the negative side, it is a bit of false advertisement as it shows a young woman wearing it as quite well fitted and looks like thin cotton type shirt.  This material is closer to almost a flannel material. Buyer be aware."
The heel height doesn't match the photo of the shoe. It's much lower. Now I end up with 2 shoes the same color and the same height.
"These fit very large and I was less than impressed with the quality. Frankly, I expect better from Sperry. The rubber on the lowers seemed more like thick foam with an outer coating more than tough rubber for a snow boot. They also made a lot of noise when I tried them on/walked around."
"A little too big for my nephew, but u know the saying, ""too big is a fit"", he will grow into it"
"Necklace is cute, however, I would like it better if it were on a 16"" chain.  I cannot seem to remove the bow to put on a shorter change.  It gets stuck around headphones while working out because it is just a little bit longer.  Otherwise, it is a small, cute bow."
"Nice but a bit cheaply built. Love the color

Afraid that if you don't handle it with care or over fill it, it will crack open because  a bit too thin.

I guess you get what you pay for that price."
Uncle Fester polyester
"I really liked the look of this shirt. I decided to keep it based on the tanktop alone. The top layer was a bit short for my torso. I wore it out anyway and got several compliments but it was a struggle to keep it pulled down. I ordered a med. I'm 5'5, 135ish, with Ds and I often have trouble finding long enough shirts so if clothes usually fit you length wise Id say go for it."
Not what it shows in the pic.
Ordered one size up based on other reviews. The sleeves are too long and loose on me but the fit on the chest and waist was good though.
"Thumbs up for being cotton, good cup fit, just too tight around the band by about an inch."
"I ordered this boots for my dad, who loved them.  However, after just four months, the boots started opening at the sides. At first, there was an issue with sending them back.  However, after much communication with the sellers, the boots were taken back and a full refund given.  For comfort, I would give this five stars.  It is just unfortunate that they did not last long."
"Unfortunately, not try comfort I was hoping for, given its the easy spirit brand."
Works so-so. Have to use polishing cloth in conjunction with to polish it nicely.
"I did size up based on the reviews.  It could work for my bust, but even though I'm slim-hipped it just barely fit around-I could zip it but didn't want to hassle with having to tug to zip-back it goes"
I love these shoes but they are almost too wide.  They were such a good deal. I kept them anyway. I manage ;-).
Thought it would be a little larger in the mid section. Not bad. I do like the style and I did wear it twice so far.
I ended up pulling out the inside lining. It's okay. Durable and well made. Just a bit Small in the sizing.
"I like the wide toe box, and this is very cute with a lot of outfits. However, the sole is on the slippery side. Use with caution on laminate, marble, or similar slick floors. The shoes are made in China. The reason I have stuck with Keens and Danskos is that they are comfortable (for being on my feet all day) and have good soles. I was hoping to expand my horizon with these shoes (which come in a variety of very cute styles), but these will be the only pair of Alegria shoes I will own."
It wasn't all that I thought that it was....and it broke in half fairly quickly from simply just wearing it.
It has sort of a cup for your penis and the material touches your balls which is not very comfortable. I will be returning.
Fit okay but a bit shorter than the picture
Comfortable but material feels plastic so if you have sweaty feet can be problematic.
I'm 5'6 and the skirt appeared to be long.  But it was very short I'm the back.  The top was pretty big and mishaped as well so it didn't stay on properly.
I took the pads out of this and use them as sleeping nursing bras. So great!
"These were super tight, so sadly had to return them.  They are a cute style and loved the neutral color."
Not all cotton as I hoped.  I can't tolerate anything with polyester in it.  It's too hot to wear.
A little different from what I expected but it's still a good item.
very lite
"These for nicely and are fine for work. I was expecting them to be more comfortable inside. I don't walk much in them and I still feel like I need to go get gel inserts. If you can live with inserts, then these are good enough."
"Well I really want to like them, this is my first pair of clogs.  I do not find myself to have wide feet but when I wear these they rub the outside of my toes (sides) , Haven't given me blisters but definitely rubs on them till they are sore in those areas.  I have only worn them for a week now and I am wondering if I should of just bought the Danskos instead.  The price was unbeatable, but  yeah kind of wish I would of went with a slightly larger clog.  I worked 14 hours one night in these, and my legs didn't ache like normally so that is amazing!!! Just sore toes."
It's ok.  Normally wear a size 12 and ordered the large./xl but it is really loose.  Probably could have gotten away with the smaller size.
The color was a pale pink not the bright pink shown.
Loomed great. About 2 hours into the night the arm bands and waist band started to fall apart.
"This is a good thickness to keep you warm, however the fibers on this shawl are surprisingly long... on average they go out about 1/2 inch beyond the connecting threads... so it made me feel like you have to maintain the look and pile of this by brushing the fabric with some sort of delicate brush or your fingers and also dry-clean only. I'm sure you'd also have to be fairly careful when wearing this so it does not snag or get tangled too much. That being said though, it does look stunning. I gave this as a gift so I'm not sure how the upkeep has been."
"the shirt fits my 3.5 year old right now, but the undies won't fit for probably another 2 years... weird match up."
The size runs very small. The material in the front is very shiny and looks cheap. the dress is worth $30  but it also looks cheap. I am returning because of the size and quality.
"Its okay, nothing special, but okay"
"The neckline is really wide, which I don't like much. The sleeves are a little Amal for my liking, but my chunky baby still has room so not too tight. They're not terrible, but they work!"
"Work great, however they are a little tight if you have earphone on underneath"
Waist sizes run small.
clasp was really cheap looking and not sturdy.
"I am a women's true eight, but the size chart and other reviews, I got the 6. but it was way too big. instant return. not cute enough to warrant an exchange.  I have wide feet and like tight shoes. but this was like a long. skinny oval flipper.  I like their other shoe more. which I did keep and will exchange."
"I love the colors and styles of the scrubs that dickies has, but the material is stiff and somewhat inflexible. I prefer Cherokee. This top is very cute and stylish though."
"I ordered a small, and it was still quite roomy. Also, the white slip beneath is basically transparent so, I wear another slip beneath it. Fabric has held well!"
I really expected something better form Lucky Brand it looks a little shear on the sight.
returned only because I didn't end up loving the longer side otherwise dress was perfect.
"Way too small yet I asked them in a larger size. Good product and warm, but think buying them in adult size in S for big boys."
"My first Lily of France purchase. Not particularly impressed. Material looks too thin and stretchy to provide decent support. And when worn, my breasts jiggled about significantly when I tried jumping. The size L provided inadequate support for my 36Ds.

It's comfy though. So u can wear it for yoga but certainly not for jogging or kick boxing, both of which I do.

Also, although it says Reversible, the stitching at the top of the shoulder strap is obvious so people can tell you've reversed the bra. Though that style is so common these days, it may not matter to you. I personally don't like it when the stitching can be seen.

Since I live in Singapore, it's a waste of money to return the purchases, so I'll be using this, but with another bra underneath for added support.

Well, that's what you get if you aren't willing to splash out on better bras. Serves me right, I guess. ;)"
The skirt is cute but runs small
Product in the straps kinda weak broke them as soon as I unpackaged the package *sad face* material seems warm though
"The color is different from the picture. Here looks kinda beige and the one I got is olive green-ish. Not bad, but not the color I was expecting either."
"I bought a pair of these in khaki and black. They are comfortable, just like all the reviews suggest but because they're made out of this rubber-like material they don't seem to hold up very well. I've had each pair for less than 6 months and they're already showing noticeable signs of breakdown.

Pros:
-comfortable
-stylish

Cons:
-attract dirt and smudges easily (especially khaki color)
-hard to clean (can't put in washing machine because of leather)
-fall apart easily
expensive"
"Instantly became my favorite shoes!  No breaking in at all and instant comfort.  They were the only shoes I brought to Honolulu and wore them for 5 days straight, and my feet were happy!  I love the fact that they are closed toed shoes but I do not feel hot or sweaty in them.  I did however add an Aldo terry cloth insole to them, so my feet would not stick to the footbed, and adds a little more cushioning.  The best part is the outsole, which is fabulous for walking on any type of terrain, as it has a lot of grip, and is super sturdy.  If you're traveling in warmer climate and can only bring one pair of shoes, these are it!  The reason I'm only giving them 4* instead of 5 is because the memory foam footbed compacts down pretty quickly and does not rebound after the first 2 wearings, making the front much more roomy (maybe even too roomy if you have a thinner foot).  I wish they would mix some other types of cushioning in addition to the memory foam layer for a more sustained cushion.

Update: May 6, 2017.  The memory foam has really packed down to almost non existence, and for the first time I was very uncomfortable walking in them, as the front is so loose and the heel has almost no padding.  So I've added a heel pad and it is feeling a lot more comfy now.  Will be adding a pad for the front too and see if it will help.  There is no excuse for using inferior foam in such an expensive shoe, as the cushioning in all my other shoes are still going strong after way more wearings.  Therefore I've deducted a star*

I hope you found my review helpful. If so, I would greatly appreciate it if you would click the HELPFUL or YES button. Thanks so much and Happy Shopping! :)"
"nice mask, runs small"
Full size bigger than other shoes I have of the same size.
"In terms of style and comfort this shoe meets all the criteria, unfortunately I feel it's a bit on the heavy side for an active runner as myself,  size does run smaller as well so keep that in mind, order a size up.  But overall a good shoe for your daily routine use."

EDITED:

I did a ""pack test""  I compared this bag to my cheap, 4 wheel, ""I don't care what happens to it"" bag which I got at one of those discount designer stores.  I was traveling with carry on for 5 days, which I often do.  I put all my stuff in this bag, and when I did, neither of the compartments were serviceable.  I couldn't even get a tablet in the side pouch, and my liquids would not fit in the top pouch.  I had to transition everything to my other bag for the trip.

This bag doesn't have a lot of ""give"" so when it's packed full, that's it. There's no more room for anything else.  I find that problematic.  Honestly,  think this bag would be better suited to men's clothing and toiletries.  Unless he's a guy who travels with a lot of shoes."
"They are okay, just thought they were sterling silver"
Cute but way too small!  I had to return it.
No spot for laptop like described. Cheaper material than my last Roxy backpack.
"This is such a strange dress. I tried two different sizes and neither fit. The smaller was way too tight in the ribcage, as this dress has no stretch. The larger was HUGE in the breasts. And I am a DD cup! So bizarre. I sent back both."
"I expected them to be tighter.  While I'm sure they helped more then if I didn't wear anything at tall, I would like them  tighter."
I'm usually L size but this t shirts are way too long for me. I just do not like that.
"Works okay, get what you pay for"
"The fit was perfect when I first purchased.  Washed it one time and it shrank somewhat, not to the point of being uncomfortable.  I will probably purchase one size up knowing that this shirt will shrink."
"the bottom was tight, the top was OK. the arms a little tight but wearable. the skirt, I couldn't even zip it up. I am 5'3 150 lbs and I bought a L."
I ordered three different belts like this at the sqme time....this one cane in 2nd. Cheap and ok....just ok. Wolf tactical is MUCH Better.
I like them the size is way off. I gave them to a friend and ordered another pair.
"These are relatively cute and they get the job done, but I would only wear them at the beach or pool. The ankle straps are a weird rubber material so they rub against the skin in a very uncomfortable way. They also get very dirty and stained easily."
"I returned these jeans.. They did fit but were not comfortable on me. I think looked pretty nice, but just not the right fit for me. The return process was super easy.. so I like that:)
I think Jeans are just tough to buy without trying on.. at least for me."
"Nice shirt but way off on size. Fit more like a xxsmall but the sleeves were proper length if not slightly longer, body is way way way too small.."
I like the charm it's delicate looking but disappointed the charm will not fit on my sterling necklace. I will now have to buy a new chain in order to wear this charm. I wouldn't have purchased the charm had I know it would not fit on my necklace.
"Decent quality for the price for this open knit sweater. It is unexpectedly hi-lo and it runs more like an XL than L for me. I normally wear a M or L and tend closer to a L at 5'8"" 155. I will order a size down and then maybe it will be more fitted like the picture. Also the color is much warmer and a little darker in person."
"Okay, good for like 3-4 days"
cheaper than pictured but worked for what we needed them for
"I ordered these socks b/c I had some gold toe socks that I loved and wore until they almost disintegrated.  I thought these would replace them, but they did not.  These socks are just average cotton socks, nothing great.  And they shrunk a little after washing.  I finally discovered the Gold Toe socks that I used to own and loved--the ""acrylic"" gold toe socks.  They are stretchy, soft and warm.  I found them in a Gold Toe outlet store.  I highly recommend those.  So, I recommend the acrylic gold toe socks, and I do not recommend these (the cotton ones)."
"bought them last year, comfortable and cute but not well made. they scratch easily and look extremely worn after 8 months or so."
"The description I first saw of this made it sound like just a general moisturizer.  It's changed since them to focus more on post-menopausal skin.  I'm not menopausal yet let alone post.  But I do have skin that is fairly sensitive and that gets dry very easily.  So I figured this couldn't hurt.

The good news is that my skin definitely feels tighter and better moisturized than it has been lately.

The bad news is that the scent is too overpowering for me so I cannot use it regularly.

Great if you don't mind a strong scent.  If, like me that is a deal breaker for you, I'd try something else."
Kind of disappointed but really I got my $ worth versus paying a mall kiosk to replace it.  Give it a try.
"gives you major support...but certainly not a sexy thing at all. It's almost like the girls have been bad and they are now in jail....very tight, very uncomfortable by days end."
"I wanted to like this, especially since it's so stylish and I love Kate spade. But I found it to not be as accurate as I was expecting. See my attached pictures...

Pros: small profile and cute design. Comfortable and easy to wear.

Cons: instruction book was in the smallest font imaginable. The features are pretty limited and inaccurate.

You can track your steps, sleep, glasses of water, and exercise minutes, or set a custom goal. There are some other options like remote camera shutter and make your phone ring remotely.

I did a test to see how the step and sleep tracker worked. I'm a nursing mother to a 7 month old and typically get up twice a night. Last night I went to bed at 11pm, got up once at 2:30, and then was up for the day at 6:30am. The step tracker calculated my trip to the nursery and back twice (I checked this first thing in the morning) to be almost 100 steps. I measured it out and one trip should only be about 25 steps. It also said I only slept for 4.5 hours, which seems odd because I fell right asleep at 11pm, woke up at 6:15, and was only up with the baby once for about 15 minutes.

Overall, it's something I would probably return if I could. I wish there was a clock feature in here somewhere, especially for the price point. If it looks like a watch, at least tell me the time, right?"
"They're bigger than I expected, the pinky finger is way too long.  They seem like someone stitched these together at home."
"As other reviewers have mentioned, this is a thin material. I purchased the largest size expecting it to be a bit too small, and for it to be sheer because of how much I had stretched it. I'm about a size 18-20 and it actually fit fairly well, but it is a bit sheer in the rear.

However I bought these to lounge around the house in, or do yoga at the gym with a tunic-style shirt, so I'm not worried so much about it being see-through.

I am sad, though, knowing that these are not going to last for a very long time. While they are INCREDIBLY comfortable, they are thin and tend to pill where they rub together. I love these pants, but I'm only rating them a 4 star because they're too expensive for how often I'll have to replace them."
Package delivered on time. Product is exactly as said except it's very dark. The pic makes it look as light as silver or white Gold. This is very dark and doesn't match my white Gold engagement ring. I'm keeping anyway because it'll work for now but once we get our white Gold bands I'm tossing this one. It's definitely good for the price.
"Cheap stockings, came with runs already in them. Love the attached garter though, keeps them up without hassle."
Much smaller then appears.... Pretty and made well though
"I love Yellow Box flip flops but this shoe is a disappointment.  The fabric that goes across the top of the foot is scratchy and irritates my skin.  Otherwise, it has the great sole and look you would expect from Yellow Box."
The chain is cheap and alread broke but the pendant is very nice. Its heavy and may be the reason the chain came apart
Niice looking but very stiff and needs more support.
"While these are a little cheaper price-wise than other companies' pajamas, the fabric is a lot thinner and a little scratchy. The transfer on the front (the monster) is also a little thin and doesn't wash well. These are fun pajamas and my son was comfy in them after a wash. They're just not as cozy as I'd have expected from a brand like Gerber. They felt cheap and a bit flimsy."
cute -  but too high a heel - my legs hurt after a while - not a walking shoe  - ok for a short outing
"I was looking for a small wallet, but this one is much too small.  My driver's license wouldn't fit into the ID pocket, so I didn't even try to fit my credit cards in."
It for sure does not look like it does in the photo. But still kinda cute
For very thin boys.
"Way too small, its so short in the torso that my breast rest completely above it and it hardly reaches past the bottom of my ribcage which is where the cups sit when i try to put it on. Very disappoiinted at how oddly short it is."
I love the fact that the Bev Mev shoes are light weight and run narrow!!!  Too bad they also run short.  I usually wear size 11N but these shoes are just too short for me.  I wish they came in longer sizes.  (I could not wear a closed toe style of Bev Mev in size 42.)
Would like to have kept but it was about 2 sizes larger than reported.
"I wear a women's size 11. I don't usually fluctuate between sizes, an 11 fits perfect every time. I ordered these in a 44 and they were very small in both length and width."
thought it would fit loose like the one I bought local but fits too tight and has no style. It is soft so I keep it. I wear for cleaning the house.
"The stitching hurt the joint under my big toe. They were cute, but I had to return them. Also, they run small."
"I'm 5'1"", 115 lbs, and usually wear an S in spanx, although I found this one to be bigger than my other pairs. I ended up returning it bc it simply wasn't tight enough. (I wear a size 2 in other pants/jeans)"
I didn't like the faded look it has and there was was a snag on the material that stood out so I returned it with no hassle just had to pay the shipping label. I chose another dress from this seller because they have so many options.
They feel Great but the size chart is wrong
"Really, cute.  Runs a bit big.  Sheds a lot."
Seems like pretty good quality material but they were slightly big.
great shoes but the size nine fit like a ten with heavy socks on i have sent them back.
"Yes, nice tapered leg, but I suggest spending a little bit more money on a Nike pair. These are too thin to run outside in the winter. They are baggy everywhere but the ankles, even wearing a size small. The material is also cheap; I've been wearing them a week and there are so many little fabric pulls in the weave that they look old. Perfect for the gym."
"I needed some socks on short notice, and just wanted to order them online. These seemed to be rated ok, and weren't that expensive either. They are comfortable, but they shed too much, as in there is black sock fluff in the sock or stuck to my foot even after having washed these a few times. I doubt these will last awhile, but they are at least comfortable while they last I suppose. I rated these 3 stars since they fit fine and are comfortable, but I am having doubts as to their longevity as others have noted. Not to mention the shedding too. I'll update when they end up wearing out."
"If you lace all the holes it can get pretty weird, the tongue it seems is not quite long enough. I roll my ankles easy so for years I've always worn high tops and it's helped a lot. It's hard to find ones I like but these are pretty good. My only issue is that when tying them to the top the lace gets a tad shorter than I'd like and the tongue tries to take a dive."
"These are perfect. They are a little differant than pictured. very lightweight and comfortable to wear. The earpiece is straight across
not curved as shown in the picture. The gold is wearing off after only 3 times wearing these..."
"My husband does like this short as it is a well finished garment, although it is made with a very delicate fabric that will not last longer."
"This dress is really pretty, but I could not get it zipped. I ordered a size 14. I am just under 5'9"" & just under 200lbs. Measurements are 40x37x47. the length was not bad. I thought it was going to me longer on me, but a moderate heel would have sufficed. It is sheer on top. I had on a black corset body shaper while trying on & it didn't look bad underneath. Would have probably worked had I been able to zip up the dress."
"Loved it when I initially received it. So pretty but a few weeks into wearing it, it has started staining my skin. I've purchased several charms through Amazon and this is the first time I've had this happen"
"I have a pair of medium blue ""Samantha""  style size 4 bootcut jeans in my closet that I bought a while ago. Since then, I've lost about 5 pounds and the jeans themselves have simultaneously gotten a bit stretched out simply due to regular washing and wearing. And while I still do wear them occasionally, they're definitely more ""baggy and slouchy"" than ""fitted and flattering"" at this point. So when I saw the ""licorice"" (black) color ""Samantha"" jeans in a size 2 at a crazy-low price, I was so excited - and certain they'd fit - that I immediately bought 2 pairs.

Unfortunately, it seems either that Miraclebody has changed their jeans sizing entirely OR the ""licorice"" jeans were inexplicably cut larger than other colors in the ""Samantha"" style - because both size 2's I received are at least the same size as, and seemingly even slightly larger than, my older stretched-out size 4 pair!

Given that these new jeans were (or should have been) essentially the same jeans as the ones I already had and loved, it was a real disappointment. Regardless, I'm hoping those particular jeans were just a fluke manufacturing or labeling error (which might explain why they were being offered at such an unusually low price). The Miraclebody brand doesn't seem to be as widely available as it was a couple of years ago so I don't have any recent purchases for a size comparison, but I'm very tempted to spring for a pair in the ""Pacifica"" color and cross my fingers that they fit as expected. If so, I'll be back to update this review accordingly..."
"i was happy to get this until i see the side ripped.nice design, fits good, liked the material but i wasn't happy about the rip. (first time wearing it!)"
Nice flip flop if you can stand the bumps inside. I couldn't so I sent it back :(  Runs a little large too.  Good service and package was clean and new.
These are  ok. I really expected more support for a pair of shoes of this price. They seem to be nicely made though.
"I am between an 8 - 8.5. Ordered these in an 8.5..too big. The heel looks very cheap, but gave it 3 stars because the color is very pretty. found a problem with the wrapping of the heel..wrinkled and they are going back. Had my daughters try them on for an upcoming wedding or just for general wear. No one thought they'd ever wear them..same comment...the heel."
"I bought this to use with a costume.  The quality isn't great but it was cheap, so I wasn't expecting it to be great."
"It ran a bit small,  but worked."
"Jacket had a strong chemical/ leather smell when I took it out of packaging but dissipated by the next day. Jacket was too small for me in the chest area so I returned it. (Im a size small, 34DD) I ended up finding another one I liked more. Jacket does feel a bit cheap -but you get what you pay for.  if you are looking for a deal and don't want to pay hundreds for a genuine  leather jacket, this is it. It does run small through chest area so order up a size."
"Larger and much heavier than I anticipated. I own a 44mm Panerai, so I'm familiar with a larger and heavier case, but at 50mm those extra 6mm make a significant difference.  The blue markings on the dial weren't quite as bright as they appear on the listing.  Seems nicely finished and it's a nice timepiece, it just wasn't the right thing for me once I had it on.  Returned and credited promptly."
Again waiting for cold weather to get here to see how warm they will keep you.
These shoes are super cute. They have a nice thick memory foam foot bed which is nice but they are impossible to break in! I ordered a half size up and I have to wear bandages on the back of my heels every day because they rub the skin off my heels! I want to love them and maybe that will stop but I've worn them 4 days so far (10 hous per day) and they still hurt
I have a normal sized head and wanted a serviceable white hat for casual outdoors in the winter.  This is a nicely made hat of good quality but it does fit a little on the small size as though it was intended for a young teen.
No 9.5 available. I bought a 10 that runs too large :(
"I loved this, but the lining was loose and unless I sewed it it would have shown. Too bad because it was just what I wanted for my daughter's wedding"
"I'm a size 12 and while I could tie this around my waist, there wasn't much room left over for the draped look.  I also couldn't make it work more than one way due to the small size.  The quality was very nice, but if you're larger than a 12 on the bottom, I'd find a different sarong."
too small can not wear it. will not fit around me
This is your typical party store halloween costume for kids.  Mask is rubber and the costume is fabric.  I don't expect much out of it and hope he is able to wear it to school and trick or treat without messing it up too badly.  Any fall or knee slide will tear this thing immediately.  Not meant to be worn more than a couple times.  I would not buy this as a play outfit for your kid.
"The garment shrunk tremendously upon first wash, and I try to wash everything on gentle and dry on low heat."
"My wife said these look like shoes from Wal-Mart. I ordered a different color and hope they look better, but they look worse than in the photos. Will update review accordingly.

UPDATE: They look better in a different color. Definitely don't buy the light grey with white on the side. As for fit, these do run small. I normally wear an 11 and 11.5 in Nike (nike runs small), and ordered a 12 in these. They fit just right, very snug, ALMOST a tad small. Also, I don't like that these are not deeper. When I wear ""no show"" ankle socks, the tops of my socks show in these, unlike in other shoes. They are comfortable and light though. I'm not much of a runner, so I cannot speak to them for that."
I wished they looked as good in the person as they do on the website. Cheaply made could have been better quality.
"The shoes fit really well, however they looked very clunky and big on my feet and I wasn't a fan of the shiny leather. The shape is a bit strange too, narrow in the middle with a thicker heel. Sent them back!"
These run three sizes too small.  Made for Hobbits
"This is basically a rectangular piece of fabric frayed at the edges, but stylish and a good price."
He put it on immediately.
"The earrings are pretty, but they don't always stay close."
"I bought this bag because it was part of a lightning deal, and I got a good price for it. But I wish I'd never bought it. There were plenty of reviews that said the bag stinks on the inside - smells like fish. Not everyone had that complaint, so I took a chance. Well . . . mine STINKS! I've got tea bags in there to hopefully draw out the smell, but I checked it recently, after two weeks, and it still smells. I love the bag, and I really want to use it, but I get migraines and smells like that give me headaches. I'm going to try Febreze or something next. Hopefully, it works."
Product looks a little cheap
"They were really cute, but fit too tight and I did not keep them."
"loved that it was so versatile, was a great add for 4th of July. Took quite a while to receive though"
A little thin. Snags on things. But pretty much does the job.
These briefs are okay if you don't need a fly.
"Very short, slightly snug around the arms."
This was a bit tight and my other bras the same size fit fine. I like the color and style.
Again...Size does matter. It didn't occur to me that these were made for above ankle boots and that I was looking for slightly above the ankle zippers.  The product seems great though.
"These are comfortable, but I was expecting more cushion, support and quality. They are comfortable, but I don't think they're supportive enough for long days of walking which is what I am looking for. I wear an 8.5, but ordered a 9 since these don't come in half sizes. The straps fit fine because the back strap is adjustable, but the sole of the sandal was too long. Lastly, they didn't look new. One of the sandals was unbuckled, they weren't packaged neatly in the box, and there was a very noticeable scuff on the leather on one of the toe straps. I don't want to pay this much for sandals and question whether I got a brand new pair or a pair that someone tested out and then returned. And if they were brand new - the quality isn't very good."
"Well the slip is comfortable and light to wear, but I was disappointed that it doesn't help in make the skirt of my dress 'slip' smoothly over the fabric. So my skirt still gets bunched up a bit, which is frustrating since that is why I purchased this. Slips are a bit of a new venture for me, so maybe I'm missing something....:oP"
They feel nice but I ordered a Med. It says Small / Med. on inside. It is on the small side. I would get a Large to extra large if your shapely and 150 lbs. Also pretty thin. Waist seems a little loose.
"I'm not sure if career changed anything with these jeans, but I can buy them at the store and they fit different. I've been wearing 40x30 and 42x30s forever. Bought 42x30 tag says 42x30. They fit tighter than any of my 40x30s and the pocket openings are smaller. I can barely get my hands in there. Looks like I will be paying a couple dollars more from now on and picking them up at the store."
"I am a woman, but tried a men's shoe to get some width. Skechers are always too narrow in women's sizes for me. I thought this ""wide width"" size might work, but was disappointed and returned them. I love the styling and lightweight, though."
"With the title of the product saying ""Tall"" I assumed the product I would be purchasing for my 6'4"" boyfriend would be tall. Wrong. The 2x shirt I ordered him fits his shoulders and arms but barely grazes the top of his jeans. He's the type that likes to lift his arms above his head and not have his belly button on display. The fabric is quite soft though and seems to be very breathable so if it had been long enough it would have great for my warm-hearted oven of a guy :-)"
"A little snug all the way around.  I'm a true medium, size 8-10, and don't usually have any issues, but this was small.  Not un-wearable.  I had to pull on the let holes and break some of the seams to get it to feel more comfortable.  Seemed homemade.  BUT it did last all season and was a fun talking point.  Lots of compliments."
"I already own a Citysafe 200 (which I had to modify--see my review ""Coulda, shoulda, woulda"")&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pacsafe-CitySafe-200-Anti-Theft-Hand-Bag/dp/B000ZPR3FK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pacsafe CitySafe 200 Anti-Theft Hand Bag</a>, but I wanted something smaller for use around town and perhaps on shorter trips.

The Citysafe 100 has all the positives of the bigger 200 purse--steel wire in the handle, steel mesh in the body, well-constructed, heavy-duty fabric. But it is considerably smaller and lighter.

In fact, it is almost too small, and I must agree with other reviewers who wish Pacsafe offered something in-between the 100 and 200.

The outside end pockets on the 100 are so small and so tight that they are useless except for perhaps carrying pencils or pens. My very thin cell phone does fit--however, once in, it is hard to get out because the pockets are so tight.

There are no other outside pockets. The 200 has a large outside zippered pocket (actually divided by stitching into two useless small pockets, but the stitches can be removed.) This purse has nothing like that and that's too bad, because an outside pocket would allow you to carry tickets, brochures, coupons, etc.

As with the bigger 200, I am considering making some modifications to the 100, which would include mesh water bottle end pockets with cord locks. I did this to the 200 and it was very useful on a 10-day trip to Paris. But once again I'm wondering why I have to make such heavy-duty alterations on a new purse."
Does not stick well or push up the girls. I'm a D cup and see no difference when wearing them or removing them in my dresses
"I chose this rating since the hat is to large for my head and heavy.  The hat is a beautiful shade of red and the white trim is neat.
I found it is oversized for a woman's head and therefore doesn't look chic.  Rather heavy to wear for any amount of time."
"well, three stars only. i liked the design of the shoes, so i ordered them. this is looks like a good shoe that you could wear to a birthday party or similar sort. but not a comfortable shoe for everyday use or long hours. the edges of the shoe felt they were somewhat too sharp so bit uncomfortable. its ok for the price. and after attending the party its going back into my closet until i go to another party. lots of people complained about the smell. which is true. it has a very strong petroleum odor that may be too strong for some people. they shipped it on time and arrived on time. so i had like five days before the party so i let the smell subside. left it under the sun for half a day and that seemed to take away about 70% of the smell. Instead of paying few hundred for a shoe, this was ok, so not going to bother about the smell too much. Ferro Aldo shoes' design looked impressive thats the reason i bought these. I may buy another Ferro aldo shoe, but if they still smell and feel the same then I'd quit buying this ."
I've never been disappointed in anything I bought from Amazon...but I'd received so many praises about the comfort of these shoes I couldn't help but be disappointed that Sketchers seem to run a little small.  I wish I had waited to see if I could find the 10 1/2 advertised earlier...I'm sure I would be singing their praises too.
"Disappointed in the purse, especially for Kate Spade.  Shoulder strap is held by snaps inside the purse.  The holes were stretched out and the strap would not stay on purse.  Had to return for refund."
"I bought this to replace a worn out front-pocket wallet I have had for about 3 years.  I received this, and while it is nicely crafted, it is way to small to be functional for me.  My biggest issue was with cash storage.  The billfold area isn't deep enough for the paper bills to sit all the way down (doesn't matter if you use 1 bill or 10).  No matter what I tried, the long edge of the paper bills would stick out up to 3/16 of an inch outside of this wallet.  That made no sense to me, so I returned it for something a little bigger."
sizes are really not right.
"Too narrow in the toe area, no padding in the sole.... sent these back"
They did not hold my 8yr olds glasses snug on his face. The hang around the neck. However it is a nice strap if you are just looking to hold the around your neck.  Going to give to my friend how's 10 yr old has locks.  They will probably be snug on his head.
They get fuzzys on my feet. And lint all over the socks after washing.  Not the best quality. They're still cute though
I would buy a 1/2 size bigger. the shoes are beautiful though
"Great looking and great quality, but fits way small. Especially in sleeve length, but I just keep them up and it's not a problem."
"It wasn't what I expected because the hood was big and bulky and I could see the color of whatever I wore underneath the fleece, as it was lightweight.  I will keep looking..."
"It was actually really cute and decent quality. But, the S/M fits more like a M/L. :("
"I didn't pay attention to the size of these pendants and just assumed they would be ""normal"" size.  These are quite large for wearing around your neck, at least for me.  I have the OM pendant hanging from my mirror in my car and it looks fantastic!!  I'm sure I'll find other places to hang the other two. They are very shiny and colors are vibrant."
"The pants fit as expected and were really cute, but I wore them one time and the black leather part tore away from the pants at the seam on the calf area. The overall quality is not great. I understand that they were inexpensive, but I was hoping to get more than a couple wears out of them, especially since I like them so much."
The cork wedgeis a little funky with dark spot but the shoes are for casual beach days. The 7 1/2 is almost too small but the size 8 was too big.  It cost me $15 to return to ship the size 8.  And the shoes were not much more than that so I was not happy about it.
Posts are too thick to fit in ear lobes
The cloth is so soft and amazing but the Stitching isn't great.. I had to sew it at few places that opened up. Still works good.
The color was off was more pinkish than red.
"These sandals are of good quality, but not good as far as all day comfort. The worst thing about them is the heel which is not very steady due to it's cone shape. There is not adequate padding in the forefoot area and heel. I can't wait to throw them off my feet at the end of the day. Now I only wear them if I know I won't be walking much because I like the style.  I definitely won't be taking them on any trips!"
interesting dress. the waist is too big but can easily be altered. would be nice for the cooler months.
Perfect size for my 10 year old. The opal inlay is not as apparent as in the photo.
Liked the style but the fabric is too thin to support my 2x size.
"Very cute, in the box!  Flimsy, does not hold shape."
"Purchased these for my niece.  She is an average 4-year-old.  The bottoms fit fine, but the top was small.  She will not get a full winter's' wear out of the top."
Definitely not the same quality as Under Armour Crew socks I've purchased locally but decent.
Would reorder in wide width.
It is comfy but gets wrinkled easily.
Fits good and quality is good but even for walking in March and April (15 degree of Celsius) it's very hot for feet. It's my first pair of Nike and expected more than I get
These are very cute but they don't stay in place.  They slowly slip down the back of your head
"I got this as a birthday gift, per my wish list and I have to say I was quite disappointed.  It is not very flattering...it made me think of an inmate jumpsuit - the fabric is rough, it is baggy, the shorts are very long (not as pictured) and over all it just looked like a potato sack on me.  I ordered my regular size but it seems too baggy - maybe if it were a smaller size might help but even then, there's just no ""cuteness"" to it so I am going to return it."
"After research i found that i ended up getting one of the heavier material shirts, and its too big. i wear a medium-sized shirt, needed a small. If you are looking for the lighter materials, go with bahama or tamiami. maybe you won't sweat like i did..."
The bow tie was huge practically the size of the babies head. The hat was the best part. Over all decent for the price but the bow tie can't really be used it's way too big for anything
"I liked this shirt ... until I washed it.  It shrunk so much that I had to give it to a friend who is smaller than I am.
Other than that, it's cool."
Pretty but wanted thenm bigger.
These leggings run small.  I should have gotten a size bigger than usual.
Too tight in the arms and the collar will not lay down.
Hemmed them and like the fit.
"We have to separate the jacket from the customer service. The jacket is all they said it would be. I like it. However, I was SHOCKED at SCOTTeVest's CEO's social media post. He called conservatives who bought ScotteVests ""f...ing conservative...idiots.""  I was now embarrassed and angry and didn't want to wear the jacket that I paid $174.00 for.

I called customer service yesterday (Feb. 6) and the customer service lady apologized for their CEO ""who was not longer with us"" and quickly attempted to rush me off the phone. I said, ""wait, wait...why are you rushing me off the phone?"" and she started yelling at me (yes, the call WAS recorded for 'customer service improvement') and when I tried to talk to her further, SHE HUNG UP ON ME.  This morning I attempted to ""chat"" online line with their ""vest expert"". She apologized for their ""no longer there CEO"" and then suggested that I should talk to that CEO. She proceeded to give me his email address (Scott@scottevest.com) showing that he is still at the company - or why would he have that email address?  I asked that the present CEO needs to write to every customer who purchased a jacket or vest who was offended. However, now I am supposed to write to their ""no longer there"" CEO. Sense my frustration? I now have an expensive jacket that reminds me of a very rude and ineffective CEO and customer service."
"I sent these back. They are decent, but the ankle is a little stiff and small. The Henry Farrera option was a better style in my opinion."
"It is a nice looking polo shirt, very form fitting and looks great if you have a slimmer or athletic build like the model in the picture. However, the material is not very durable and after a year of light use one of the buttons has already fallen off on the gray one I had bought along with this one. I can still wear the polo because it looks fine even with a missing top button, but I'm pretty sure that if I had worn this polo more regularly I would have gotten rid of it by now due to wear."
I like the flap over the cleavage.  Fits really snug but it works.
"I bought it for my husband, who practically is a mosquito attractant, we live in an area near the ocean, and there are many mosquitoes. He uses it but still needs to use insect repellent, using only the shirt isn't enough, mosquitoes can still bite through the fabric -"
"My daughter is small and a boys 12 or 14 would normally swim on her but this just barely fit.  It would correctly be sized a girls 12 or boys 10.  The elastic waste with out stretching it measures 23"" and the inseam from crotch to leg end is 24"".  Needless to say it is short on her.  The front cover says the model is 52"" and 61 pounds.  This is what you need to see if the Large will fit your child."
"Very high waste, and quite large, but they can be cinched. Really good fit in the legs (for a slim child). Soft and stretchy material."
Nice shoes very comfy on the bottoms of the feet but just a little to small around the toes. Had to painfully break them in a few days and still wear bandaids to help. I do have very flat feet though. But besides that I like these shoes
"3 stars because while the set looks good and feels good on the finger, the rock in the engagement ring is not set properly and actually audibly rattles in the setting."
"These are so cute, but the strap that goes across the foot, is too tight for my 18 month old's fat foot. She is in a size 3 right now (had to purchase a size 4 as it was the smallest available), but even being a size too big, they were too tight due to the strap. My older daughter likes the other crocs similar to this, where the strap is diagonal. I may try those as it fits my older daughters foot perfectly."
Cute but runs small. Had to order 1/2 larger.
"It would probably be just fine if it were not so tight around my stomach, but I won't wear it."
Great quality shoe but the M+ is just to narrow. I normally wear medium width in U.S sizes. Previous to these I ordered medium and returned. Reordered M+ hoping for better fit (no luck) to narrow through mid foot.
The pieces all feel like they're different sizes
"Very pretty, but need to be careful when putting these on.  The metal on the posts is very soft and bends easily."
"Fits pretty well in the waist, however the inseam is ridiculously long. No need for these to go down to my knees..."
"They don't match up to the 501's I have that I've boughten in stores, material is a lot thinner ! Not near as rugged.. fingers crossed they last stand up to the old ones.."
Ended up returning them because they look like men's shoes.  Just not my personal preference.
"Given the price and quantity - they met expectations, but nothing special"
"I thought these boots were pretty cute, but they also look a bit on the cheaper side. The material doesn't seem too durable, and the boots themselves aren't super comfortable. I ended up sending them back. However, they're not expensive at all, so you get what you pay for!!"
I can't really rate these - I should have read the description closer - I was looking for a lined boot - I may have to return them
"I end up drenched after my workout.  Found a Saucony shirt that is much better even though it's not a tank.  I don't even wear this Champion anymore, just sits in my closet."
"Snagged easily and ran a little small. Other than that, these were for a one time use."
Bag has feet to save the material on the bottom which is good. The material itself looks study but feels a bit like plastic and not material or luggage like as I expected ... the good news is you could wipe it down and since we'll be using it for art supplies to take back and forth - it was fine.
This was purchased for a friend and we got one size larger based on the bust size from reading previous reviews. She wears is a 38C-D. I loved this style on her but having the dress alone on a larger woman I think the short cardigan makes the outfit. I also like the wide blue belt to break up the floral print.  The material is a thick material and was made well. There were no strings showing or any badly seen areas.
"These are CRAZY LONG.  I tried giving them to my 6'7 brother, and they were even too long for him.  Also they make a swishy noise when you walk."
Should have fit but did not
"Bigger than I thought, but well made and comes with extra backings."
Fits and was relatively inexpensive so I'm keeping it.  I have not worn to the pool yet.  But the quality could be a little better. (See picture.  This is the top strap so is very visible.)
Great shirt but way too bug. Had to send back.
Seems poorly made. I sent back. Don't think they'll last long.
I ordered my usual size 16Petite Short.  They were quite baggy and too long.  Wish I could figure out how to return them.  There was no packing slip to identify the item for return.
"a little tight,beautiful shoe"
"You get what you pay for.  These are OK,  but not the best quality,  tho I am enjoying wearing them in this hot summer weather.
Not sorry I bought them."
These are my seventh pair of Danskos. Theyre just adorable! Its the color that makes them modern funky.  The length is fine but I have a thinner foot so Im going to have to add a shoe insert to the foot bed to fill up the space otherwise the arch side of the shoe is far too high and cuts into my ankle. I have wanted these shoes for a long time and I didn't expect to have to do that. Otherwise these would be a 5.
I bought a large size for my husband it was too small for him but just right for my 12 years old son
"warmth is good ..material is good ..but runs small..i gave it to my son ,,he wears a one size smaller than me..order a size up and you will be fine ."
I thought that they would have better bottoms on them. Overall soft and keeps your feet warm. Throw in the wash and clean. Was expecting at least a flat bottom/
I love the color and the way it fits. so cute!
"I normally wear a size 7, but I got the 6.5M because I wear these without socks and they fit perfect.  I didn't like that in the picture they have the shoe ties tucked away so you cannot see them.  To me, in the picture, it just looks like an x shape for the shoe ties, but that isn't the case.  They are actual shoes that you have to tie. Disliked that!"
"The pants and too big and the top is too small :/ It's cute otherwise, just doesn't fit well on my slim daughter."
"Good fabric, seems like it would hold up well. Definitely a cargo cut with wide legs. I returned it as the ""Romeo 6 pocket Flare"" bottoms I ordered were a more flattering fit."
"Cute mini-backpack, perfect size to use in place of a handbag.

However, i wish the straps were padded."
I have been spoiled by the quality of L a s p o r t i v a brand boots.  They seem to run about a half size small.  These are very light weight boots and simply have not stood up as well as the other brand I have been used to wearing.  I would not buy these again.
These sunglasses don't protect  UVs.
"Really liked this suit.  I ordered the XXL.  I'm 38in around the hips.  The bottom fit perfectly.  The top, however is not proportioned to the bottom.  It was a size or two smaller.  There is no support in the bra, so there was no way to work the top to fit.  I returned the suit."
"runs alittle large just have to break them the hardest part very cute, nice colors good alround house or garden shoe"
I suggest buying one size larger than you typically would for a better fit.
"Cute, simple dress. It is not thick material, so If you are expecting a nice, warm winter dress, this is not the one. My granddaughter loves this dress."
It was ok. It needed to stretch a bit more in the arm area.
"High quality? Absolutely. But...

The handle needs to be larger and/or repositioned. The blades don't touch the skin between my knuckles. In other words, it doesn't look like the blades are coming out of my hand. I can do some custom fabrication but it isn't optimal. Also the blades are all evenly spaced and straight. It would be better if they were slightly pointed away from each other at the tips.

Otherwise pretty good."
This dress looks pretty but unfortunately fits very snug. Like at least 1 size too small. Had to return.
"I like the weight, and look, but the zippers are hard to operate(over the corners) and the storage is minimal at best."
Runs large and after wearing a while they got even bigger. I can't wear them. I tried inserts but it makes them too tight at the top of my vamp.
a bit smal but wear with thin socks and it is okay. I would suggest ordering up.
This robe is cute but very short. Perfect for lingerie but thats about it.
Cute top but pricey for fabric quality.  Also sizing always seems to be a gamble depending on the piece.
Gold toe socks aren't what they used to be.
They are ok but look a little cheap.
"I wish I'd read the GUIDE on fitting, INSTEAD of most of the reviews stating is was too small! I'm usually size small, 34-28-24 and due to the reviews claiming the corsets ran SO SMALL, I ordered 2 sizes up, a large. The darn thing was huge! I suggest you go with the sizing guides, cause for me the reviews on here failed. As for the other aspects of the corset, if was nice enough, I didn't like the bows, it made it looks cheap. The tule was a nice addition. The dark blue was a lighter blue and also didn't care for that.  I returned it for a smaller size in black"
"The footbeds are terrific, as always. I do not like the straps though. They are uncomfortable and have not gotten better in the 2 months I've worn them. I have 4 current pairs of birks and know how to adjust them properly. These cannot be made comfortable on the top of my foot."
"Bought the Toto, which is my third pair ordered through Amazon. All three were the same size/style, just different colors and they ALL fit differently.

I really like the style, color and the length is perfect. The fit around the waist is a killer! I don't know if I should have gone up two sizes. Try them on at a store before ordering online."
These were not my favorite from the maker. Colors don't really look as good as pictured. Wish other colors were avail at the time. Might have worked out.... Shoes Tim a bit wide all around.
They fall down a lot. Not what I had expected
"This isn't constructed like one that I have from 30 years ago.
Its just not built to last.
But, it works well,, now."
"The same size as my other bibs, but fits tighter."
"Tons of pockets, durable, and many features.  I'm a short person and these didn't fit so well.  They're also a bit thick and too hot for warm weather."
"Is somewhat large, very soft and comfy, I am giving it 3 stars because it started pilling after 4 times I wore them."
Nice but you need to be short to use then handle and wheels.
The boot looks great and I love the gray color. BUT the footbed is so uncomfortable it's like walking barefoot on cement. I considered getting inserts but in the end decided to return them because they were a bit snug in the calf over my jeans. Perfect for leggings or very skinny jeans though.
"THE shoes are tight, I expect they may stretch out over time with usage.  I can squeeze into them so I am not sending them back since I am located overseas...returns can be such a hassle.

They look great!  If I had not pulled up on my bike no one might have guessed they were bike shoes.
  I added the clips and they function fine and very adjustable so no matter how you prefer to set your foot on the pedal you can make the right adjustments."
Left shoe felt like a size smaller...sending back.
"Fabric is nice and soft, I bought this to use under a sheer shirt, and this does work as an underlayer so I will wear it. Fit seems to be fine. I like the racerback style because it stays where it's supposed to as opposed to scoop front and back tanks.

The arms, neck and hem are serged edges which look cheap (but at least they lay flat). Even though it was ""only"" $10-11 delivered, this seems pricey for a very thin fabric undershirt. The ivory fabric was definitely see-through and would not work worn on its own, and would just look like a cheap tank top - which is what it is.

The fabric garment label is of a more robust fabric than the shirt and annoyed me sufficiently to cut it off.

Here is a question for the maker of these tanks. I wonder if the following is reasonable:
I have been looking for a good tank for use as an underlayer for some time. I took a chance on this out of desperation, a blouse I bought was too sheer to wear without that underlayer. I have never been able to figure out why what is basically an undershirt that guys can get in a 3-or 4-pack for almost nothing has to be so much more expensive when it's made for a woman. This garment's construction costs have to be pretty inexpensive - the fabric, cutting, serging, that's about all there is to it... but I paid $10 for it while it weighs maybe 4 oz. and it arrived in a small envelope. It's not as though tank top styles change that much, and when it's essentially a perennial item - a shirt like this should come in multiple packs to be useful. If it was available in multi packs I would love to see a 3- or 4 pack - which I would likely pay say $25 for .... that seems a reasonable price for something that looks so simple to produce."
"I just want to start with saying that this bag is durable as well as stylish, and I do love this bag. Unfortunately, due to the way this bag opens, it is not easily accessible. I find myself just dumping everything out of the bag on a regular basis just to grab my wallet or makeup bag.

The flap that attaches to the side of the bag makes it awkward to reach into the bag to grab stuff out. Also, the dimensions make it narrow and long, which doesn't allow for much room to search around inside of the bag.

So, if you are looking for a bag to use daily as a purse or messenger bag, and have more than just the minimal amount of items to carry around, I wouldn't suggest this bag.

But, if you are looking for something to carry around books, notepads, or an iPad, this would make a long-lasting, reliable bag."
"I can't tell if this shirt wasn't a good cut overall or just wasn't a good cut on me. The neckline and shoulder area was too wide, so I felt like I was constantly pulling the neck in so it wouldn't show my bra straps. The dolman part under the armpits really sagged, so it took away from my shape and made me look apple-shaped since my waist was filled in with extra fabric- I had no curves. The fabric was thin and the gray felt lighter than I wanted. All around it looked drab and droopy. I returned the product but had a smooth return process. I really like this brand and have rated some of the other items I've bought high, so maybe it was just this shirt on me."
"I wish it had a bra insert,,,,"
The sandal is comfortable but does not have the arch support like other Cobb Hill shoes.
"Lovely jumper, but too small. I ordered a size up and it was still too small."
"I like the way the shoe looks on my foot, but the shoe fits to loose because of the elastic fit."
"Seems to be a good product overall, but I just wasn't' sure about the durability of the outside material. Ended up returning and getting the Delsey Chatlet luggage instead!"
"I'm still trying the shoes - to see if putting some ""bulk"" under the tops will make them fit tight enough to keep.
I may have to return them."
Runs smaller then it says
Had to return... Runs way too big
"It's not very well constructed, but it does serve the purpose I got it for - taking pictures to frame items. Not the best, but you could do worse."
"The comment title says it all: for a slip-on shoe, it's just too loose for narrow feet. I really would have kept since they are good looking."
show alot of chest
"This is much bigger than expected and is not very feminine at all, even with all of the feminine detail.  I would not buy this product again!"
"I wish the belts on these shorts was attached somehow; I had to confiscate the belt because my kiddos were trying to use it as a leash - on an arm thankfully, but better safe than sorry!!"
"I really liked this bra, but for some reason it felt like it was going to slip up all the time. I think it was just too big. was returned."
"I like the idea of this watch more than the reality, alas. I'd been looking for a casual watch that I could wear on weekends or out on casual occasions, something that didn't have sparkle or glitz and went with a jeans and t-shirts look. This fit the bill -- but wearing it just didn't prove that comfortable and trying to use it for its intended purpose hasn't been that simple.

As far as the feel and looks/wearability goes: I love the strap, which is thick and yet comfortable. It's nice to find a strap that is this comfortable, although I think that it's a bit short: I have a relatively thin wrist (on bracelet watches, I usually have to have pieces removed and the fastening adjusted) and yet this watch is fastened on the next to last hole, with no room for additional holes to be made. Something to consider for people with thick wrists. I did find the watch as a whole on the heavy side to wear, and when I had to change the time (flying back and forth from Chicago) I had a lot of trouble with the knob not doing what it was supposed to. More significantly for me -- and this is a subjective issue -- I found the broad contrasting stripes actually bothered me when I was trying to read the time. The hands of the watch are so narrow that they kind of got lost in the big stripes, and I occasionally struggled to tell the time, and wound up pulling out my phone to verify that I had gotten it right. Several times, I hadn't.

So this will take a back seat among my watches for the time being. I've been wearing it only occasionally, and pulled it out to wear again recently to be sure I had given it a fair try. I had..."
"I love the look of this skirt, however, the tulle underlay felt like window screening.  It was uncomfortable to wear and the top layers actually stuck to it when you move.  I cut the underlay out and the skirt worked much better."
"Love, love htis item!! fits perfectly, great feel and look!!!
it gives me free movement yet dries really fast after my workout!"
The regular medium is too short and the tall I have bought elsewhere is too long
Nice belt but not true to size.  Much longer than expected.
I got a second pair because the first ones were defective....Still not right
Nice boots just to narrow  !
These are thin. They aren't double lined.
its weary small for size 36 eu
The quality is not great. After a week of use one of the clips of the laces fell off.
"Honestly can't say how it fits. My father needs 2 pocket flannel tops so he can carry his cell in one and his glasses in another. I order this and then found it in another store way, way cheaper. Granted though, I am sure this top was probably heavier and nicer quality. But I never took it out of it's pkg to find out. Just shipped it back."
"My daughter loves pink and I liked that this backpack is highly visible. No one else has one in this eye-blinding pink color.

What I don't like is that one of the 2 main zippers repeatedly gets the fabric of the backpack edge stuck inside it. My husband has to fix it, it's difficult for even me to fix. This is some type of a design flaw, as the simple back and forth use of the zipper causes this to happen."
"It fits OK, but too flat in the bust area, I guess it's OK for the money I paid. But I would recommend it to anybody."
Love the color but somewhat small than my other pair of blue jeans
"I've purchased southpole jeans from a retailer near my home before.  I saw that it was about $20 cheaper on amazon, so my intuition was to order it.  When received, it fit just as I assumed it would.  Only problem I have is the zipper is very hard to zip up or down.  It's as if i need to use WD40 on it or something.  Otherwise I'm happy with the jeans."
"My girlfriend says I look pretty sexy in them but I feel bare and as good as naked. I personally don't like that but that's just my preference. If you have great bod that you WANT to show off (unlike me) go for it.

In addition, this outfit is really thin and elastic."
"Did not care for the quality of these, so I returned them and bought the Ziplock brand pack at Costco."
"Looks ok for cosplay, but I really wouldn't try walking with it a whole day."
"This lipstick went on well, felt good going on, and lives up to the hydrating claim, but it didn't last as long as expected.

My one real complain is the color.  The color (as viewed on my computer which I know can vary) looks like a rich pinkish plum color, but when I wore it it was much more vibrant and hot pinkish and had more of a matte finish instead of a sheen or gloss.  I generally buy colors similar to Whitney so it was a bit of a shock and disappointment when trying this one on.  I guess I also assumed that since it was hydrating that it would have a subtle sheen to it....not necessarily a gloss but not a matte either.

I don't think I'll be getting lipstick online again because there are just too many color variations."
Sharp latch cuts into hand
You get what you pay for. Don't expect this to replace your expensive $un glasses
was hoping it would looser
"Nice length both covering fanny and over the wrists.  HOWEVER - I have a woman's shape which no longer looks really great with the ""shaping"" that is in every darn shirt and coat anymore.  Am thinking that I will start buying men's - they don't have to worry about not having a waist:-)"
I should have known the it would run small by a size. It seems like online clothes always do. Disappointing because the item looks well made. I was really disappointed.
"Not a bad product to purchase. I brought this for my 16 year old cousin and she loved it. I kept the smaller bag for my cards and change and to this day in 2017 its still in perfect condition. No pieces have fell off and color still looks fine. Three pieces for that price, was a steal. I would defiantly suggest this product for a gift, especially for someone younger or anyone who isn't so concerned with name brands."
It is ok it's not bad not great. Would I purchase again yes if to be worn as a pinkie ring not wedding finger but that's just MY taste.
Seems a little small or tight. But feels like good fabric
"I'm sorry to say that I'm somewhat disappointed in these panties. While the color & finish of the fabric is as seen in the picture, I'd be willing to venture this model's wearing an XL. I'm underweight right now (about  5'5"", 105-110 lbs), and per the manufacturer's advice ordered the Medium. While they technically fit, they aren't very flattering. They stretch some  - and maybe it's because I don't have a rock hard body - but mostly they kind of lightly dig and don't quite cover the rear area on me like they do on the model to a flattering effect. My husband likes them on me but I don't feel comfortable or attractive in them. My recommendation: unless you have major yoga booty you might want to skip these for something more flattering."
"I did not receive the item in the photo.  The shoes that I received had a Velcro closure on the outside of the toe straps.  I have read another review where the customer had the same problem.  They looked exactly the same otherwise, but this gave the shoe somewhat of a ""granny"" look.  I would have tried to make it work, but the Velcro on the ankle and the toe strap was too abrasive and difficult to adjust.  I was disappointed because this shoe was a nice height, and wide enough to walk in and wear all day comfortably. I'm typically a 10/41 (danskos) and could have gone down a half size, but it wasn't an option.  I returned the shoes.  I'll have to try again for a more youthful sandal from clark's."
"Its clear that this dress was made for a thin, fit muscle-less person. While the blue was nice, it also felt cheaply made (some threads came loose at the wrists upon first wash). It's wearable for a some-what chubby person (or someone who just has a rounder stomach) but it loosk best with a long vest or something over it."
it wasn't as comfortable as the other reviewers posted.
This would have been perfect IF I received the correct colored bras.... Instead I received a duplicate of another bra and not the navy one I requested.
"I loved this coat when I saw it online and it looks the same in real too. Good quality and lovely color and design and pretty warm too. BUT it's not the same size as mentioned, it runs large. Had to return it as they didn't have anything smaller than Small size :("
"I really wanted to love these shoes, I like the look and the suede, but for some reason the interior fabric just rubbed my feet raw!! I have other Go Walks that don't do that at all, and I've tried some on that do, so I guess it's kind of a crap shoot with these shoes. I'd be nice if there was more consistency, but everyone likes something different so it is what it is. I can certainly see why people love these shoes, they are comfortable to walk in (step-wise), plain, and cute. But they just didn't work for my apparently tender feet. I typically wear a 6 in Go Walks, and the 6 fit just fine, so I'd say order your normal size. So sad to return them!"
"I was expecting this to be more like a dress, since that's what the description says... but it's actually a shirt with a tulle ""tutu"" attached.  It's too short to be worn as a dress.  Looks very cute with pink leggings like in the photo, though!  Part of the tulle tutu was sewn to itself, so I had to carefully pull it apart.  This left a little snag on the tutu, but it's barely noticeable.  Overall, I am mostly happy with this item.  It looks adorable on my daughter, who wears between a size 5-6.
I was also hoping the barrette that was included would be a Peppa Pig barrette, but it was actually a knock-off Hello Kitty barrette."
My husband looked on my list and ordered this dress for me. However this dress pictured is not what arrived. Instead a different dress with a tight scrunched skirt and a scoop neck arrived. I was stunned and even went back to check what he ordered to make sure it wasn't my husbands mistake. It wasn't
"Had to return because it was too large,  also brim is too big to wear in the pool,  but good quality and color."
"These are huge  had to give them to my son.  Not the sellers fault,  just make sure you check the sizes before ordering"
"We ordered for my granddaughter for Easter.  She LOVED them, but they were too small.  She was able to get them on, but they were crushing her toes at the end.  I also ordered a size 13 for my younger granddaughter and hers fit fine - maybe a little bit on the large side.  Overall, the look is awesome.  I gave three stars only because they didn't fit the older girl as I expected.  As to looks, time of receipt, ease of return, all that was super great."
"Amazon does not provide a sizing chart for these shirts - sleeve length, neck, etc.  As such you are just guessing.  We returned it for a different size.  The shirt appears to be good quality, including an elastic button on the neck."
I ordered the XXL which should have fit according to the chart. They were a little snug.  I have found that Capezio products tend to run a little small.  Everything else about these tights is amazing. They stretch and wear well. the transition is easy from footed to non footed.
Awesome quality but it's a small fit. So if you have large wrists I'd pass on this one.
The material is of low quality and very thin
"I have finally worn through my old Merrell Jungle Mocs nursing shoes. So I called up Merrell shoes and clicked on white. The aluminum is not white. I will say that for the brief period that I had these on they were amazingly comfortable. But I can't wear silvery shoes on the floor. They're coming back, but I'm replacing them with another Merrell shoe."
"The open toe area wound up being uncomfortable because it crimped my toes.  I would skip these, and just buy the 'sleeve' compression socks."
Fit is smaller than sizing would suggest.
"Unlike the poly tanks by Pitbull, this one is cotton, which it clearly shows in the description.  The cotton is soft, as expected.  It looks okay, but the fit is just not as nice as the poly tanks.  Medium is big enough with plenty of room to spare for 200# guy with 10% bf."
My fianc wears 9.5 10 and when I bought 10 it was too close
will not dry it
"If it had fit I totally would be keeping it.  It is cute 50s style dress but it is also a 50s sizing chart because there is no way that this in an xl in today standards.  You can't go off the amazon chart on this.  I am having to return it as there is no larger size available.  I would say maybe the xl would fit a ladies size 10, maybe.  I received this as a promotional test product at a discounted price to test out and review.  This is my limited and unbiased opinion."
"Its cute, fits me in my waist, but omg my poor breasts. They were trying to escape into my armpits. I'm 5'5"", 160lb with a full D cup and it fit everywhere except the top part. the cups are made for women with smaller breasts. My chest looked sad with this thing on which kind of stinks because it wasn't cheap and it's super cute."
Lining comes out of the bra in washer. They are okay.
"Very very wide.i have wide, but they are double wide."
Cute but too narrow. Seemed to be more narrow than any other Sanuks I've had. Had to send back.
These shoes are comfortable but run really small. You must go up almost a extra size and a half to be comfortable.
"Not large enough, needed larger size but was not avaible"
these boxes are very small should have read the dimensions but even so I was able to make use for them.
"These shoes are not red! I ordered red patent and it is more like burgundy brown. So I cant use them for what I wanted because I needed red. I will keep them in case I need a burgundy brown shoe. I don't recommend the red. They fit ok. Also not sure if they are new, they have some marks on them. Just disappointed about the color."
not what i was looking for. would prefer a little smaller
Cute watch for casual days. Is a little big on me but I have small wrists and most watches have to have quite a few links removed in order to fit me properly. Good watch if you're looking for something different.
"The shirt fit is around average/healthy/sort of slim but not skinny and material is good and solid and the Marina Blue looks nice.

However... the bottom of this shirt is too long, it is almost like a dress if you don't tuck it in. Now some guys may enjoy wearing a short dress out in public but not me, I have to tuck it in to keep things looking somewhat presentable."
"Nice dress, moderate quality, fits well, overpriced. Semi-thin cheaper quality fabric for the price. Not see-thru and if your trim you can get away with wearing this without shapewear, this dress will require seemless panties though."
It's a little smaller espevilly the shoulder.
not crazy about it  would not reorder
"These are cute, but they ran large on the front of the foot and front is not adjustable."
looks nice but clips could be stronger
"The S is way to big for me.
Nice bold colors.  True to size.  S of an iron on type."
Fits ok. Just very thin fabric was used to make this dress. You can actually see right through it. It is very pretty fabric though.  My great-granddaughter loved it!
"My wife got this for me to use as a wedding band... I wore it one day and then we got something else. The ring is super thin and wide. It was uncomfortable for me to wear it. It also looked and felt really cheap, which it is."
surprising that these shoes ran small since other jambu sandals were so large that pads were needed to keep the foot from shifting
Good replacement laces for hiking boots
"These are tooo small unless that is what you need. One wash and they shrunk up to
fit a baby doll."
"Like the hat, but it keeps slipping up off my head!"
look cheap and are too big
"It is larger than most front pocket wallets.  Also the it shines like patent leather, not like most most carbon fiber wallets."
Beautiful boot but had to give them away because they were way too small like two sizes too small
"Have purchased about 5 Ben Sherman Tailoring shirts, all slim fit, same size. Strange at how much of a difference there is with the fit. Although I really like the pattern, fits a little large, resembling a full fit shirt."
Not as soft as I like.
After only few months starting to wear off
"I'm a 34A and ordered a small, and it was too big in the bust. Otherwise, it's a great top. The sleeves are extra long, which I love."
this shoe was a little tight. also i didn't know it was shiny .. i don't like shiny shoes. but i still kept them.
"Very, very thin; but I'll keep them because I don't want to re-order bigger ones or wait for the item to be shipped."
"I think this wallet is great for younger people. I find it too small for most of my notes and extra cards. I love the print and the design, but my complaint is that it's so shiny that it looks really cheap. Like cheap PVC. If you are after something in a StarWars theme in a good quality, I would recommend checking out Loungefly x StarWars wallets. That is so much better. Cheers."
Shoes were fine. Not as comfortable as the name implies though. I returned them though because the sole made them very slippery on my wood floors and the floors at work.
"This brush is okay, but not great. the handle is flimsy and the brush is small. Not what I was expecting."
I liked this corset however I ordered a Small and received a medium and it's ok quality. It still fit okay but a little bigger than expected since I received the wrong size. The fabric on the top halter area is very thin and stretches easily. I bought this item at a discount in exchange for a review and I don't think I would buy from them again.
A beautiful shoe but very high heeled.
a little long in the sleeve
So much dye used in this top it gave me a rash. After soaking the excess dye out it's a flattering tunic. I call it a tunic because I'm short & it's long enough for me to wear just with leggings and boots.
"The underneath is a bit short but the lace flows past that perfectly. You will definitely need a slip because the bottom is definitely see through but its very pretty, similar to the picture bit not exact"
Love this design but the clasp is very uneven and sometimes does not want to open to take off.
"havent worn it anywhere yet, i tried it on and when taking it off, one of the clasps dislodged."
"Order one size down! I ordered a size 6 since based on reviews, it fits true to size. Not at all! Also, not very comfortable."
I was disappointed when I received this shirt.  It is very thin and very light but the tag says other wise.  It is still an ok shirt and I would recommend this item.  I wear a  XXL and I ordered a XXL and it is pretty big on me.  It may shrink a little after I wash it.
"All three shirts in the package had several loose threads around the neck area which had to be trimmed.  One shirt came with a small hole in the front about the size of a small pea.  Looked like a snag or something.  Shirts fit well before washing, after washing they shrink quite a bit."
These are decent slippers for getting out of the shower - or just wearing around the house
BUT ... I thought this was in an adult size.  I do not blame the seller.  I was not paying attention.
Didn't look nice on me. To squared.
"The elastic on the waist is very uncomfortable. Kind of cuts into my waist. I like the look and flow of the skirt, but don't like the fit of the thin elastic, I have to keep moving it up and down (waist line/hip line) throughout the day. Happy to get home after work and take this off."
"No problems yet, had to tighten screws to keep band from falling off"
"I was so excited to get this bag, but it unfortunately did not meet my needs at all. The shape and style are very cute and I immediately threw the short strap over my shoulder and looked in the mirror. As cute as I hoped! The bag is not too large or cumbersome, but has tons of room inside. Now for the issues: I started transferring things from my previous bag, and nothing fit quite right! The top of the bag is so much more narrow than the bottom that as things sunk into the main compartment, the bag became misshapen and more difficult to zip. Then the cute shoulder strap would not stay out of my way to fix the placement of things inside. If you are not wanting to carry a 32 oz or larger water bottle and a tablet, this bag will probably work for you, but it didn't for me. I sent it back and got a different haiku bag with a shape that works more for me. Love haiku and their high quality, cute bags!"
"With the Clarks name, expected wider on an M width. Not."
"These fit slightly big, I am a TTS 6.5 and probably could have got away with a 6. These are cute boots but I dislike how the back of the heel sticks out, it looks funny. I'm only 5'3"" and these weren't too tall, the shaft height it perfect. I didn't even mind that weren't real suede and were kind of cheap looking. Unfortunately I cannot wear them anymore because they FALL DOWN! I wore them twice with no problem and got tons of complements but now they fall down to my knees. They stretch out very easily and now I cannot even wear them because they don't stay up! They look quite funny all bunched up in the leg."
Unfortunately I cannot feel this item provide enough support.
Collar is high in the back.  Sleeves are hard to roll up...narrow.  Good quality material.  Recommend ordering a size up.
"I ordered a large do to my ddd, but it was slightly too big so I couldn't wear it, it's so cute"
Needs more support even with making the bow extra tight just does not give much support
"Laces wore quickly and were too short, they barely tied into a bow when the foot was in the shoe. Good cushion and stability once the laces were replaced."
More dark than I expected
They are ok they are kind of tight and hurt my head made small.  I will have to try to find another pair that fit me better.
Ok. But not what I expected .
"There are some things I love about these, but also some things that I'm experiencing as I start to wear them that I think are good to pass along.  So today is the first day I have worn these.  I really like that they cover my foot and weren't slipping all day.  I have a wider width foot, and previous brands of this type of liner I bought were always slipping or pulling off of the heel.  This does have a gel type lining on the inside of the heel that probably helps keep it into place, but I also think that they elastic around the opening matters as well.  It tends to fit a bit snug.

As another reviewer has noted, these are going to be very visible in your flats.  So if that bothers you, then perhaps keep looking.  For me, I just really don't like the feel of sweaty feet in my flats, so I'm not about to go barefoot in any closed toed dress shoe really.  Not to mention, experience tells me that leads to stinky feet and stinky shoes, neither of which I enjoy.  So I place a higher priority on these staying on my feet then being invisible. And honestly, one of the amazing blessings that's come to me as the mom of a special needs kiddo is that I no longer care what people think about how I look in my clothes.  Standing in a dance studio waiting to pick your daughter up covered in puke will surely do that to you, among other things.  So I'm not really bothered by that so much, so it's an FYI for you.

The reason I took stars off is that after one day of wearing these, there is already considerable wear visible to the areas contacted by the shoes shown in picture one.  Those shoes, by the way, are wide width, and they are not in any way, shape, or form snug across the top of my foot.  My life needs shoes that I can walk, stand, etc. comfortably in all day long.  The fabric is pilled up, thinned out, and showing signs of distress in those areas.  The top side of the pilling is shown in picture two.  Also, in case you are sensitive to such things, note the pinkish red line where the sock has shifted as I moved my foot to take the picture.  These things grip enough to leave a mark, indent and color wise.  So again, if that's something that bothers you, it's something to be aware of.  It didn't really cause me any issues where I noticed it during the day, but someone with sensory issues or skin sensitivities might.

So while I love that I didn't spend all day pulling these up, they are showing enough signs of distress to indicate they are not going to be so durable.  So it's probably a good thing I won't be wearing flats too much in the summer months..."
"These are OK for what I paid for.  They are not high quality, but sufficient for banging around the house"
It's lightweight and comfy which is great but it really doesn't hold you in or give you smooth lines. It's kind of like pantyhose. But it is very comfy.
I love the length and the shine of these earrings. The back clasp has already began to loosen but they are still secure.
i am 5 ft tall. and this dress is a little too short for me to wear in public. I would suggest going the next size up. Don't get me wrong it is a cute dress and it is very comfortable. But after washing it shrinks and its will show my butt if I bend over just a little. So i just use it as lounging attire.
"I am a true size 6 in sneakers, 5.5-6 in shoes. After reading the reviews I decided to go half a size down because most agreed they run large. The 5.5 was surprisingly big. There was about 2 inches worth of space in the toe bed. I'm exchanging for a size 5, which I suspect will fit.

Also, by no means are my feet wide but they did feel a little more snug than usual around the top part of my foot, but not uncomfortable. Maybe they just need a little breaking in, even though they are canvas. Let's see how the 5 fits..."
"This is a little snug.  I'm losing weight, so I'm going to hang onto it, I'm sure it will fit great soon!"
"They are pretty colors, feel good on my feet, but there is a very different and very strong smell that did not come out entirely in the wash."
"Nice, but to small for my arms. I thought an adult could use it :("
"Actually, these shorts are pretty good, except for the Velcro pockets. They are a pain in the rump! OK, you're trying to put your wallet, for instance, in your hip pocket; you fight the Velcro flap up, then TRY to get that wallet in there, but before you can, the flap simply falls down and INSTANTLY locks down, and now you have to do it again, and again, and again, until sometimes it takes two (2) hands to get the job done, SO, you wind up tucking the flap into the pocket out of frustration, making the garment much less attractive. Just saying....USE SNAPS, LEE!!!"
I used to like them until I bought a pair of brooks and that was the end of these. ;)). Once you try brooks its impossible to go back to anything else
If you want something to fit perfectly its not always the way you want it but its guaranteed that the time and delivery is right and also looks just like the picture.
I absolutely love this however I need a 5x. The 3x was way too snug. Maybe it runs really small. Mine was made perfectly no seeing imperfections. It sper light and airy. Just wish it wasn't so clingy.
"fit well, but are thin"
"I bought 3 of these and one showed up broken, this one is the one i'm replacing it with, not real happy with this."
Were a little tight. But got compliments all day.
"The shoe fits pretty good. I ordered a 13 and it seems a little short, but that is OK.
The shoe provides the basic support and gets good traction. The one thing I do not like, and a big factor, the in-sole is not comfortable. There is no cushion or arch support. I used an insert and now it feels much better.
I got a ""deal"" price, the deal price was lost by having to purchase the inserts."
"It is not the best for swimsuits, but if put in any kind of bra it definitely gives and extra size or two! They are noticeable to the one wearing it but its not a bad thing. Its squishy and cool and fits pretty much A-C sizes"
"Five dollars cheaper than the comparable Eagle Creek product .
The Pacsafe belt has more rugged zippers and a zip pocket that
is 8 inches longer.  More for less.  However both belts share the
same clasp mechanism with is vastly inferior to that on an older
Eagle Creek money belt of mine.  It will not stay buckled if there
is any outward pressure.  Any tightening of the gut, ... say when
you are hoisting your pack, and the buckle unclasps.  Not much
of a belt.  Obviously the engineers never tried their redesign."
small in the arms
"The shoe is durable and looks great on the outside. However, it is very hard and not breathable. It makes the feet sore and damp after a couple of hours."
"Beautiful sandals, but they were very large. I am usually a 6.5-7, but these were way to big.  Very nicely made, but I had to return them."
"A bit large, wish it was a bit more form fitting, then again, perhaps I should have ordered a size smaller!"
"I ordered this because it's one size up from my daughters current dance shoe, but unfortunately it much too big for her. I should have selected the half size in between."
"Even though this dress is forgiving around the waistline, the bottom half is somewhat transparent."
it very difficult to put on hurt my feet when I wear it not my favorite
not the best quality but ok for the price
Material too thin! Almost see thru!
"These are decently made sunglasses for the price - similar to Target quality, however, I definitely feel like in the bright sun they don't allow the best visibility compared to my other cheap sunglasses from the actual Target store. Ha. I find that annoying so I can't say I'd really recommend them unless you just want to look cute."
length shrinks quite a bit
"The skirt parts fits fine but the panty part is not long enough to reach the buckles without wrenching it painfully up my crack. Luckily it's an easy alteration , just adding couple inches of fabric at the crotch seam. The material is cheep & thin, as expected for the price. I am 5'9"" and 190 and got the 2xl."
Very nice looking shoe.  It's hard for me to find shoes since I require a 5e width.  Still breaking the shoes in but they have no padding in them at all.  Not what I expected since they were just about $100.00.
I give it a three-star because I had to return it. I have a low Arch and it has too much Arch. Lots of room in the forefoot and color is Vivid and true!
"It looks nice and opens and closes cleanly (and is compact), but for all the claims about being ""windproof"", it isn't. It flipped right over at the first hint of wind. So if you just need something compact without much wind protection, this is fine. If you want something truly windproof, get a GustBuster instead."
"First, it must be known I give 5 stars to this seller who showed stellar speed in getting me the shoes. And 5 stars to Amazon for handling the return of the same.

This pair of Cyprus III Croc's gets three stars rather than the usual 5 (given to three other pairs of Croc's). Why? For those of us with high arches this shoe is troublesome because of the strap at the top. Particularly where the two straps meet and form a bump with a particularly inflexible (stiff) and unsmooth juncture which presses in to the top of the (very bony) part of the foot. For my feet these are an impossible design. Which is sad because they were adorable.

All other aspects of the construction of the sole, inner sole and how the vamp (top of the shoe) attaches to the bottom of the shoe is in keeping with the great quality expected from Croc's. I really wish it had worked for me. Hope it works for others. But those of you with high, bony arches, be advised."
"It is attractive and seems strong.  I was disappointed in the packaging.  It was in a plastic baggie inside a nice jewelry box.  However, despite guides available in the box it was twisted and tangled.  I spent about 20+ minutes getting it straight, and I think I damaged 2 links trying to get in untangled."
its well made--but cut small and too long
Better order a size or two up.  Not cut the same as other Hanes T-shirts.
"I was trying to match some of the underwear I already own. The picture doesn't really match what I received.

Maybe the order got screwed up but what I got was more of a boxer brief. Also, the ""Calvin Klein"" stitching looks a little rough, almost like a knock off. Not worth returning but still..."
"I like this shoe a lot but the only reason I gave it a 3 star and not more was because my ankles are a little bit larger than most people's so the strap is a little snug where you clasp it. There isn't a great arch support so sometimes my feet feel a little sore if I wear them all day and am standing for extended periods of time.

Besides that the shoe is soooo cute! I love the sparkles. I wear these to work and for formal events. I would recommend to anyone who wants to have a flashy sandal :)"
"Color is a gold shimmer, which was ok. It is very shear. Need an under shirt"
"It was smaller than the size of the publication, and the fabric of low quality"
Too large for my foot.  Well constructed.
"it is a nice hat, the color is green not tan, the center arc of the bill is off center of the hat probably because of the eagle on the bill, took a while to get it to look right, having said that it is a nice hat with an eagle on the side and an eagle on the metal clip on the back"
After about three weeks they began leaking through the soles. Super cute though
Very skimpy!
"I really love the shoe, but the fit is concerning."
"The wedge part of the boot seems like it's made out of the gummy shock-absorbing type of material, but it actual makes quite a loud sound when you clip-clop around on a hard floor.

The sizing is not exactly generous.  I wear between an 8.5 and 9, and the 9 in this boot was juuuust large enough.  Any smaller and it would have been a dealbreaker.  Order your normal size, but if you like to wear thick socks you may not be happy.

The best thing about these boots is how small they make your foot look.  It's a neat optical illusion the way the sole cuts inward below the tip of the toe, because your eye registers the shoe as being much smaller than it really is.  So that's a plus.

I haven't decided if I'm going to keep them yet---it's hard to find mid-calf wedge boots for some reason.  They're not extraordinarily uncomfortable, but they're not over-the-top comfortable either.  They're just okay."
"My younger son said it is a bit narrow and not easy to put on so I have to returned this. But, my other son likes it a lot. The colors and style is sharp and cool. Almost not like sandlas and I do like the clost toes design to protect their feet and from kicking in staffs.  It is not a lot of support so I don't think it is mean for wearing it for long hours. But, my son did wear it sometime at Hawaii during a few days trip other than his regular tennis shoes."
1010 way to small go up at least a size UP. New balance are usually to wide and a half size to big for me. I wear a 5 and after reading comments I thought yes these would fit perfect maybe you should try up a size and half. I didn't because ordered New Balance Ionix.
"Not really made for postpartum bodies. In 5'7"" and 185lbs post baby. I purchased an XL and I had to squeeze into this top. It wasn't comfortable and it rode up my belly when I walked. It is long, it's practically a dress."
"I like the retro styling of this suit, but the sizing is WAY off. I wear a size 4-6, ordered a M as others recommended to order up, (usually I wear a S in most clothing) and the torso is very short, and the overall size is too small. I can squeeze into it, but that does not bode well for durability. Disappointed. Now I must return it for a larger size. If you are a S, you must order a L, so order 2 sizes up!"
"I am 5'8, lean athletic build average bust and ordered a medium. I wanted it to fit not tight but not too loose either and it is just that. Color is gorgeous and it is very comfortable. I have a long torso and am worried about shrinkage from the dryer so I will definitely be hang drying it.

Update 5/23/17: I've had this shirt for quite some time now and after the first few washes it began to lose its shape. I deducted a star for that since the shirt is rather baggy now after washing on delicate in cold water and hang drying. The color is still vibrant but I don't wear it too often since I don't like the way it fits anymore."
I bought two. The sewing on one of them at the top back side was getting loose. But overall ok for the price.
"Bought the red in a 2x (normally wear 18/20)-  though it is nicely made and a lovely shade, the shirt runs small - hugs close to the body, so I won't be wearing it without a cover up and because of the size, it's tight around the hips, so the cool 'flowy' reason I bought it doesn't apply - not meant for a plus sized hourglass shape"
you can walk around for a few hours without having issues but for my feet they gave me blisters all over...but they look cool at the gym ;-)
"very narrow, a bit clunky as well."
"Thought I would like it better - it only carries the bare minimum of ID and credit cards. I occasionally when I just need some bills, D.L. and a credit card."
"These were ok.  The fur shed a bit too much for my liking, but they served their purpose for one night."
I am returning because they are too small
"I bought the medium, but the arms and shoulders ran larger than expected. I like the jacket and will buy a small, but I'm worried that this will lead to a good fit in the arms and shoulders while being too snug in the waste. We'll see...

Update: I did exchange this for a small after my initial review and, as expected, the arms and shoulders fit much better but the stretchy wastes was too short and tight. This jacket might fit thin body frames well. I'm a small guy, but naturally thicker in the arms and waste."
the Fur all to take off he is come to lags
"It's muslin cotton and it doesn't have any stretch to it (personally don't have any other muslin clothes, so it was just something I wasn't aware of.)
It was also a bit tighter in the torso than I was expecting (XL size.)
Otherwise, it seems to be quite fine and is a nice shirt."
"I love these! But even being very careful with care, washing by hand, hand drying..., as I read the reviews... still, the fabric came opened at the seems... poor quality, but comfy and cute. Don't expect to use these for a long time, they are a bit disposable,."
"Fits very well but its just very plain, safe."
They look pretty but feel cheap
cute but not the greatest quality.
"I ordered a small size but it was still too large, I am still thinking what to do about it."
"I would rate these a 5 for comfort, a 4 for durability (they catch on everything) and a 3 for length.  The socks are different lengths and different calf sizes."
"While the length is correct, my sis were unable to wear it as her feet could not slide in. The opening size is fixed and there is no way to enlarge it to allow the feet to slide in. So, if your top of your feet is high (hence larger circumference) avoid this model and go for the normal Onitsuka.

Luckily someone else was able to wear this shoe and manage to slide in albeit with a bit of push. Definitely not for someone with a high top arch(?) - sorry. don't know the correct terminology for this."
"Do you know what I appreciate about this watch the most? It's large, easy to read face. I use reading glasses and so many watches that look great I really have to squint to read. This watch has a sturdy, rugged band and a high contrast display. What more can you ask for?"
The zipper  feels tight to zip  (even when I am hanging up on a hanger after wearing)  and I am always afraid when I force it the zipper is going to break.  But it hasn't yet.....
"I was disappointed with the quality of the wallet. I have had 2 of the same wallets in the past 10 years , both of high quality, that is why I ordered another one when my zipper was wore out. I will look for another brand now because I know this one won't last."
I did like this outfit but returned because it was see through
The same style in the button Vee necks are way more comfortable. The somewhat small size makes these sort of uncomfortable around the neck
Plastic beads joined together no string between them it looks like a mold was used. I bought it off a friend's wish list and if I am this disappointed with the bracelet I can only imagine she will be too.
"loved it online, but the skirt is surprisingly short."
Well I really love these shoes in theory. They're so comfy and light but I have very short toes and the front of these shoes just looks like a duck bill and they're way too long. If you have wide feet or short toes then these are not for you. Order a half size small. I'm disappointed they don't fit me well.
"As of right now, they're great for the price, noticed some of the orange thread is loose/unraveling but for the price we paid not bothered by it. We'll have to see how they hold up."
"I loved the design on these shoes, but unfortunately it fit too big. I always buy pumps size 8.5 or even 9 (to have a little wiggle room when I walk in them all day), but the buckle on this shoe was way too long and not adjustable, so it just hung outside the shoe, making it look quite unflattering. I thought about trying returning it and getting another pair half a size smaller, but the shipping takes way too long (it took 3 weeks to arrive after I ordered them) and I needed shoes much sooner."
"I am a 5'8"" tall and had to have it shortened two inches. Became expensive jumpsuit"
"A little to big ,but cute and can break easily.  I wouldn't buy again."
Good buy. quality a little thin for my taste.
"It definitely pushes my boobs together creating more cleavage, but when I put on a shirt, it makes my boobs look like they're shaped weird."
"Material, although very soft, is VERY thin.  Definitely will have to wear a t-shirt under this t-shirt.  Ok for the price, but not a total bargain."
"it is very pretty, but it broke within 2 months of wearing it daily."
A chemical smell when I open up the package.
Daughter did not like.  Bought dress for her.
"Decent material, although I ordered an x-large after reading they ran small and short. I am 5'5"" and 140lb. This Jacket was long enough although very baggy and not a very flattering fit. I may return it for the $20 or give it so someone."
Nice but fuzz all over sweatshirt
"ummmm, everyone is right...WAYYYYYYY TOOOOOOOOO BIGGGGGGGGG!!!! 3 stars for made in usa though...hey rainbow, copy drifter usa but make it this price!"
super cute. love these
"I originally ordered a 7, those were waaaay too big. I then ordered a 5 and initially thought they fit okay, though a bit too big, but after wearing them a couple of times they are definitely too big both in the waist and thigh area for me. I do have a small butt and skinny legs, but usually I can get 7s & 5s that fit me really well. Also, the color I received is much darker than what is pictured even though I selected the lighter option. I'm bummed that I will likely have to donate these after only wearing a couple of times, but skinny jeans aren't flattering if they're kind of baggy."
Sheinside items are super cute but fits really small. I bought a large but it was too snug for the look. I had to buy another one - xl.
"Can't review shoe yet, since my normal size was a very tight fit.  I ordered a 12 and exchanging for a 13..just a heads up for anyone considering this shoe."
"I got the top that when you choose which top to buy it is the 1st and 3rd one.  First off, it is not stretch material,  it seems to be leftover t-shirt material (two pieces sewn together to be exact.  The finish is not that great, and since it is one long intwined string that also does not stretch, this could be problematic.b  The shirt goes down to mid-back, but comes up in the front to where it barely covers the ladies.  I bought a large and am a bra size 36b.  I bought this to wear under backless shirts for summer since I think it is tacky to be able to see a bra under strappy shirts.  I would never wear this one for a workout since when I raise my arms, you can see underboob!!!  Again that was for the style of the girl who has on the ballerina slippers.

****I did also buy the last two bras in the series of pictures, the ones that are the one size and they had more stretch, better material and more support!!!  Those were also less expensive!!!****"
I know of the legend of the three wolf one moon t-shirt.  I was hoping this shirt would come somewhere close to that level.  All it did was make my fiance go and get a pet cat.
"At first I ordered a 7.5 based on other reviews. I am normally a size 7 and the 7.5s were too big. I then ordered a 7 and they fit perfectly although they had a bent zipper. I contacted the seller about the zipper about a week ago and am still jumping through hoops with the seller to get them returned. Love the shoes, but the seller is making it very difficult to return the defective pair."
Not impressed with this bra at all.  Fitted small and was NOT a comfortable fit. Wish all bras were created equal.
"my son asked for a pair of lighter brown oxfords for Xmas and after reading the reviews of this item I decided to buy them and had the coupon too making it a steal. I opened the box to look at them prior to wrapping and the front of the shoe is very pronounced as in long so I had to return them as I knew he would not like that. His prior Oxfords were from J. Cre* and were shorter in the toe box and a bit more preppy as he is at age 23. They do have a very nice cushioned insole, but the whole sole including the perimeter around the shoe was rubber with fake stitching out of rubber. I'm sure they would be very comfy and durable, but not what I know my son would like so unfortunately I had to send them right back."
"I normally order things I like and don't wear them immediately. I do try them on but trying them on and actually wearing them are two different things. I finally wore them after breaking a toe, to find that they are a bit tight. It's an okay shoe. But I think I would have returned them."
"I think I would have liked these shoes, but they were too short so had to return.  I wear an 11 in ASICS, but 11 in the RYKA was way too short.
Not sure they came in a larger size."
"Very long. I like the Kohls long tanks and these are almost a dress on my long torso they aren't very thick and the straps don't stay shortened, I find myself readjusting them all day long. I think they will just be my beach tanks from here on out versus wearing them under my shirts because they cause me to fidget too much..."
"The pendant is perfect, however the chain is another matter. THIS DEFINITELY IS NOT STAINLESS STEEL!!!  I'm posting a picture of the necklace and pendant to show you exactly what I'm talking about. As you can see, the chain is no longer has the ""stainless steel"" on a good portion of it. Now it looks like I need to order a decent stainless steel chain for the the pendant. Not too happy with having to do this :-(

I gave 5 stars in my previous rating, but now that has dropped to 3 stars. The 3 stars is for the pendant only. The chain is -0 stars."
"love the post and backing, but the gemstone is dull and gray looking- no shine.  Tip:  use a safety pin or bobby pi to remove from packaging.  Sharp enough to reopen slightly closed piercings if desired- made to use in a piercing gun."
"This was a beautiful watch, but unfortunately the watch was too small for my wrist. I had taken the tag off when I received it to aid in trying to put it on, but to no avail. The seller was very hesitant in refunding my money (minus a ""restocking fee"") because the watch appeared to be ""worn."" I'm assuming they said that because of the tag being taken off. After a heated discussion with the seller over the phone, they agreed to refund my money. Great watch, just be wary of the seller."
"Bought this for my wife, looks great but the material is cheap, this thing is not gonna last too long. Already wearing thin and hole are starting to come out."
"Material is way shiny and not very regal looking. I am 5'10"" and the skirt reached the floor even with my 4"" heels."
"So soft and comfy, I love these. Unfortunately the top of the band began to have elastic strands come out and fray the top. Still works, comfortable and attractive but won't last like previous boxers."
"Comfortable with stretchy, thick fabric, but not as flattering as I had expected. A little too tight for my liking."
"I got two pair, same size. The brown one fits considerably tighter than the blue ones."
The bulbs get hot fast. The lead wires that go from the battery to the bulbs are kind of short so if you are trying to hide the battery on something larger than this skull in the photo you may be quite limited. I was trying to illuminate the skull of a bear and ended up needing to tape the battery to the top of his head simply because the wires were so short.
"Still in packing, ask after the holidays"
"I'm not sure what it is but even though I thought they would be my every day sandals, unfortunately they are not. They are true to size, and the leather is very nice, however when I put them on they don't feel as comfortable as they look on the picture, I feel like I'm  walking in wooden clogs and they make my legs/feet look ugly, not flattering at all. Another thing, I have a bunion on my right foot, and somehow these sandals make the bunion look huge and ugly which doesn't happy with other sandals. So yeah, I wear them once in a while, but they are not my favorite shoes."
"I do wish Amazon would correct their website - - these are NOT made in the USA, they are made in China. I've had mine for about three years with almost daily use, but usually less than 8 hours per day, and I don't do heavy work. They have held up alright for the most part, but the welt started to rip away from the outer edge of the boot after only six months. Still, they are comfortable after breaking in (doesn't take long with the dual density soles.) I really appreciate the aluminum toe, which gives protection with little added weight. They support my ankles well when I walk on uneven dirt slopes at landfills and demolition sites. The soles do show some wear, and I suspect that they might not hold up as well for a guy who does heavier work than I do.

I bought mine at a Red Wing store. They measured my feet and told me I would need an 8.5EE. I told them I'd been comfortable wearing a 9D for nearly 40 years now... but they were right! I tried them on, and they fit perfectly, better than my previous 9D Timberland boots. The Red Wing guys knew what they were talking about.

These are pretty good, but I think next time I will try a pair of USA made Red Wings."
Super cute. Pretty large for the size.
not that well constructed has already snagged.
Quite large for a baby size.  MY son is almost 2 and they don't stay on his head yet.
I'm going to give it three stars because of the zipper. It's absolutely sexy on I'm not gonna lie but that zipper is just horrifying miscarry being where it's located it really does it down and to boot it's made out of metal why would you do that? In such a sensitive area I would expect that to either be plastic or just for looks but it's an actual zipper. I'm scared to wear it again. Yup!  I honestly wish they had made it in plastic zipper and if you do read this and you make it in a plastic zipper please contact me because I'll buy it immediately thank you !
"Nice materials, but the sleeves are short and too tight, they have super skinny arm"
The quality of the leather does not match the picture. It doesn't look as nice or have even the same color really. It's an nice enough looking wallet on its own but it's not what I wanted comparing image with what was received.
Not terribly uncomfortable.
Liked the way these are constructed but they were wide for my feet. Had to return them
"I haven't had the opportunity to wear it yet, (wedding in NOLA in May) but I'm a 38F and this is a little roomy in the bust even on me. I bought a 2x, however, I'm sure an xl would be too tight. The arm holes are also roomy, but the dress flows nicely, fits at the waist and is just long enough on my 5'6"" frame."
Too tight.  Too much fiber residue on feet after wears.
"My kids loved these shoes, expect for the fact that the fit a little small for the size that they wear."
Someone might be wearing them now...it is Friday and comfy time
it was okay. but was small
"Little larger than I thought it would be. I'm about 50 inches at the widest part of my hips/thighs, but have a smaller waistline. Was just the slightest bit too big, but I like it. Not very functional for actually holding anything up, but it serves the sexy purpose :)"
"Very, very small. Returned with no problems"
"I got this for my 15 month old. He's in the 95th percentile for height and the pants were definitely too short. My poor little guy had to be taken out of them because they kept riding up around his diaper. Also, the suspenders should be pinned or velcroed. They kept coming off of his shoulders."
"beautiful shoe fits tight, very classy but uncomfortable. Spent most of the day at my desk with my shoes kicked off"
The shoes seem well made but were smaller than expected.  The tongue is also a little short.  But they have worn well and take a beating.
"I got this when amazon was having a sale for watches so I really can't complain.

The face of the watch is a standard size but I would have liked the band to be a bit larger. It looks small on my wrist and I am an average sized guy."
The waist is a little small. You may want to get a size larger.
Cute top but bottoms are way to small for size 12.
These were much smaller than I expected. Maybe a way to show carat size would have helped me choose the size I had in mind. Sparkle factor is there.
"These undies are OK, but they do not have enough 'hold-in' power for me.  I would like them to be a little more snug-fitting (maybe I should have gotten a size smaller).  Otherwise, they are exactly as pictured - a nice 'vanilla' color."
"These are the only Keens I've had (3 pair so far) that have held up over time. These are great for slipping on and taking the dog out for example, or if you want they're not bad for general usage either. I've found them to be dry and comfortable, though I think it's worth noting they offer less support than the typical Keen that I have tried in the past."
"Wore these shoes for an OCR (obstacles course race), they held up in the mud.  However, I have a really high arch, and they do not provide the support for my arch.  Would recommend changing out the sole provided for arch support.  The exterior of the shoe held up well for trail running and OCRs.  Washed off, as well as put in the washing machine for an extra cleaning and came perfectly clean.

Toe area - plenty of room. Toes are not squished.  I like for my toes to have plenty of room when running.

Heels have plenty of support and the back area doesn't run narrow.

The laces are very thin, which is normal with trail shoes.  Didn't really have to wear shoes long to ""Break them in"" like most shoes.  Overall, they are okay for the price."
Some lift but not much.
"The dress looked nice overall, but i ordered plum it was more of a reddish/mauve color. didn't match the other bridesmaid's so i had to return.

Also: some people have commented saying the shoulder straps are way tight, but that is because they are supposed to fit off-the-shoulder. knowing this, they fit fine"
"A good looking shoe, at a very low price. My son is 4, wore the shoe apart within one month. I replaced this with a different shoe."
Cute look but to big
"This is adorable, and I have no issues with the quality! However, it appears to have been designed based on the proportions of an Oompa Loompa. My son is unfortunately built like his father, so his legs are already short, but the legs on this romper are still too short to fit him properly. Recommendation: buy tall socks with this item."
Colour is as shown but cannot go out in cold weather depending on it as it not fitting and coming off  almost immediately!
Returned Item and disappointed on my refund
"for being a size 6 they are very big, really did not like them"
"It's very pretty, and feels like good quality, but just taking it out of the packaging, it's WAY too small.  I used the sizing chart on the page, and it's not even CLOSE to the size it is supposed to be.  Comes from China, and their sizes are a lot different from US sizing. Just keep that in mind.  I have to return it for a refund, although I had having to do so."
"I'm very small so I usually roll my eyes when things say, ""too small"". This was not kidding. If you're over 105lbs, get the medium-at least the bottoms. The top fit great."
"I have bought New Balance 608, blue trim, in size 7 wide for many years.  They have always fit perfectly.  This time I bought the Pink in 7 wide, and they run small.  I measured them against current pair and they are shorter from front to back almost an inch.  They are a little snug, but didn't want the hassle of exchange, so I'm keeping them, hoping they will stretch a little."
"My daughter loves this nightgown because it is super cute.  Unfortunately even with washing it on delicate and hanging it to dry, some of the tulle came loose and had to be mended.  I ordered up one size for her and it fits perfect."
"Quality no as nice as I had hoped, but not expensive either."
"I am 34B and ordered a medium and feel a little constricted in these. I wanted to replace it but for the price of shipping, I decided to just give it away."
"Length was okay but the leather was too tight at inside curve before the toes. Potential risk of bad blisters.  I did not want to take the chance of having the leather stretch and still having it feel tight, therefore returned it."
"Too tight on the upper part--could tell instantly they just weren't going to work. The length was fine--width, not so much.  The material would have rubbed the sides of my feet raw.  Maybe I just have a fat foot...don't have problems with other shoes though.  Had to return."
I sent it back.  There was a rhinestone missing. Unacceptable. It was a very nice bag and I would have kept it if it was not damaged.
"three stars because it is made with cheap materials, but it looks great. I used it for a Dallas Cowgirl costume. It was comfortable and wide which is perfect because I have bunions. I wouldn't use it for anything other than my costume."
Just like it says small but good quality not a cheep design or print
"I mean, I guess they're strictly horse riding boots which I know nothing about.  They may be great riding boots but you wouldn't want to buy them for casual wear because of the huge ugly heel."
The jacket is very beautiful and very light. BUT there are many places where between the seams sticks out fluff. I pointed the arrows at the photo. I also didn't like the big space around my neck. The jacket does not protect the neck from the wind.
"The bodice and bust fit fine, but the seams are weak for something that needs to stretch going on (over hips) and the leg holes are too small (they don't follow the rest of the suit sizing). You're getting what you pay for."
"I am a 5'5 115 pound female whos size is small/xsmall in womens.
And this was waaaaay too big, too long and too wide, asian large.
I am getting a US x-small/asian medium in the mail and will see how that fits.
I liked the color and material, however it was too big."
I had to return this because it had a stitching error on the inside.
"The fabric is very sheer and you can see right through the cream color. It is cheaply made, but will work as the under piece for a costume, but not as a dress as I had hoped."
It is a beautiful vest and since we live in Florida we fish a lot. The only problem I had was I ordered a XL and received a XXXXL. Very durable and may even purchase a few for Christmas gifts
"Doesn't fit well on bigger bodied men, if you are one, go another size up.  I generally wear size 36, ran too tight around my butt."
They are ok...A little big...My biggest complaint Is the back pockets. They are huge making my butt look huge. Hate Levi pockets.
"The handles are strong but are not reinforced where they attach.  This causes the bag to ""sag"" a bit.  Wish the leather went all the way around the bottom and I wish the fabric canvas  was doubled or handles reinforced then it would be 5 stars...it is beautiful however!"
"I so very, very much wanted to be able to wear this shoe!  I ordered my size, and the length and width were great but the heel is too wide so the back of the shoe flips and rubs with each step,  The quality of this shoe is evident throughout, when standing only they are wonderfully comfortable, I wish I could walk in them."
It's hard to judge the shirt as the sizing was very large. The thin material would probably be great for keeping cool and fast drying but it did not appear to have a very nice shape which may just be due to the fact that the size was so large.
"I bought the body suit in rust and while it is a gorgeous color, it was pretty low cut and fit my petite shoulders a bit strange. I sent it back and got the more plain cut one without the zipper in navy and I like it much better, since it doesn't scoop down so far  in the front or back."
"Item looks just like pictured.  I was worried that it would be too small because I got a size small.  I usually wear a size 8 but it was plenty big and roomy. Update- I have never worn it because it does not look good on me, don't like the material. It is more like costume material. Okay for lounging around the house."
Too small. I had to return them.
I can't say too much since the size I got was wrong. However the material is good and the look is clean.
"Good price for all the equipment that comes with it, but the bigger the plugs and tapers get the heavier they are. I ended up not being able to use the bigger sizes because they weighed my ears down too much."
very cute but was not the right fit for me
"i really liked them, the were very comfortable out of the box. however, after a day of normal use, i had a rather large blister on my little toe  - of only one foot. something about the way the shoes sat just wasn't quite right. really wish they fit better, i really liked them."
Runs on the small side.
Gave them to my sister
"This is a quality sock, and I like the Carhartt brand.  The toes and heels are reinforced ( thicker)  the instep has lycra so it hugs the arch of the foot, so the sock doesn't slide down.  I took 2 stars off because I think the body of the sock is small for a mens sock.  The absolute maximum the top of the sock can be stretched is 12"".  These barely fit my husbands calf, and he wears it with work boots and scrunches the sock down, which is fine.  I hope they don't shrink!  My husband is on the slender side, certainly not stocky or anything - so just be aware of that when you purchase.  Measure the bottom part of your calf."
"Very cute shoes, but the leather is not very soft, which makes them not as comfortable as hoped for."
"This is a good watch and is easy to set. I love the look of it and the band is solid so no need to worry about it falling off when roughing it up. The display however, can only be from viewed directly above. If you view the watch face from any other angle, it will read all 8s which is frustrating. Also the pressure from rubbing the sleeve of my uniform cuff is enough to hit the Mode button which can lead to resetting the date and time or just some annoying beeps in my experience. The instruction manual that came with the watch didn't match the watch I received."
"Fit good, both buttons broke though"
"My order arrived on time with no issues. This nightgown and robe set is very nice. The quality is good, especially for the price. I would have rated it higher but, it was very small. I suggest ordering one size up, or even two sizes if you like sleepwear to fit full."
"The collars are crazy big.  You want the Propper Uniform Polo if you want nice polo, not this.  I don't know WTF they were thinking with that collar.  It is ridiculous."
"These headbands are super cute, and I get lots of compliments, but, like anything made in China, they seem a bit cheap and flimsy.  Plus, the sizing is not consistent.  Some of them fit my baby's head well, and some I have to tie a knot in to fit.  A few of them are falling apart after a few uses.  I would recommend them if your baby won't take them off and play with them."
"Shrunk a bit after washing but they just barely fit. also 2 buttons fell off in the washer. I bought 3 other pairs from other venders and not the same issue. better order I size bigger, and be ready with a thread and needle"
I bought her usual size 3 and they are alteast 2 sizes to big.  Shoes were of fair quality but they were VERY cheap.  Shipping from the retailer was fast.  Will work next year maybe.
Fit was GREAT until dried.... It shrunk a ton in the drier. Can't wear it anymore
It is very thin and clingy.  I bought a s/m and it shows the lines of the shirt underneath.  I guess you get what you pay for.  The color is nice and it did not run in the laundry.
"I thought that the product (being cotton) would be very soft- it's actually quite itchy and it doesn't fit very well. Note: IF YOU ARE CURVY THEN STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!!! both as harem pants AND a jumper, the outfit looks strange- I now just wear it to bed or when I'm belly dancing"
"Liked the shoe, not the fit. The length was too short and a bit too narrow."
"Based on other reviews, I am shocked to say that this top is way too big for me. Other customers listed their stats, I am taller, bustier, weigh more and simply overall a bigger person and while they found the top perfectly sized or even too small, this top is clearly too big on me, sliding it into frumpy. I purchased 2 other tops at the same time, while all 3 would likely have suited me better in a size L instead of an XL, the other 2 look good and as they may shrink, I decided to keep them in the XL. This one I'm sending back and in future I will purchase a size L as my default size in the brand.
I am 5'10, 47-35-42, due to my bust (and belly) I am usually always a size XL or larger in tops. The largest size noted for this top is 42 in the bust so I even wondered if the XL would be too small. Not a chance. I'd likely end up a M in this top but I'm not going to take a chance. I ordered the light brown, the color was a bit darker than I expected but not unpleasant."
"I like the cut and length (about 3-4"" above knee, I'm 5'2"") BUT it runs tight (I'm a solid small, sometimes x small, ordered small) and the fabric is quite thin.  Have not washed it yet. BUT it's so hard to find cotton blend clothing online that I may keep it."
"It's cute but didn't even cover my 11 month olds diaper, so had to return it"
Nice looking but rather wide
"I returned this because it was a bit large, but needed to wash it before returning.  Unfortunately the dye ran all over everything and the skirt started to fall apart.  Not a favorite item."
"Good looking watch, but it came with a dead battery. It cost me $16 for a new one before I could even wear it. Pretty crappy"
"I ordered a size 11, and I think I have relatively proportionate feet, so I was surprised these shoes were so narrow.  The calf part fit well, it's made for people with skinny/average calves.  Just needs a wider foot bed option.  Maybe I'll try exchanging for a size up and see if that's any better. The material/quality was pretty good.  Maybe not $50 worth, but since there aren't many options for boots like these in size 11, made with man-made materials, I guess they can charge a little more."
Has sewn in pads and they are very flat not conformed so make your breast look odd. Wish pads we're remove able so I could purchase good ones.
"Ordered a Toddler 5 for a boy who just started weraing 5T tops. Washed 1 time in cold water. The shirt either shrank or is missized. While it still fit for the most part, it is very short in the torso. The sleaves were still the right size and a goid (to elbow) length. The neck opening was a bit big but nothing to worry about."
Fit ok but way more brown than olive so could not use for outfit intended
LOVE this item......wish I had got it one size larger tho....tends to run tighter than expected
Really nice looking purse but too squishy for me. I wanted one that was a bit sturdier. Returned this one. But it looks nice and seemed like it was made really well. Would recommend if you want soft and squishy in a purse!
"Very cute shoes, however they do not fit like other Dansko. They have more of a curve to them, did not form to my feet well. I have osteoarthrits in my great toes and these were painful for me to walk it. The Dansko Professionals are a much better shoe for me."
Shrunk in the dryer and legs too short now
"My sister told me that she loved her Underarmer shoes, so I bought a pair . I don't like the arch and they are not nearly as comfortable as others I have. I will not buy any more."
Too big for me. I'm 5 4' and 116 lbs ordered the smallest size.
"These are very tiny, but pretty."
Puffy on the side
Love the size. Cards fit snuggly for now. Only issue is that it had visible scratch marks on the  surface. It's quite frustrating to get a new item with visible and obvious defects.
Comfortable fit and nice shade of gray.  The fabric was lighter than I expected.
"I own several Patty Boutik tops but this is not one of my favorites. I purchased a small in Olive Green--I'm 5'1, 135, 34B. While I would say it fits true to size, the material is thin and tends to cling, while the neckline is a bit too low for me. It's suitable for wearing underneath a puffy vest, but I had originally purchased it to pair with a skirt or dress pants to work and it doesn't quite work for that."
"I'm 5'5"" 130lbs and it was a little loose all around.  Did not flatter me at all. It was also a few inches from the ground and I prefer my maxi dresses to be touching when I'm bare foot."
"Fine watch. Heavy, clean design. Keeps accurate time. Absolutely no issues with the part of the watch that keeps time, the case.

The band, however, is a complete abomination. Clarification. The band is fine, the clasp is a walking disaster of legendary proportions. If you set a mechanical engineer to design the most problematic, least functional, horror show of a clasp, it still wouldn't be as bad as the unit on this watch.

First of all, who puts a disconnecting clasp on a heavy men's watch? When you manage to undo the clasp, the watch case is heavy enough to instantly topple the watch over, sending it sliding off your wrist onto whatever surface is below your feet. But, at least it's not that easy to undo.

That's the second problem. It's easy to unlock the clasp, but getting the hooked lever side off of the bar that it locks onto is an exercise in pure frustration. Once unlocked, there is no easy way to push, pull, move the two parts of the clasp to easily and reliably separate the two free ends of the band. Push on the lever? No. Pull on it? No. Push while trying to lift the bar? No. The clasp locking mechanism is designed such that however you choose to grip or apply pressure fails to move the two free ends into a relationship where they readily separate. My description is a mess because the mechanism is a mess.

But you only have this problem if you get the watch on and clasp secured. When you try to close the clasp, it reliably gets stuck or wedged on the retaining bar and forcing it doesn't help. You have to jiggle it and sometimes undo it entirely and restart again to get the clasp over the bar it grabs onto and try and close it again. My god, but this thing is an unmitigated failure. I cannot imaging how this design made it past proving.

Now, once you have figured out how to get it on, you can at least remove links to achieve that perfect fit, right? Not exactly. Unlike a typical buckle clasp, there is no micro adjustment capability. There is no series of holes for you to move spring pins around in half-link increments to customize the fit to some wrists. If you're lucky, you'll get to the point where taking out just the right number of links makes the watch sit perfectly right above the wrist. If you're unlucky, like me, taking out 5 links will make the band too tight. Taking out 4 links makes it so loose that it slides down past the wrist so the crown digs into the back of your hand. Too bloody tight or too floppy loose. Take your pick.

I was sooo close to sending this back because I hated this disaster of a clasp so much. It really does sour the experience of an otherwise really nice, solid man's watch. Instead, I researched here and ordered a replacement band made by MiLTAT. Once that comes in and I've had a chance to install it, I'll be back to post my impressions and perhaps some photos.

So, bottom line is unless you really love the case and movement and can get it at a good price and are willing to deal with the mess of a clasp or buy a replacement band, stay away from this problematic unit. I just cannot imagine that any Victorinox could have given the green light for such a total train wreck of a band clasp."
Killed my feet. didn't fit like the ones in the store.
"These are cute, but would be better for a person with narrow feet up by the toes.  The picture makes it look like it would definitely cover the top of foot, but below the pinkie toe wants to pop out.  I thought there would be less space between the front and back of the shoe.
Also, they are much more casual than dressy."
I love the look and feel of this bag. However if you wear blue jeans with it know that it will turn blue. Very sad that after carrying it two times it looks like an old worn out bag. Also the opening is too narrow and hard to fit much in it.
"The material of the shirt is very nice.  Super soft and nice color.  The style is great, except the sleeves fit VERY tight around your arms!  I even read the reviews before ordering, and ordered a size larger than I normally wear for this very reason.  I ended up with a baggy blouse with arm sleeves that make my arms look like sausages.  Bummer."
Very pretty shoe but run very small no size up so we will have to stretch them
Good support but disappointing that they are 1 time use hose. Both pairs run on the 1st wear. Great if not in a dress.
"It took two tries to get the correct size, but finally did. The first ones ran a little small."
Too narrow and restricting.  Even when laced as loose as possible.  They're wear-able and that's why I didn't return them but I probably won't buy them again.  I love the Nike Flex series and will probably stick with those.
Fit is as expected and price was good
This is a small XL
"Says 8.5, fitted more like an 8.. runs small."
The nude color is more of a brown color. Its fits okay but I have yet to go out with them
I gave this fringe scarf a 3 because it is very thin. It is made with very tiny string and not woven tight. I definitely will not be able to wear it while holding my children as it would easily snag. It will also snag on jewelry.
"A good product, but not perfect 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"
"Not as comfy as I hoped, love sketchers usually not sure about these probably won't keep"
"Not as comfortable a fit for one with a large head as described on the website.  I've since given it to a friend with a smaller cranium, and he's quite delighted.  So, as they say, it's all good."
"I bought this set to have some new pajamas following abdominal surgery.  I usually wear gowns but needed the 2 pieces during recovery. I also particularly bought the bamboo fabric as I have found it to be super soft in other sleepwear.  First, I normally wear a 1X but bought this set one size larger to allow for plenty of room and comfort.  After trying it on, it was a good thing I did because the top, even in the extra size was skimpy. Simply too tight in the bust. The bottoms, however, were so large that had there not been a drawstring they would have been on the floor. Not sure why the problems but I probably won't ever buy this brand again due to sizing variances.  On the plus side, the set will go to the women's shelter and maybe make one or two other people a good set or a good top or a good bottom. Finally, the set had a terrible odor upon being wet. Don't even have the words to describe accurately. After running through the dryer, it dissipated some but took a second washing and trip through dryer to rid itself of the noxious odor."
"Cute jacket nice material. However, extra material by the stomach if you zip the jacket can puff out and make you look like you have a little bit of a stomach. I have a small waist and do not like that aspect of the zipped look."
Luggage is smaller that what the picture shows. Will keep the set
Little small in size but it works
"You get what you pay for.  It looks fairly cheap on close inspection, but from a distance it is really pretty.  Received it with one stone out, but I glued it back in and voila! It probably is with the money if you're not expecting it to be something long term in your jewelry box."
"Pretty cheaply made. Stones fell out of the crown after my daughter wore it a few times. Granted she is pretty hard on things, but still. Anyway, she still love this set and the wand and gloves have held up nicely."
maybe need the skinny top part
Love the shirt but it runs small! I would order one size larger to be safe.
I purchased this product for my hubby. The price is quite reasonable but the holder is extremely bulky so of course it was not a hit with him.
It's ok if you need an umbrella infrequently. Wind gusts makes this bend & flip over.
"The leather is a bit stiff so the part that goes over the big toe is a little uncomfortable and cuts a little bit. I'm not certain that for me these would be comfortable for a great deal of walking, but they work ok as I sit doing office work quite a bit in a day. They don't seem to cause any issue with my plantar fasciitis though which is always important for me."
"A little mushy, but okay for casual wear. Would not recommend for hiking any rugged foot traffic.  Great appearance."
Comfortable all around with nice sole
Order up for a baggy fit; denim weight is medium weight with a little stretch.  Some fabric discoloration in spots.
"I should  have ordered medium.  However I liked it enough to give them to my sister.  ""Love's Them""."
These run a bit more narrow than some of the other brands I have purchased in wide. They look nice but could have been a bit wider.
"This review is a little bias because the shoes just didn't fit me very well.  If you have wider feet, these will probably not work for you.  They were too narrow for me and my feet felt too snug on the sides.  The sole doesn't provide much support, it is a standard foam sole that you would find in a regular sneaker.  The price does not justify the quality of the shoe."
"Sleeves are really saggy, fabric is kind of itchy but it looks like the picture."
I'm a regular size 8 and these were a too small ): I was bummed for how much they cost they'd be more true to size. They are really soft though and I can imagine how comfortable they would be if they fit. Get a half size up in whatever size you are to make sure they fit.
"I like the product, it just runs small & I won't be able to wear it, but it will make a nice gift. It was delivered on time, as advertised."
Larger than n a normal sixe 13
"Although these pajamas were very pretty and the material was nice and soft, I had to send them back as they were too tight across my stomach.  If the fit was satisfactory I would have kept the pajamas."
the back posts were much too long they actually hit neck and they tarnished quickly but cute design
"Looked like the product picture. Extremely cheap and thin plastic, probably would only hold up a few wears. If this was under $6 I might give it a 5 stars. For this price I expected the plastic to be a bit more sturdy."
"Looks good. Not worth the 450 they say
is the regular price. Worth about 100- that
is about what I paid. Dials hard to set- lugs to set dial do not work very well. Three star rating based mainly on the look of the watch."
"No matter how many times I set this watch, the day and date are never correct!  Grrrrrr!

I have bought similar watches without the date and have had no problems with the watch itself.

Replacing a watch I have owned about 6 months.  Strap broke after 6 months."
Bummed out the zipper came broken.
"The color is darker than the photo; a little more olive too.  It is advertised as machine washable, but the tag says dry clean only, so marks off for that."
"Nice, packable and lightweight for the money"
"I love the look but on the inside top of the shoe, it is uncomfortable.  Hoping that will stretch and will be better, but right now it hurts to wear them.  If the shoes decoration was smoother inside by the big toe, the shoe, it would be more comfortable.  Hope this explanation is helpful."
"The cap sleeves are a bit narrower than I expected, and the whole bodice part fits higher than I'd like, but it's still a nice dress.  I'm 5'7"" and it fit about tea-length.  The waist line fits higher under the bust, but I don't know if that's a sizing issue or a me-issue."
"Great look, very comfortable however soles wear easily with daily wear, Lasted 6 months."
When they said big boys - did not know it was for early teens. Had to return it but Amazon happily took it back and we got another product.
This is a classic fit so if u r looking for slim fit then this sweater would be big for u.
This dress was worn twice and washed then frayed all up the seam.  Poor quality
"The small is really small, fits my 4 year old who is 3'8"" and 32lbs (he's the size or a 3 year old)"
a lot smaller than it looked
"the designs great, but the red was bleeding into the design when i received it. not sure if it was purposefully supposed to be like that, but thats not how it looks in the pic"
"ooh quality of the fabric, it stained in blue my little one even after i washed for the first time as i always do with all his new clothes."
"I am loyal to Dickies products and have been for about 17 years.  This belt left me a little disappointed.  First of all, it barely fit though the loops in my Dickies shorts.  I made it fit but it kind of caused unnecessary wear to the belt.  I could not tuck the additional belt back through a second time after hooking the buckle.  The buckle is also a problem.  It is one of those that just has a post on the back of the buckel that you have to line up with the hole on the belt.  So you have to pull on one end of the belt while pushing down on the buckle hoping it lines up with the hole.  It is difficult to get it to feel snug.  It is also a little smaller than a typical belt.  I ordered it larger than I normally do and it fit with very little excess.  Unfortunately this will probably not be an everyday belt."
I got 2 sizes bigger than what I usually wear and it was still tight. Cute shirt though.
Love fabric. Pretty.  Too short. Only covers butt.  Only beach wear.  Not in town.
"The color of this swim set is not the same as what's shown in the display picture; it is orange without the brownish undertone (the color is the reason why I was so eager to purchase this set). I ordered a small, I wish the bikini bottom were a bit tighter and the bikini top covered my nipples properly. [i'm 5'6"" and i'm about 150lb with a 34B bra size]. Overall I like this swim set. I would've given it 5 stars if the color were hat I was expecting, the bikini bottom were tighter and the bikini top didn't expose part of my nipples."
"Cute shirt, but runs extremely big."
"Pretty dress, but I didn't like the way the neckline laid on me."
"The jacket is very nice, but with a pair of uses starts to look old."
Very good....Thank You....!!!!!!!
"A cheap alternative to expensive ( but really professional) watches.
For 90 bucks a good deal I guess:)"
"I love the colars and all and the fit is good, its just i was kinda disappointed by the fabric its very thin..I didn't appreciate that, and i bought the exact same ones at WAlmart.. Thats sad."
"Come on, this lightsaber is huge.  My kids can't even wrap their hands around it.  It's hard to handle and use.  Why can't they make it a bit smaller so kids can grip it."
Good but larger than I expected. This needs to fit very tight if you are using it for lap swimming.
The size range is inaccurate.  My husband wears an 11 and these are way way too small.
Too small. I'll go one size up next time. They do cut the wind as advertised though.
It was okay.  I bought it for a friend and it kept slipping off her head.
"Very cute shoe, but the sides bow out when I walk. The support factor is zero."
It a good dress for going shopping in or lunch in....the black top hits just under the breasts. Not at the waist. For me this doesn't show off my figure as from the side it doesn't sit close to the body. But if u need to hide a bit of belly this dress will do that for u! The material is good. The top is not very stretchy so watch ur sizing.
"I would have given this 5 stars, but my problem is that I ordered an XXL, and I typically wear a size XL.  I specifically read reviews saying it fit as expected at least 74% of the time.  I ordered a size up just in case, and it is very snug.  I am keeping it to give as a present, since it really is very cute, but I am very disappointed that I couldn't wear it, I was very excited about the purchase, until it didn't fit. :("
"I purchased this jacket in black, size M.  It fits beautifully and looks very stylish.  A very nice jacket and I love it. So, I decided to buy the same jacket in blue, same size.  When it arrived I immediately tried it on.  I could not believe that the fit was too tight.  I could zip it up but there was no room for movement.  Now I ask, how can there be such a discrepancy in sizing between COLORS.  I had to return the jacket.  I would have reordered the blue jacket in a large, but I would not have been able to receive the special pricing deal that was offered originally.  Very disappointed."
good to check travel items....
"These are just ok, not great but not terrible.  I was hoping for a little more support, but my instep hurt me after wearing them all day.  My orthoheel sandals are much better, will buy them again next time."
"Fits well enough, not the way I'd like though. Rides up and tucks under the front. Was hoping they'd be a little longer. Washed before wearing and the black one faded dramatically. Super soft, surprisingly absorbent."
Bag is starting to tare in certain places.
Stretchy material feels nice but they're waaaay too big for me.
"Runs small and narrow. This is a 9-Wide; my size is 8.5 Regular. That is what I got first, and had to send it back, exchanging for a 1/2 larger size, wide hiking shoes. The only reason I got this brand again, because I like the design, and it is a dark color.
I have several other Keen hiking shoes, they fit perfectly, and I wear them all day for work (I am running around 9 hours/day in a grocery store)."
Runs VERY small. I bought a medium and I usually purchase a small in other brands of hoodies and they are perfect. This medium looks and fits like an extra small.
A little tighter than other Nike's. Buy a size bigger.
"The shoes are very pretty.  Unfortunately, at the end of the day, the feet hurt.  They don't have much cushion."
"The kimono style wrap itself is gorgeous! Good quality sewing and stitching, beautiful bright colors. But it is cut VERY small. It is not a loose, long and flowy wrap. It is cut to be worn like an open fronted suit jacket. And in all honesty, while I purchased this for it's loose, flowing coverage I still really like it. When worn with a tank or camisole parked with a pair of tailored dress pants/capris it looks fantastic. I went to a professional training seminar in it."
"I bought these for a one time event and they fit well.  The color in the photo is accurate.  I was disappointed that they seemed to unravel slightly at the seam, but I guess you get what you pay for."
Within a week the fabric under the arm tore. I sewed it up myself and now its fine but the stitching wasn't all that great to begin with.
The fabric is very thin.  I needed a red t-shirt quickly and it was inexpensive.  I didn't expect much and I got what I paid for.
They are cool but they really don't fit small children's shoes...especially if they have narrow feet. I really like the concept though!
"I don't want you to get the wrong Idea abut these with me only giving it three stars. The fit and construction of these are actually excellent and I have bought several pairs of them.

The reason I am only giving these three stars is they never seem to last longer than six months.

My Wife claims I have a fabric destruction field about my body."
"it is longer tan the picture, it looks nice, im trying to make it shorter, hope that will  salve it. it looks a lil bit like the pic, but not a lot of complains with the price."
little stretch...therefore too small.
"This shoe is so beautiful, I waited for my size for more than a year. I ordered a 1/2 size bigger than my foot but the point still burn my toes. I'm still keeping it though."
Ordered a half size larger like other reviewers recommended and they were too big
"Smaller than I thought so had to return, but seemed comfortable!"
"Great looking shoes but I was a bit shocked when I pulled the insoles out to insert a pair of Dr. Scholls insoles. There are two rivets which are raised with rough jagged edges See picture. The rivets can't be felt with the insoles installed, but I can certainly see how the rivets could grind into the insoles over a short period of time. I've decided to keep the shoes and hope the rivets don't create issues for my insoles and ultimately my feet. I'd give them 4 stars if it weren't for this issue."
"It is beautiful i like it, but it's not free size. It's large, also the material is not that good, doesn't have the good price for this material."
"These shoes are very comfy, soft, and warm... as long as I am sitting.

The bottoms of these shoes are very narrow so my feet (especially my heels) kind of slide to the outside of the shoe when I'm walking.  This is not too much of an issue because I plan on using these as only house slippers, but I think this sliding effect would be annoying if I were to do a lot of walking in these."
Doesn't fit like expected. The stomach area was fairly loose to be a form fitting garment. That area is the problem area so but it usually the tightest
way smaller than expected.
"It's an ok shirt. Just looks a bit generic and not as appealing as the pictures. But this isn't a mark against the company because I bought a long sleeve shirt of the same brand and it's super top quality. It's a hit and miss when buying clothes online. However, I'm keeping this because it makes for a nice work shirt."
"The belt was a gift for my mom. The color is excellent, as described.
The construction is sturdy, (stitching intact), however, my mom feels that the quality of the belt itself is rather cheap.

My mother wears a size M and the amount of belt left is about 3-5 inches. Enough to pull the remainder of the belt through the first loop on the jeans.

Hope this review helps you with your purchasing descisions :)"
These shoes are smaller in size than traditional Crocs in length and width
these shoes are very large. I couldn't return it because I live in south korea.
"This product is fine, but it didn't suit our needs. It really is more for displaying for sales rather than for personal use, I think. My daughter asked me to return it and get one of the smaller ones from Kloud City."
"Its pretty and nice for summer, but the side splits are way too high for this to be a modest dress."
"Cool shirt but, for a large, it fits like a small. The quality is poor and there was a hole on the side. It was a Christmas gift so I made it work by stitching it up myself. :( My boyfriend loves it or he really loves me because he didn't complain. lol I'd buy it again once they add an extra layer of fabric."
"These look like great shoes....for some people?  For some reason, on my feet the rear part of the top (where you see the little loop thing sticking out) is way too far back for me and really worries at my leg.

Had to send them back--a shame, really like the look and felt comfie when not walking!"
"I really liked the feel of these briefs and I especially loved the low rise waist line. They fit great before and after washing. My only complaint is that the legs are very short and if they are worn during exercise or a run, the friction can become very irritating so I deducted a star.

I took off another star because I asked the vendor for a longer leg version of this same brief. I was directed to a version of this brief with a longer leg that turned out to be nothing like these briefs, except for the material. The other version has different seams which ride up your back side, a higher waistline which I hated, and they don't come in black. Basically, NOT the longer leg version of this."
"Super disappointed. This bowtie is for my son, for my wedding and in the picture it matches our colors perfectly, but when I received it, it's more of a light mint. Great bowtie, just feel a bit let down by false advertising on the color."
"I found these sandals to run kind of small.  I had trouble closing the buckle on the side and couldn't just slip them on. They're cute, but didn't work for me."
The wig was a great price but I am very disappointed in the color. I bought this for a poison ivy cosplay as it appeared it was a deeper red and when I got the wig it was more of a Ariel the mermaid red.
"Love the design and the bow, but fingers fit pretty tight."
these also run a little large and have a tendency to stretch out after a few hours.  I'm going to wash them in hot water and dry them in a hot dryer to see if I can shrink them a little.  but they are comfortable.  nice soft denim.
Easily mis-shapen and the silver tone wears off in about 2 months
Nice tee but runs small
"Well, I expected small, so ordered a half size down, but because of style and my narrow foot, should of ordered a full size down.  Will probably return unfortunately.  Was ordering for a costume, and still can't hold on my feet. BUT the did arrive so quickly I should have time to get them exchanged, hopefully!"
"Just received new shoes today. Sizing was off for keen shoes. Length was spot on but normal width or toe box was extremely narrow. Keen are known for their wider tor box, these are are not. Style and look and comfort are great tho. Have had keen shoes in the past that need a serious break in period  hopping these break in and loosen up in the toe box."
"The boot stretchers are great... made out of wood but second application on my boot, the plastic broke that stretches the width of the foot.  It comes in pairs and I only needed one so I have been extra careful not to break the other one.  That part is very weak while the other parts are excellent quality."
Could not wear them but seemed nice and comfortable if your foot is not narrow.
"The pros: comfort
The cons: can aggravate PUPPS (pregnancy belly rash)"
"The sandals are a little heavy, not very flexible to walk in for very long."
The hat is excellent. A touch small for me but very wearable. I know next time to go for one size bigger.
"Jeans fit expected, but they came in with an odor and it took 2 washes to dissipate the smell."
We love Keen sandals but these have never been my favorite sneakers. They are way too rigid for kids feet! Not healthy for foot growth at all. So glad my daughter hated them and returned them.
Not quite what I expected but it works
"I received these today, and love the way they look. They are very cute shoes. However I cannot comfortably get my foot into these. I typically wear a size 8 1/2, I got the 9 and they are very small and uncomfortable. I am going to return and try the size 10. I hope they fit!!!"
Run small and quality is not good.
"Look good at first but shrink every time that you wash and dry them. I am now wearing them as ""hand me downs"" and I am a petite xs."
Needs cushion insole.
THE ONLY REASON I AM ONLY GIVING 3 STARS...WHEN YOU WASH THESE (ACCORDING TO THE PRODUCT DIRECTIONS-HAND WASH...COLD...LAY FALT TO DRY) THEY SHRINK...I CAN STILL WEAR THEM...BUT...I AM BARELY 5' TALL...SO IF YOUR TALL...I WOULDN'T BUY THESE.  THAT BEING SAID...THEY ARE THIN...PERFECT FOR LAYERING...WHICH IS WHAT I WANT...I WANTED THEM LONG...BUT THEY WILL STILL WORK.  THEY ARE WELL MADE AND THE COLORS ARE TRUE TO DESCRIPTION.  ALL IN ALL...WORTH THE PRICE.
"The dress fit ok, but it was not the same when I checked it online."
I should have looked up Rose Gold IP before I purchased.  It means it is ion plated. After 1 week the color faded but it is still a nice gold color.  For $1.99 it wasn't a bad purchase.  I love the fit and the thickness and width. Just a little disappointed that the color has already faded.
"Pretty, but too small and I ordered the larger size. I gave it away."
Not overly padded or comfortable.
Makes long dance section comfortable .
"This costume served its purpose.  It's really nothing more then a t-shirt with a cheap peace of cloth sewn to the back and a cheap mask.  The shirt was smaller then expected, but all in all it worked out OK."
They were comfortable but unfortunately I'm down to one pair because the other two got destroyed in the washer and dryer I recommend handwashing these
"Wish they were a little bit bigger,I'm a small person, hurts somewhat on my nose, may get better with time!"
Somewhat stiff.
Cute fits a little big for a small
"My little girl really likes it, but the ballerina broke mid-torso & has required super glue. She's held intact, so I'm hoping she'll last. Cute jewelry box."
"Fit ok,not very comfortable"
"Originally ordered on 06/04/18 and worn almost every day in our pool up until this weekend (07/29/18) when a large hole developed in the back of the shorts. Gave 3 stars because before it began snagging, which is where the hole came from, my daughter loved the colors and style. She is wanting me to order a new set but Im not planning on ordering this one again since it really only lasted 2 months."
"My wife has to be careful when wearing this wrap dress as it unwraps when wind blows or when she is sitting down.
As the material is polyester, it is of a smooth material so it unwraps quite easily.
Other than that, it is rather comfortable.
She doesn't like the design as much and hopes that it could be of a trendier pattern.
The idea of a wrap dress is welcomed as she will be able to breastfeed in it more easily."
"So everyone has been saying it's a bit small
And they are right. If you want it to have a bit of a ""hoochie"" fit then it's not bad but if you are looking for comfy ""pajama like"" fit then I'd say to even go up 2 sizes.
I'm 5'6, 132 lbs and I got a medium.  I like a tiny fit but I think I would have preferred a large. It's just a little too up my butt. Lol
But it's a cheap but soft long John material. I remember the reviews saying that the buttons fall off easily so i was careful with it and so far everything is fine.
I mean at the end of the day I didn't spend a bunch of money on it so I'm not upset about it."
The sandals are ok. Not supper comfortable. The material makes my feet sweat. They fit a bit tight.
Amall
"A lot smaller he expected, but it does work well for quick trips where you need only the bare minimum"
"I love crossbody bags since they free up my hands when walking. However, the strap adjustment on this bag is kind of clunky, and while I love the RFID blocking feature, the compartments are not my favorite. I'll be trading this model up when I find a viable replacement."
"Very nice and decent quality for the price, but very small around the torso. I even sent it back and exchanged for an ex-large but that fit exactly the same."
"The color is not a dark navy blue, and the scarf doesn't seem as long as the one pictured.  I won't return it, though, because it will still work."
it docent even have a moth and the screen has like 6 scratches
Light pink color is a bit sheer- I bought a few colors for my daughter to just wear around.
"Looked really good for about 2 years, then the choosing on the ring started to flake and peel off. The base is the same color, but no where as shiny as the coating."
"Using for backpacking and can fit a decent amount in them, and several of them in my back pack. For my wardrobe at least the black mesh is too dark. I can't pull stuff out of my backpack without having to go through more than I'd like."
It boder me in the up back border...
"I haven't actually worn these other than trying them on at home as it's June and it's flip flop weather. The looks are great, and the sizing is a wee bit off as I'm a solid size 7 and felt urged to go for 38 and they're a smidge too big, but probably better to be too big than too small. One thing that I don't like about them, and it's a personal preference, is that the heel is solid and clunks - in a way that you make a lot of noise like you're wearing cowboy boots or heels and there's no way people can't hear you not coming down the hallway. I prefer to be little quieter and softer in my footing. I got the grey, and it's a nice colour. In darker lights they could be dark green (nice, not icky). I may change my review in the fall once boot season returns, but overall, these are different from the run-of-the-mill styling, and very cute."
Huge huge huge. Could have fit three people in this robe.  Sent back for refund. Was very sad because it was well made.
"It feels old.
Watch the screen. The older one, the older one.
It is not becoming on my little daughter to ..."
"I thought it was kind of small, but then again I have never worn this kind. Anyways I did like the material and style. Very cute!! Next time I'll order a size"
Seems to shrink when I wash it so now it's to short as I usually like to get longs when they are available
Tight. But decoration is bright...OUCH MY TOES!!
"My 12-year old was a bit disappointed in this jacket, although it really is just fine.  (I think he had something different in mind.)  The ""leather"" is a bit cheaper than I had anticipated, and the jacket does seem to run small.  My son usually wears a size 14, but this is just a tad small.  He won't get much wear out of it.  But, the price is so reasonable it's not a bad deal."
"The shoes are made really well, the entire thing feels like quality, the issue i have with it is the elastic that holds the tongue down is really tight, after about an hour of wearing it my feet became unbearable, which at first i didn't expect because the shoe actually fit me perfectly, if the elastic wasn't in there the shoe would be great.
The other issue i have with this purchase is the company, i requested a return and explained the shoe was too tight and uncomfortable and they sent me an email saying ""We would like to offer you $6 refund. Would you be able to keep it? Maybe you can resell it to your friend. If you do not want it anymore please send it back to"" now i don't even mind that i have to pay about $20 to ship it back because they refused to give me a return label, but seriously, offering me $6 to keep something i don't want or telling me to sell it to a friend, if i was told that in a store i would be pissed at whom ever said it, maybe don't treat your customers that way."
feels like your walking flat footed
"I like the look of the boot, but runs very small.  I'm normally a size 9 and ordered 9 1/2.  Unfortunately, I'll return instead of going for a size 10 (have never needed a 10).  I believe the running small comes in the width, although ordering a 1/2 size up was cutting a bit close on length as well."
"These shoes are a little short.  I can wear them but the comfort level goes down as the day goes on.  Also, the soles are relatively thin, so I can slightly feel the things I'm walking on.  The look is great and I am going to keep them, but I wish they were just a tad longer."
These were very cute shoes but the width of the shoes was a little thin. I returned them because my feet hung over the edge. And I didn't think ordering a size up would help the situation.
"My new jeans are immediately comfortable and cozy as I put them on. The material is soft and yielding and they feel familiar. Yet they give me a ""mom butt"" and fit very poorly throughout the thighs and rear end. I'm going to do my best to shrink them but, alas, they might end up being Stay at Home Jeans"
Dress was ok. Material a bit too thick for me
"Its a very cute bracelet, and thats why i gave three stars. It arrived quickly, but fell apart quickly. It was strung entirely too tight and one of the turtles fins broke off."
"I would consider these a bit more closely related to tights then traditional socks. The first pair I tried on, one sock is too tight while the other is so loose it sags. Upon washing said pair in the washing machine for the first time they came out looking a sad mess. Several strings and elastic bits have pulled through.
They are ok, as in I'm happy I got them on sale. If want them to last, either hand wash or put in with your dedicates."
"The leather is quite comfortable, but the ankle part is very narrow and I tried hard to put it on."
"They got a hole in them the first time worn, which is disappointing."
"It's a beanie what do you expect. It fits alright, but needs to be a little bigger."
"The wig was garbage, but had to return outfit."
"They are adorable but far too small. My daughter wears a size 1. Normally size1 is a little big but these boots are very small for a size 1. They look like a toddler size. I wonder if it was sized incorrectly.. I am going to have to return them. If my daughters wants a larger size, I will definitely get them. They are cute."
Felt much like a very supportive flip-flop.  Less like a sandal.
Way to big for my sons ears
This could look very nice...IF it fit properly!
"The sweater was a big hit at the party, it runs a little small, and one of the sleeves started to ravel at the wrist. Concerning the price I thought the quality would have been a little better."
"This skirt has a nice pattern. It fits, but very awkwardly.  It really doesn't flare out, like in the picture.  I had to send it back.  I think this skirt would work for a size 0/2.  I wear size 4/6 in skirts."
"The boot leather felt thin, the straps across the top flapped loosely and seemed as if they would easily catch on various obstacles.  Boot fit was loose in length and super tight in width.  I do have a wide foot, but order a 1/2 size larger boot which usually compensates.  In this case, it did not.  These boots were very stylish, however."
my daughter was super excited to get theses but was disappointed when the medium was way to large for her but the seller was super nice and refunded our money and told us to keep the shorts since it would have cost us more to send them back then what they are worth we are hoping in a few years she will grow into them they are super cute and the fabric was soft
Im 51 125ibs and a 32DDD. Usually I prefer a medium because i like things loose. This was cute but i should have got a large because the lace atop just short of my but. I would have to wear spandex under neath if i wore as a dress.
"I ordered an XL based on some other reviews, and do wear between a L and XL, however, it is much longer and wider than expected.  The fabric is nice and soft, so I do like that."
"For $20 you can't really expect much. The middle in front seems to be way to close together making the bra look weird. Feeling is light, kinda like memory foam and kinda throws me off. These will be hanging around the house or yard work bras..."
"The sides, of the purse  are unfinished. The whole purse should be the exact same color.  That's my only complaint.  It'll work, though, if you want to bring a pop of color to an outfit."
"Very comfortable I just didn't really like the Mary Jane look on my foot.  Also I just didn't like the thick white heel.  However, very lightweight but not stylish - at least not my style."
"Really cute swimsuit. Unfortunately, this didn't fit me properly. I don't think I have a long torso, but this swimsuit was just way too short for me. If I pulled the top up to a comfortable position, it gave me a wedgie. If I covered the bottom properly my bosom would nearly fall out. Otherwise, the individual sections fit me perfectly, just not long enough. I wish it did fit because it's super cute! I did notice that it seems to attract lint really easily though."
"I love these shoes, and I want to give them a five star rating for stylish, solid construction, nice stacked heel for support, but they are just a bit too narrow in the toes.  Enough so I can't wear them all night.  Major downside.  If I knew I only had to walk in, sit and walk out, they would last all night. My size is 11M.  Normally Clarks are my Go-To shoe for comfort, unfortunately I can't give these shoes my same seal of approval."
"Great shoes, just the right foot did not fit , was just to tight at the top."
Kind of loose on the feet. I don't really enjoy wearing them because they are loose.
"love the fit, seems like fabric starting to fall apart.  I currently use the bare naked and i like its fabric durability better but i like this fit better.  the inner thigh area on this product is coming apart  been about 5 washes)  comfort level is best i have EVER had. i only bought 1 pair to test. agian i already use a similar top quality underwear and heard about this one so wanted to try. i will not be switching over. even though the fit is amazing the durability has me concerned."
"These tee shirts run slightly larger than their white crew neck counterparts, or at least the group I received does.  The neck sizes are definitely larger than I would expect from a medium tee shirt."
"So tight, I'm always a medium but this made me feel like a stuffed sausage"
"I ordered these walking shoes 1/2 size larger than I normally wear.  They came in and fit just right.  If I had to do it again, I would order them a whole size larger to make room for thick socks.  They are very comfortable and plenty of traction.  I would give it a 5 star rating if rhey had disclosed the shoes run a size smaller.  Good price, good shoe."
The sandals looks well and fit well but are not comfortable. The sole of the shoes are to hard and it's difficult to walk with them.
"Planned to have as a dressing outfit but it came too large for an M, so its now a sleeper"
A good belt with a quality feel.
"I think I'm the only reviewer who doesn't find these comfortable, I guess because I was using a super soft modal blend before.  Switching to this after that is like getting used to recycled toilet paper after the ultra-plush stuff (or maybe that's not a good analogy because you only use toilet paper so many times a day as opposed to wearing something).  I've had these for over a year and find I don't pull them out of the drawer very often; I'd rather just do the laundry more often and use the ones I prefer.  I even prefer regular old Hanes to these.

Anyway, these are definitely not sexy but they function and don't cost much.  Eh."
it was ok i love the bathing suit but i was kinda small on me
Very thin but good for hot weather. Too large but washed in hot water improved the fit.
Love bling!
they didn't stay in my kids shoes. My son lost all of his. i wouldn't but them again or recommend them .
Pretty flimsy. Came crumpled in a bag all wrinkled and overall poorly made. Looks good from afar not up close. Super thin and see through.
"This bra is perfect for a short run (5-6 miles) or working out at the gym. However, I am runner and end up with chaffing to the inside of my upper arms and underneath breasts from the underwire if I do anymore than 8 miles."
"The description says it's 100meter water resistant, the watch is just 50 meter water resistant. This one of the most important features that I look for before I buy a watch."
Hard to read due small width and scribbled writing.
"Fits smaller than the size. I matched all her same size shoes to this shoe, the bottom matches but then you look inside and you can see why it isn't the same size as the other shoes. Point is, order the next size up. The fuzzy also sheds like a pup."
"Good when I'm playing, but these are NOT shoes to walk around in"
"The plastic is thin and tears easily; the credit cards, license, etc., are hard to remove from the slots."
I ordered a 7 1/2 size in the silver and they are way too big.  The silver is very pretty. The design is lovely and the heel height is just right for me.  I would like to order again but not sure what size to order.
"I wasn't sure of the size so I got both medium and small. I usually wear small but I thought maybe a looser top might be more comfortable. This medium was too big for me so I returned it, keeping the small."
"Muffin top still pokes through but that is not the jeans fault.  I thought if I bought the size I always get they would be a little big since they were ""boyfriend"" jean. They fit the same as my other jeans maybe a tad smaller.  Good length."
being 5'inches tall it did not really look has good has on the model. love it anyway
SERVE IT PURPOSE
This top was larger than expected even though I ordered my normal medium.  I am going to a small then it should be perfect.  Otherwise a cute top.
"Looks a bit quickly made around the bottom of the shoe, and it scratches up my Achilles' tendon really badly until I finally wore the shoes down a bit (and even now it still rubs uncomfortably, so I can't wear ankle socks with it), but they're still nice shoes, and I can't find many other shoes with this design and color, so it'll have to do."
"Ran a little small, but overall great jeans"
great waterproof / winter boots extremely comfortable but in fall and my feet are sweating
"Quality is ok. Come along with nice box.
But the strap is smaller than expectation.
Overall ok.
Actually I bought 2"
Cute for the price but wore it once  for about 4 hours and its tarnished already
"Looks great on, but not very comfortable.  The material is sort of scratchy without any give."
"the height of the sox is somewhat low for a crew even though it is clear it is ""short"" the weave is also rather weak as I have had two already starting to unravel."
"It seems a nice sneaker, but I wore today and it bothered my left foot a lot.  The sneaker it is narrow.  I don't have a wide foot, neither narrow.  I will have to buy another one."
"The first pair we received had the loop/handle broken off. So after exchanging them for a new pair we are mostly pleased with them. I would say that they are on the narrow side. My son has wide feet but when it's really cold outside, we want our boy to wear an extra layer of wool socks to help keep his feet warm, and they are a struggle to get on that way. These would be perfect for a warmer wet day, with just regular socks underneath. Less ideal for winter weather, but definitely do-able. My son does not complain once they are on and serve their purpose of keeping his feet dry. The design looks a little cheap, but I still like them. Hence, a 3 out of 5. Nothing exceptional, but good enough to keep, especially when these will only fit for such a short period of time. Note: I also purchased a pair of Hatley rainboots and I would say they are comparable in quality; ranking the Hatley ones slightly better if needed. The Hatley ones had nicer designs, but unfortunately did not have the size we needed so we decided to keep the Western Chief boots. In both versions, I wish they had bigger threads for more grip."
"Construction is shoddy. I've already had a button fall off. The stitching at the pockets is coming loose, I will need to repair soon. The fabric itself is of a rough, lower quality. I would not purchase again."
"I gave the shoes 3 out of 5 because they were too wide. Other than that, the shoe is pretty and comfy."
"The fit was good and the shoes look good, but they rub really badly at the top of my heel. Wish I could fix that problem without messing up the shoe. Otherwise they were as expected and shipped fast."
"very still, hopefully it'll loosen up a bit with use. However, I got the 38"" belt, and it barely fits - so go one or two sizes up if you want more than a tiny sliver of belt to pull through,."
I'm giving it 3 but could be less. I'm trying to be reasonable here for others. For me it's a 2 simply because the reset button has changed. My old timex ironman 30 lap watch you would have to hold the reset on the timer to actually reset it with a delay. This was great just Incase you were unaware you stopped the timer. Now if you're unaware you stopped the timer and press it stop once the time will reset very quickly. I officiate sports and sometimes you can press stop twice by accident. If that happens your timer will go back to reset. So I would always need to keep an eye on the time and not the sport. For officiating this watch doesn't cut it like the others. The other functions are fine and I do like the Velcro. Shame they changed the reset option.
Sculpted right shirt even in plus size
"My daughter needed it for a school show.  And she was very cute in it.  It seems well built, like it would last forever but it is polyester and we probably will never wear it again."
"I had been wanting this dress for a while because it's so cute and I love the style, but I just didn't like the way it fit me so I returned it! I am thin but hippy and the dress shifted up when I walked causing it to pucker at the hips (which only made me look even wider) and then it flared at the bottom which I just really don't like, personally!! I think it's a great dress, just not for me! I definitely recommend buying it though, it was good quality and color and style!!"
I gave the shoes three stars because they actually look good.  My son complained that they squeezed his toes and he refused to wear them after three days.  What a waste of money.
These were way too big for me. I'm a size ten and they were too long and awkward looking. I will be returning these because I find them really ugly and too big.
this costume should not say fits 4T. my son is 4T and I could barely get it on him. returned it immediately.
"The ankle strap even on the tightest loop is a little loose and the backs of my ankles get a little scraped if I wear these all day, but other than that they're adorable and durable!"
It was ok. The leather has a faded look.
It is not very soft.
"I wear a 7 but ordered the 8 because of the size chart.  They were just a bit too large but 7 would have been too small. The issue is that the buckle is really flimsy and after one day of wearing them  I was very concerned the buckle was going to break so I returned.
If the buckle was better made I would have kept them."
Its good but not as soft as expected..
This is not the best fit for me as I need elastic in the waist due to a liver transplant.  But it is a durable jean and does not lose its color very  much  at all.  Legs are nice width.
"Inexpensive tennis socks. Pretty much what I expected, but could be thicker, more durable."
feels cheap.
"I usually wear a medium, so I ordered a medium. I don't think they size these like maternity clothes. For instance, if you are normally a medium, you wear medium maternity clothes because they account for your bigger than normal state. These bras are sized like normal bras.. that is, you probably need a bigger size than you are used to wearing."
this slipper is soft and comfortable and fits well. but it's a lot heavier and the sole is stiffer than i hoped. i hoped for something like crock kind of sole with a soft top. but it's more like a dress shoe kind of sole.
2 sizes bigger than we expected! I ordered a different set of bloch jazz from our studio and they were size 5. Size 5 in these were way too big. Order a size down.
Okay shirts for what they are used for. They run a little small in my opinion and they are thick and a bit scratchy.
Holds my money and my bank/credit/id cards. Hopefully my cards can't be scaned.
"Had to re-lace it, but it fit okay. Wish it were a little longer though."
"I liked the shirt very much, but it did not fit across the bust. It was too tight. I ordered the medium, but a large would have been too big everywhere else. I am a 34D if that helps."
"I love that the sandal is very comfortable for walking however, I do wish that they had a half size. I wear regular size 6 and I ordered size 6 and I can tell it's half inch bigger. I thought about replacing with size 5 then my toe would fall off. I really wish they had size 5.5 to fit perfectly."
"I had compared the dimensions on the site to a fleece jacket I had and the Condor came up a little short (less than 1/2 inch though) in each dimension compared to the fleece dimensions.  I ordered the 3X (there is no 4X).  It is a nice jacket, I just do not like the way it drapes on the body.  The Spandex does not really allow it drape anyway.  I am 6 feet plus and about 260 pounds.  It does fit snugly but I think it is really the Spandex.  If I could relax the Spandex a bit, I would really like this jacket.  I love the number of pockets, especially the fore arm pocket.  I use it for my ID card.  I love the hood with the visor.  I wear it to work over a tee shirt and polo shirt normally.  I would say it would be comfortable no lower than the high 40s F by itself.  You could extend that if you wore a fleece or sweater underneath.  It is more comfortable in the 50s F though.  I have worn it in some pretty good wind and rain storms.  Wind intrusion is not a problem.  So far, the rain has not penetrated the material either.  The slash pockets are a little high up for me though.  It could be an inch or 2 longer in the overall length.  It could also be a bit more packable.  I wanted it to roll up in the bottom of my work back pack for when I travel.  Does not really lend itself to that though."
"Once I get these on, the comfort, fit, and durability are great. But getting them on is another matter. It is the correct size (11) and fit right once I get them on.  I finally bought a long shoe horn as I kept crushing down the back and my finger wasn't enough to hold the heel part open enough to fit my heel in. Once they are on, however, you don't have to worry about them slipping off when going up and down hills. Also warm in snow and cold temperatures. I won't buy them again, due to the difficulty getting them on, but that may just be me."
"The shoes are comfy, bit I am already seeing the strips of decoration coming unraveled. They are less expensive than the other shoes that are very similar to them. The shoes are also way more comfortable."
Great mask but not made to fit girls
"It's a nice looking bag, but it's stiff leather that is lined in green canvas, and obviously made in China or Pakistan. The strap is very, very thin leather and looks like it will break in time. The ""smell"" reported in other reviews is there, but it is the smell of processed leather that is found in all leather that is tanned in third world countries. There are several inside pockets and the flap is a full flap reminiscent of old mail delivery bags./ It is a decent bag for the money, but it's NOT a Kenneth Cole Messenger bag either in look or quality."
These are not the old school Vans- these are more akin to Keds... TOO NARROW and NO padding! Boo
Here's my issue-when I placed my order I chose hi-cut not briefs! I've even gone back and checked the product again against my order and I did not order briefs so I am not happy with the fact I was sent a different type so buyer's beware. However they are a nice soft cotton.
"The headdress looks fantastic. Received many compliments on it. However, it doesn't seem to be holding up very well. The glue is coming apart in places. Great for a party or two, but may need to retire after that."
This is really cute but totally runs small. I ordered a 2x (I'm a 14) and it felt like I was squeezing into a Large! Order a couple sizes larger than what you are.
"I think these pants are for bigger bodies. I have an athletic frame and thin long legs, and these pants are quite baggy."
"Not a heavy flannel like my previous Legendary Whitetails flannel purchase. This is a light weight shirt, don't expect it to keep you warm."
"I ordered a 36""  but it measures 35"" . Nice thought. I like it"
"For what this is, Londontown's nail hardener is overpriced.  First of all, the packaging says may be used as a base coat.  For me, that didn't quite work because, having heavily ridged nails, this polish did NOT apply smoothly, and did not allow me to leave my nail with complete coverage of polish over my nails.  So that meant I had to apply another brand of base coat over that in order to be able to finish my manicure.

As far as hardening properties, can't say this did much of anything.  Some of my nail are fairly pliable, and even with this hardener they basically stayed the same after application.

Can't say I can recommend Londontown nail hardener and base coat, and especially not at THIS price."
"Keep in mind that this is not an official US Army licensed product. I knew that beforehand, but ordered it because I could customize it.  With that being said, the embroidered Army logo is not as sharp and crisp as what you would find on the official licensed shirts.  As far as customizing, its okay but could only be customized on the left side below the logo and not on the right side.  The shirt material is okay but is not made from a thick material like what you would expect from most polo shirts. For how many washes can this shirt endure is unknown.  Would I place another shirt order? No."
"Not to be used every day.  Definitely turns a funny color (not the stone, just the ring itself) right a way."
Did not care for these at all. The coloring was faded and quality was poor.
"For the price, these aren't bad sandals. They do run large. I ordered a 9 (i'm an 8.5) and they were huge on me. I ended up giving them to my mom who is a 10 and they fit perfectly. The padding is comfortable so you shouldn't get blisters and you can adjust a bunch of different straps for a custom fit. Just maybe size down."
"I'm a true 7.5 narrow. These shoes were the perfect width, but they were not long enough, I need a 1/2 size up.  My toes were almost hitting the shoe."
Slightly itchy thing fabric. Not worth more than $10.
"Considering the large size of the watch, it is comfortable to wear.  The downside of such large watch face is that it get bumped very easily.  It is more difficult to program than other watches I've owned.  The buttons are large to match the large watch face, so the outward facing buttons get bumped easily.  One of the outward buttons is used for changing time zones.  Several times a week I am having to change the time zone back to my time zone because of that button getting bumped."
"Good service, bras not the best"
not a great quality. but they are fine for a little while.
"I bought these for my girlfriend.  I ordered a size 8 which she usually wears. They were a bit too short.  Thanks to the great Amazon exchange policy I returned them for a size 9.  She is a long-time ""heel wearer"" and found these to the most comfortable heels she has ever worn.  They are a really beautiful sharp eye-catching shoe!!"
Quality was good but it was waaaay to big.  I am a 25 inch waist and usually fit a small. I ordered a small in this and it was unwearable. The size was more like a medium.
"nice sweats, but they do run small."
"The watch itself is pretty good, but I over estimated my ability to quickly tell time with a watch with no numbers on it.  That's my bad.  However, the watch is very pretty and looks great on my wrist."
"These boots are way too big. I wear a 12 in most shoes and boots but I am swimming in these. When I walk in them, they feel very loose and I feel like I'm going to trip over my own feet. I recommend getting at least a half size smaller than usual."
I use these as my everyday earrings. Comfortable and fun.
SOCK WANTS TO ROTATE AROUND MY FEET. PRICE IS GOOD BUT YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. AS LONG AS I HAVE A SHOE ON THEY ARE OK. ALSO VERY THIN ABOVE ANKLE. WILL NOT HOLD UP IN MY OPINION.
This is not a dress. More like a shirt. Or something you can wear with leggings. When i tried to put it on after buying a large. it was a little snug and i broke the strape trying to put it on. Im just going to take it to the cleaners because it should be an easy fix and the shirt is reall cute. Other than that no complaints.
The colors are very pretty. Unfortunately there is nothing natural about the fabric. Its definitely not cotton or even a cotton blend. Ill probably give it away.
"Jacket is true to the size.  I am US Medium to Large (I wear it sort of tight due to my physical fitness).  I ordered US L and it fit real tight and nice.  I don't like mine big so if you are looking to wear it with a bit of room, then I'd order two sizes up.  Jacket is ok.  It really isn't great quality but then again it's style is second to none."
"fits tight, however a real good deal and shoe..."
Cup size is very small so it didn't fit me but the quality was nice and would fit someone with a cup size below C.  Amazon and this seller were efficient in processing the return and refund.
There is no support so this is not for any woman w a b cup or bigger really. Too bad bb
"Shirt showed up on time. I ordered a xxl when I wear XL and the shirt was still to small.
I won't order again"
these are really cute... preppy... but the string on the shorts ripped out the first time I tied it... it must not have been sewn in very tightly or at all.  Plus the shorts are really high waisted ... they fit just below my bustline... I like a more low hanging short especially for sleepwear
"Its a hoodie. Comfortable to wear, however, the hood comes to a very sharp point. Could bring about awkward situations."
"The XXL fit like a womens L  & fits long, before washing. The fabric is thin, but the design is original & fun."
"Good pricing, showed up in individual bags instead of on cardboard holder as shown in the pictures. Already lost the back to one earring though "
Very long compared to shoulder and bust size-(too small of a bust with regards to length and width of bottom).
"This is a knockoff of a much more expensive dress from the Pretty Dress Company.  I wasn't expecting much given the price difference, but it was okay.

It doesn't feel quite as elegant as the pictures look, but having never seen the non-knockoff dress in person I can't compare the two side by side.  The print is accurate if a little bit lighter than the picture (the green is less rich).  There is a built in crinoline inside to give a bit of poof to the shape, but it doesn't do a huge amount since it's fairly thin.

The fit was very size accurate and there is a bit of stretch to the material.  I ordered the XL and it was about 21"" across the bust and 17.5"" across the waist.

I ended up returning this because it still looked pretty cheap compared to what I was expecting from the picture, but it's not a terrible little dress and seemed well enough made."
"They are really cute. They are silky with lace at the toes. I have not have any lace tear like I read in a previous review. But, these have not been ""no show."" I like to wear a liner with flats, heels, and sometimes other shoes for which I do not want socks to show. These have shown in all of my flats and heels. While I like them, and will keep them, I will have to find another product that is truly ""no show."""
Glad I ordered large! It was still too small. Cute though.
Price ok for three
"Not worth the price for me. Decently comfy but i was hoping the material would feel better. Slightly large to. Im a 29 waist, 6'1 and 150 so im not a big person but ive never had a small size underwear fit this big. I havnt dried them yet so well see! but decent underwear, not my favorite. These will be my workout boxers. Also the length is perfect. not short. i want to give them 4 stars but the price held me back"
Did not look like the pick and following their size chart these were way too big.
"Size seems short
but good value"
"The ankle and leg part was tight and there is no way I could get my pants into the boot, there was just no room to tuck in jeans.  The foot part of the boot seems true to size and  comfortable, although I can only wear them for about 15 minutes without feeling like the circulation to my foot was being affected due to the tight compressing on my ankle. The look of the boot is very nice. The boots were packaged with care in the buckle and snaps were protected. The top of the boot did  seem to have some sort of light padding which was a pleasant surprise. If you notice I use past tense ...  I really like the boots and I really wish it fit but I did have to return them because I just could not wear them for any length of time the tops and were just too tight."
These sneakers are super cute but heavy.  A toddlers shoes shouldnt be this heavy.  Im going to return them.
Cute. Overpriced. Runs large.
I was hoping to wear these in my classroom but they make my feet so sweaty! I was looking for zero drop shoes that would be comfortable while teaching. I couldn't find any cute looking shoes so I wanted to try these funky ones. They would be perfect minus the sweating aspect. Maybe others wouldn't have this problem.
"Cute shirt, fit pretty well and has held up through multiple wearings and washings."
"Really cute. Super small. Ok for this price, probably only get 1 or 2 uses out of them."
"I loved this dress. Nicely made and good material.. Fits to size and is flattering on bigger girls.. I'm 180, 5'5 size 18 jeans and got an XL.
The reason for the three stars was because it came with animal hair (cat or dog) on it right out of the plastic.. Gross.. The lost stars were for the fact that someone else had already done who knows with it THEN I got it uncleaned.. At least pick the fur off the returned clothes if you are going to resell a used clothing item!! A washing machine fixes it but Yuck !!!"
shoe is much much brighter in real life.  Comfortable fit but slightly large.
Bought as a gag gift to wear at an art opening. It was too messy -- the feathers will drop -- but lots of feathers in the boa. I'm going to repurpose it as the feather covering on a 6 foot tall crow.
"I have to admin I was very underwhelmed when these came. Regardless of the actual size measurements posted, the photos that are all over make these packing cubes in all kinds of colors look huge.  Instead they are very small.  I suppose it is actually my fault because I have looked at these so many times and when they were being offered at a really low price as an add on I jumped at the deal.  I was actually wanting to fill these and keep them under my bed but they are just not big enough to store much.  Don't get my wrong they are most likely perfect for putting your things in to separate in your suitcase or carry on (maybe shoes? socks undergarments) but I am glad I only paid 1/4 of the price they are asking for regularly because it was an ""add on"" deal.  The material kind of reminds me of a windbreaker.  They seem to be pretty sturdy and when I travel again I will probably take them with me to put presents in so the kids don't see it as soon as I open my suitcase or to pack my extra shoes away instead of using a plastic bag.  Do not expect something big like I did or you will be disappointed.  The large is about the size of a laptop but higher.  They are really not bad just not what I was expecting."
Blister city!
"I was a little disappointed that the large didn't fit. I am normally a medium, but sized up after reading the reviews. When I got it, it was so super tight, I had to squeeze into it. Luckily I bought it as a pajama shirt, so I wasn't too worried about it being tight. It loosens up after wearing it and it is definitely soft. It is also fairly sheer, definitely would need an under shirt if I were to wear it out in public."
"It fit as described, but there was too much bra for my friend's taste."
"These shorts looked super cute and comfy. Unfortunately, even though I picked a size based on the size chart and my measurements when they came they were at least one if not two sizes too big. As such, I never got to wear them and had to return them so I'm not able to give a more thorough review. Giving three stars because they still looked like good shorts, I'll probably repurchase and update this review once I get a pair that fits."
"Quality enough, but after like one wash it was like the torso would fit a very small person???  Come on, Hanes."
"It's beautiful and Ilove the material, but it runs way too small.. I had to gift it to my little cousin"
"nice fabric and not crazy clingy like many pattyboutik tops. It is a bit too long, however, so not as flattering as it could be."
They work for me as easy to slip on without lacing garden shoes.  I wish they had a little more padding.
"xxl, fit as a XXL should. Poly cotton blend."
review said the were a little large so i ordered one size smaller and it's a little tight
These really didn't fit me even thought the sizing suggested they would. I am a size 12 and they are too tight and don't come high enough. Will give them to a friend who is smaller.
didn't fit well and made me look like an elderly woman
"I am fit, strong and normal weight. I usually look good in jeans called ""slim"" ""skinny"" ""tight"", etc. I seek them out. These fit my butt and waist, but the legs are so slim I could barely pull them up. If you have any muscle development in your legs, these will be too tight. It is best to be slightly underweight. I had to return them."
too small and skinny
"I bought two pairs of Dickies recently. Unfortunately the carpenter pants we're WAY oversized in the leg area, though the waist and length were spot on. I feel like a kid from the 90's."
"A solid shoe, fits sort of loose. But a little heavy, not a moccasin at all. I returned mine."
"Great sandal.
I like the look and they are very comfortable
My gripe is that the elastic has lost its stretch after only 5or6weeks

I have had other chacos for years and they are still great."
These were likely not genuine birkenstocks. They were much larger than my directly sourced birks in this size. I replaced them with ones from the genuine dealer and noticed that the footbed lettering on the fakes was more printed on than stamped in. The sole was shiny plastic that did not match with genuine new birks. That being said they are pretty good fakes and you may not notice the difference
Rather thin shirt material. Fit slightly small.
"Shoes are very beautiful, workmanship and quality are very good. But the shoe is too small, especially in the front end is too narrow."
The boobs are just too big on this suit =(
"These are not as nice as they appear, the longer ones don't tighten very well and the piece with the clasp is too small. Out of the 4 only the skull piece fits comfortably and holds."
"These would have been great except they were huge. Silver Jeans are amazing, but it's getting harder to order from them as their sizing seems to be all over the place."
"I was looking for good quality business casual socks.  The assorted brown pack came in nice designs, however, after a few months of use and washing the material started feeling polyester-y and rough.  Given the price, it would seem in line with the performance, but was hoping they would last better."
returned too much money for what i was looking for
"More of a tunic than a shirt.  I ordered mocha what I received is a dark muddy grey.  Not even close to the color pictured.  I undersand some variation in color but this is very different.  It came with a black necklace made of super cheep plastic and it is so ugly, even my 6 year old won't use it as play jewelry.
On the plus side it is comfortable and it arrive 2 weeks earlier than expected."
got these shoes for my granddaughter she was a bit disappointed because they were too big but she will grow into them other than that I think she likes them they look sharp and hopefully will hold up well concidering the cost
The waist is too small. Might send it back or give it away.
I purchased several wicking shirts for an upcoming trip and this was my lease favorite because it was both more sheer and more boxy than the other brands. I would have liked it to be a little more fitted and flattering and not show the bra underneath so easily.
"The description says that they are brand-new in their original packaging, but mine arrived in a beat-up generic shoe box, and were hanging out in there without the TOMS box-- they were just chucked in there, loose.  So, no, these did not come in their original package, which makes them seem sketch.  I'm going to give them as a gift, so now it will look all weird when I give a pair of shoes that have already been removed from their box.  Oh well.  Hopefully they fit."
"Very Pretty - But - heavy - didn't fit well at the back.  Seemed to be a ridge there.  Not comfortable,  Didn't like at all.  Only kept because I didn't have others."
"It is made fairly well. The nightgown portion is a bit scratchy, but can be washed to help with that. It has elastic in the neck and sleeves, making it easy to wear. The fur is everywhere, but I didn't expect a really good quality, either. My only complaint is the mask is very misshapen. The package insert contains directions to use a hairdryer to heat up the mask to reshape it. I placed the mask on my wig form and tried to use my fingers and the hairdryer to get the bridge of the nose between the eyes to reshape. Ended up using a string tied between the eyes to get the correct (humped) shape. Doesn't seem to hold the shape. Black electrical tape will most likely hold it... granny glasses will disguise the tape. I'm using this costume as part of an illusion. Big, bad wolf in back, holding little Red Riding Hood (my upper body) in front."
"Not the most comfortable shoes, they did the job, but I would probably not buy another pair."
"To start off heels are heels. Either way you cut it, they're going to be painful at some point. After breaking these in they're ok as far as pain. The real issue was the zipper. Im so glad that i have amazon prime because the first pair I ordered came with a broken zipper. I immediately sent it back and reordered the shoe again. The second came with a similar problem though the zipper wasn't completely broken, the strip between the zipper and my foot was hanging down. I just ripped it out and went on about my night because I had to go. Besides the tolerable pain and zipper malfunction this shoe is ridiculously cute. I love the style and how it looks."
undersized
"Too large, way too long.  I washed them to try to shrink them, so I cannot return them.  Bummer."
not really good as i expected.
"as stated in other comments is too wide around the heals, heal grips you can use but be careful not to buy the gel ones, will give you blisters if its a sunny day."
"I like it, however its to big to wear."
They didn't last long looking new. The material is cheap.
"Unfortunately I received these a day too late. (had to cut nose ring out the night before) but I like these. They are quite small, so when I repierce it I won't have to worry about these sticking my septum. they are very cute too!"
"These are very well made but run too small, so I had to return them. Unfortunately, they do not come in a larger size that would fit my son, so I was disappointed."
I love this and would've given it 5 stars but the quality is so poor. The latch broke after one day. I will find a way to fix it because I love the look of the bracelet.
I've been using this purse for about a week now.  The strap is plenty long (I sometimes find crossbody straps aren't quite long enough to go around me comfortably) and I like the color. I almost always have all-black accessories so the red change is nice.  I like the front pocket for things you need to take in/out frequently and the main compartment is fine.  I like the option to put my mobile in the specific mobile pouch.
"It's a super cute bag, and initially I thought it would hold up. However, the zipper isn't that great. Eventually it broke (granted, it happened when I was trying to cram is shut). I was able to get it back on the track and sew off the end, so it didn't come off again. However, the teeth of the zipper don't always want to stick together. I probably won't be using it if I need to almost fill it, especially if it's with heavier items because the shoulder straps aren't that comfy. For the price, it's an okay bag."
"The concept of how the trees work is good, however the boot trees keep falling apart.  Not made well."
"The shirt was short, not long enough. The shirt also flared out instead of being closer to your body."
Pretty but sequins itchy
about 1/2 smaller
Boobs come out of the back top etc. not very good.
"If you have a tiny head or maybe no hair, I think you are good to go.  It is soft and like cashmere should be, I think would be warm for its weight.  If you have a larger head or hair upon it, save your money."
"Its small for a 3X, more like a 2.5X if you push it a bit lol. Im keeping it though, Ill fit into it shortly"
Nice but a bit smaller than I expected.
There very cool looking.
"The front is really cute. The way the fabric drapes is very flattering. The back was the problem. It was super tight back there,a bit sheer and very clingy. I returned it- and if you have any bits you don't like in your back, I would recommend ordering a size up."
"Seems like a quality material. Definitely warmer than I thought.
Thanks"
"I gave this 3 stars because although I thought it was a very attractive bra, it runs small. I normally take a 38 B and have for years. I have several other styles of Maidenform and all fit great, however this one is very tight around. Fits more like a 36 B.  Had to send it back."
Cute shirt. The velcro on the cape gets gunked up fast though.
"These are a bit small and I was going to return them, but after trying them on the second time, I realized that they will stretch. They are a decent flat for the money. I don't expect them to last longer than one season, if that."
"okay dress, it was not what I was looking for so I will return it. I'm 5'6 115 lbs and I ordered the 4/6 or small size. it was a little tight (not unbearable) the dress is very short. if you want more of a classier look (which I did) this is not the dress. Also the bottom of the dress is tighter almost like a mermaid style which is weird. I could barely move my legs"
Quality worse than expected. Did not return because was leaving on a trip the day after it arrived
"Not really the top quality I thought socks to be. My fault. The socks Im looking for are thicker in the foot area and the leg part is different. These are ok, but not really my first choice."
There is no buckle or stretch. I have a high instep and couldn't get my foot into it.
"odd fit on ch hest and shoulders. great fabric,"
"I saw RAVE reviews about this product, so I bought one, even though I didn't want to spend the money.  It is handy - it covers up an unbuttoned fly, or even an unzipped fly if you're desperate!  However, I have wide hips and (used to) have a slim waist, so it was constantly riding up and exposing what it was supposed to hide.  I have to spend all day jerking it back down.  That being said, I did use it while a little pregnant, a lot pregnant, and after the baby.  It's certainly better than a whole new wardrobe or wearing sweat pants every day."
The material is the worst in all toms shoes I have. Really disappointed.
Love the color buto for a baby who wear a size 6 and the size didn't fit they must run a little small
Cute...sexy..but uncomfortable. I used to wear a similar style when I was a dancer....they had springs in the arches...company went out of business....boo hiss...
This dress is Red and PURPLE! Not red and black like the picture shows. Also it's made out of bathing suit material. I can't wear it the way I planned but it does make for comfortable p.j's.
Necklace is not the bright yellow color in the picture but it's still a decent necklace for the price
"Would rate higher, but bought two pair and one of the slippers had a hole on the toe. I whip-stitched it closed, and am satisfied. These things happen. Nice footbed cushioning. Very comfy, very cute, nice to see them at the door at the end of a hard day."
Too small but very pretty. I messaged the seller asking for a size 12 in the brown but never heard back.
"run big, i usually wear a size 8.5/9 however these came really big for a size 9. order a size down."
Ordered 2 sizes bigger and still tight.
"Pros: If you're looking for plain, cheap, decent workout shorts, then these are perfect. They are breathable, loose-fitting, standard mesh shorts. I got four different colors, and can report that they are accurately represented in the item listing.

Cons: They are shorter than I thought they'd be, but still suffices for workout shorts. These shorts also run small, so definitely get at least one size up from what you normally wear."
I bought the wide shoe and my daughter still can't wear them well because the strap is too short.
"These ear rings probably deserve a 1 star, but they are so cheap that I wasn't expecting more. The posts are a bit jagged and hard to put though our daughter's ears sometimes. Wouldn't buy again unless I needed disposable ear rings."
"Received these bras in the post today.  The colours are very nice...the fit, not so nice.  I wear a 36C and found these bras snug where the Coobie band rests.  The cup's fit is a bit pointy at the ends and doesn't cup the breasts snugly as they should for sport bras.  I will keep them because these cons do not affect the look when they are worn under tops.
The price for these 6 sports bras is hard to beat, which is why I can accept the way they fit.  As stated earlier, despite their fit, they look fine under my garments and the snugness around the band is tolerable to bare."
"Nice dress. Good quality for the price, but is extremely small."
"I wish the Beenie was a bit larger. I would like to order more of the caps, but I don't want them fitting so snug like the Beenie. Is the knit cap larger?"
"Like that it doesn't pill (it also does pretty well with dog hair), like that it's shaped, but it runs small I wear between a L and XL, ordered an XL and it was too snug. I had my seamstress put slits in the side and it helped a little."
Like the shoe & fits good through the ball & ties but slips on my heels. Returning them.
"I love the Bali front closure sport style bra so much I bought this. The fit is a little uncomfortable, like most underwire bras. It runs big around and a little in the cup. All in all it's as good as any back hook bra."
NICE COLOR AND WEAVE.  TOO BULKY.
"Nice ring, but runs small."
I almost bought these but the same day I tried them on my mom got the exact same pair at Kohl's on clearance for less than $40.  I couldn't keep them at that point based on principle.
"a little too big for my size i chose, which is size 7. It's slightly larger than normal 7s."
not much spandex so for a shirt that runs small it won't fit
"These shoes were very cute but fit at least a full size bigger. I was very disappointed because I wanted them for school. I will have to wait until spring, and hopefully they will fit my daughter then."
These are comfortable but a bit old-fashioned looking for my taste.
ordered both ginger and black--black was at least a half a size bigger than the ginger--too bad--so cute and so comfy.  I would have liked to have both colors.
"I ordered the black, 8.5C. Searching for a shoe that offers good support and comfort has been difficult. 30 minutes after walking in these clogs at the grocery store my lower back began to severely ache, but my feet and legs were very much pain free. While these shoes felt great on my feet, it makes me have bad posture (also, my arches have fallen). I tried adjusting my posture without any success. The problem is while these shoes are very comfy to the feet they have no arch support. I will keep the shoes but can only wear them for short periods at a time."
The shoes are nice but way too small. I ordered an 11 thinking they may run a size smaller but it was more like a size 7-8
First time buying online so maybe I jut didn't know my size but it was pretty tight. My head barely fit
Cheaply made. Would b ok for a swim suite cover. I returned this item because the color was like a burnt orange and I was expecting red.
"Sadly I found this device uncomfy

It did work, just not very comfortable"
Mask smashes the face-not really manufactured logically if it is to be worn.  Weird.
Little bigger than I thought when I bought it.
"Beautiful ring, gave it to my daughter and within a week the cz fell out."
"The watch is fine for telling time.  The solar-power aspect is excellent.  Setting the day & date is cumbersome and unintuitive.  If I had it to do again, I'd just go with 'date' (day-of-the-month)."
"These felt like they would be really comfortable.  Based on other comments and reviews I ordered big, but apparently I ordered too big.  But I am returning and getting a size down and hopefully that will be perfect with room to grown (just not too much room)!"
"The shirt is very thin and has a lot of give, but it does run small. I will most likely keep this but go back to purchasing Lanmo brand it fits much better and cost is only 1.00 more."
"This is a nice deep red color and has about a one-inch heel that is fairly padded.  I needed to order wide shoes because I had foot surgery a few months earlier and the swelling has not gone away.

Even the wide width was pretty narrow.  I would say that the wide is the same as most regular width shoes.

The sandal upper is fabric and its style is very casual.

For me... did not fit well and too casual for my purposes.  This might work great for women who do not have a wide foot and are looking for a casual weekend sandal."
"These are heavy, nice sweatpants, but seem to run a little smaller than other's I have.  I wear a 10/12 and I bought the large and after washing them they seem too tight..."
"Runs small, I should ordered a size larger, returned it."
Nothing special.  You get what you pay for...and these were not pricey!
"These are nearly as comfortable as I had imagined.
They are slightly narrow in the toes for shoes sold a wide."
"First let me say I love the shoes themselves, I have a wide foot so I'm a little picky when it comes to shoes, these fit great right out of the box.  Because of my wide feet I buy men's shoes instead of women's but can never find pink!! These ASIC's fit great and the color is awesome!  If I was just using them casually this might be a 5 star review but I put a lot of miles on my shoes and at about mile 15 I noticed a sharp pain on the inside of each heel. After removing my shoes I found that there was a sharp edge on the top of insoles was curling in and slicing my feet. Luckily I had some aftermarket insoles with me, I replaced them and was good to go for the rest of the weekend.

The moral of the story... Love the shoes, hate the insoles!  My advice... Just change those suckers out and you have a 5 star shoe!"
"I tried these on and washed them and wow, they come out crazy wrinkled.  I haven't even worn them yet, as they need ironing or steaming.  So much for comfort pants, you need to do lots of work to make these look good!!  :/"
"put a pair on and thought ......these should be snug fitting not loose boxers. anyone buying these.....if the size graph tells you to buy medium , trust me , buy small."
Fits big for my nice but it's okay for play time.
Cute but tight at toes.
"Aside from them being much smaller than expected, they are some pretty good joggers. Make sure you buy up one size."
This top is very pretty but the armholes are cut too small. I will re-gift to someone it will fit
"It's not your fault, complete blame on me for ordering the wrong size, or not knowing how to put one of these things on."
Another product that has to be layered. If that's what you want then this is the product for you. I haven't figured out how to get some of the factory wrinkles out of it. Washing and drying hasn't worked so far.
not exactly how is in picture. the top is not metallic its knitted pink and it was a bit big
Had to send back because didn't fit right. a litter snug. It's a nice dress and I wish it had fit
"These are cute, but I ordered the smallest size and there is no way my baby will be able to wear them this winter. Might fit when she is two years old, but these won't work for an infant. However, if you don't need them small they are very warm and easy to put on it seems. Decent quality for the price."
"It was a good size and quality, but I ended up returning it since it didn't expand the way I expected it to"
"I'm keeping them b/c I didn't return them right away.  Yes, the foot bed is like a yoga mat.  It's also completely flat like a yoga mat and I don't think I'm doing my feet any favors by wearing these."
"The ankle support is really good.  The issue is below the ankle.  The shoe wears loose at the heal and the soul is very stiff, so it feels like your heal isn't on the soul of the shoe.  The disclaimer to this is that it is still a new shoe, so it isn't broken in yet.  The sold and heal of the shoe may soften up and allow for the shoe to fit more snugly at the base of the foot.  Time will tell."
"Not sure what I expected, but the top would not stay up - it would roll down ... I am not that portly so I was somewhat disappointed."
It's not a strong pants. Mine lasted 6 months.
I love SANUK and the product and quality they are but I own a few pairs and 2 of them are the same style; just different color. The psi I just recieved is a lot right her than the precious one purchased but I still wear them
"I got this fast, I think one or two days after I ordered it.  It is a costume, so it isn't up to everyday wear quality.  I had to iron it, and the hoop did bend weird.  The hoop problem was fixed when I by accident broke the hoop.  After that the circle was a little smaller, but it lay perfectly.

As far as size, I'm 5'2 and a size 4-6.  It fit me perfectly.  If you have a lot up top, or if you're tall, this costume probably won't fit."
"Good price, but uncomfortably tight on all but my skinniest of days.
I don't think a size up would have been proportioned correctly."
"These run quite large, I must wear socks to keep them on.  Also they come too high up on the top of my foot."
was a nice looking shoe
Fits great unless you have a smaller breasts. In that case it makes them appear flat. It's a nice color and the materials nice.
"This is definitely for kids who only carry a dollar or two around lol.
Very small for a wallet on the inside. My boyfriend has it as a decoration on his dresser. Another friend used theirs for a while and fins face is gone lol. It got so stretched out too and looks deformed now."
"For me, I like this suit.  Love the shorts under but the bustline in this one seems to run a little smaller
for the size I ordered.  Cute and maybe if I tighten the straps some, it'll fit better.  Great suit for an older gal."
They fit when first put on but after walking around with shoes they start to slide down making them uncomfortable. Disappointed
"Photo looks great, but bag sags after initial usage."
"Style is really cute; color is good. I am normally a size 6-1/2 M. Sometimes if a shoe runs small, I'll take a 7. I ordered a 6-1/2. The width was okay. but I wouldn't want it any wider. Problem is with the length of the foot bed. It seemed more like a size 6. Funny thing, though, my left heel (only) keeps slipping out when I walk. Unfortunately, it has to go back."
"I wanted to like these so badly! I have another pair of Ahnu shoes that fit well and are very comfortable (but stink to high heaven) so I was hopeful these would work for me on a trip I have coming up where I anticipate a lot of walking. The look is really cute, a great cross between a ballerina flat and a sneaker, and the color (cranberry) is really fun. Unfortunately, I had heel pain when just standing in my kitchen, hardly even walking at all! I know the insoles are removable, but I have neither the time nor inclination to now have to track down the perfect insole to make these comfortable, especially after the money I paid for these. Ahnu makes quality shoes, which I don't mind paying for, but they should be comfortable straight out of the box. I was sorry to send these back."
"I was looking for dark brown low heeled boots to wear to work.  these are ok, but i would rather have them fit more snug at the ankle as i feel them move a little when i walk.  even thicker socks don't fill that gap.  if you have bigger ankles these will work great."
"Beautiful watch, the size is perfect, easy to note the time at a glance and the stopwatch feature (which I use constantly) is also easily viewed.  The reason I gave it only three stars is the size of the date window.  This is a large faced watch (45 mm) and all functions are easy to see at a glance, except for the date window.  The date window is totally out of proportion with the rest of the watch and nearly unreadable.  This makes no sense as there is plenty of room on the watch face for a larger date window.  A fix is needed here.  Otherwise I'm very satisfied."
I returned this shoe because they didn't fit right for me.  My heel came to the right spot but my toes felt cramped.
Bought a bunch of asics wide (4e) over the years. These are not as wide. Sneaker seems fine though.
"Did not really want a bra with ""filling"", but wanted a smooth look. This bra comes very high under the arm. Instead of making this bra so high in the underarm, they would do well to put some side stays instead."
this shoes looks very nice with jeans. I made the mistake of buying a 1/2 size bigger without thinking that they are true size. I still love them.
not as comfortable as I expected it to be. I have heel pain and the CROCS sandals that I use does not put pressure on my heel so I thought this flip flops would be the same way. I thought wrong! 30 minutes into wearing it and I was ready to take it off!
"The bra came on the date that was set. It's a pretty bra, but I think they sacrificed some comfort for aesthetic appeal. I don't recommend this bra to those with sensitive skin, it can get itchy.

Overall, I'm happy with this bra. It's a great fit."
"It's cute on the picture, but it's quality is poor."
"I wasn't that happy with these ""Boots"". although, I am wearing them.  They fit, feel and behave more like high top shoes.  I had to purchase Arch supports to make them feel more comfortable.  Do not wear thick socks, as they will cramp your feet."
Light weight material and cheap waist band but a good fit.
Fits really tight
The stone is different than the picture
Way too big. However they are soft but fit way over my belly button.
"The sizing is odd. I'm XS and got a Small, but then I read again and it's because the size says it's XS/S. I would say is not an XS but an S, so it looks somewhat large on me. Anyway, I'm not returning it."
Gloves are so little!!
"I wish this suit would have worked out for me. I am 123lbs 5'2"" and a 32Ddd chest and I ordered a medium. I really liked the way it fit my bottom. The suit was a little loose around my stomach and there is absolutely no chest support which I need after having 3 kids. If your chest is perkier then mine it may workout for you. I ended up having to return it."
I was hoping for a casual look. But these pants (material & color)  look more like work pants. I do like the pockets.
"I thought that since these were ""Riggs by Wrangler"", they would fit like a pair of Wranglers.  They don't.  For me, the cut of these pants were just uncomfortable and the waist was to small.  I think the material would have been great, but I couldn't get past how they fit me, so I returned them."
It is a beautiful swimsuit but the material is not so good. It is transparent when you are in the water.
gave it to my son
Fit a little small. I wear an 8-10 depending on brand. I ordered a 10 and they fit but any smaller and they would have been too tight! They make a swishing sound when they move which makes them seem cheap. I only paid $12 for these so I would say they are worth the price but I wouldnt buy more for the same price.
Not real happy the fit is way to big and the color is way to royal in my opinion. I do plan on ordering more t-shirts only not in this color or size.
"It is comfortable, easy for walking.  The only issue is... you have to wear long socks because the edge of the boots will rub your skin."
This is a very big size 4 sandals. It fits like an adult size 6 so if you have small feet be careful. I would say apart form that it is a cute sandal
Slippers looked good and fit well. My only problem was a tag attacked to the inside of the slipper between the arch and the heel.  The tag constantly rubbed the bottom of my foot making the slipper uncomfortable to wear.  The tag was so securely attached that it was extremely difficult to remove.  I did finally remove the tag which left a small tare in the liner.
"I bought this for a ring master halloween costume. I followed the sizing chart and got the 5XL, but it was way too big. For reference, I am 5' 3"", 170lbs, 40"" waist, and typically buy XL shirts. On its tightest lacing, it was still too big for me. I sent it back and went with 3XL so I could have a slight gap in back and still get that hourglass look."
Good shoes. Decent quality and comfortable. Especially for the price.
needed a siz3 12 instead of a 10 for a 144pd weight
Not too comfortable. Hope to break them in.
love the Jambu's but they all seem to fit a bit differently.  This one is too wide for my foot.  Must wear socks with them.
"Not a bad shoe, wanted something with a little higher heal.  Rather that an everyday shoe, I was looking for a dress/evening shoe.  This shoe looked like it would work base of pic, but when I got it home and tried it on, was not what I had hoped."
"Love the shoe, but ordered up a half size due to heel, dress pump, etc. Usually wear 9.5 t- he 10 in Vnce Camuto runs vety tight in the toe- ball of foot. Had to send back. Pretty color, broke my heart!"
"the bridge of the tongue, which presses against one's shin is fairly hard leather and chafes a bit. Teh workman ship is superb, although the fit is smaller than i expected."
"The way the point is in the front of the shoe, really turned me off. Other than than that it's a nice shoe. Nice fabric, appears durable. Nice height, just to much of a narrow point in the front"
"I have higher quality nato straps. This one is definitely synthetic leather and feels lesser quality but for $6.99 price I got on this, it was a decent deal."
"For a very small wrist. It's cute.
The price was 12$ and that's what you get."
"Undershirt is needed while wearing!  this very beautiful very flowing, & Very see through"
"the boots arrived quickly, they had a very heavy odor but that went away fast, one shoe feels a bit wider than the other but over all the boot is comfortable and I was glad I had them for my winter event."
odd memory foam support... i like the rubber sole Crocs inserts better
"If I purchased a large, this would be one of my favorite shirts, and since they're so inexpensive, I'll probably just buy another one in a large. Normally I wear a medium. At some stores like cold water creek or old navy, I wear a small. This, my friends is not a roomy garment for American ladies. Just buy a size up from what you normally get and you'll be thrilled with it! Super, super soft, wash, dry and wear. It's great for jeans, leggings or a maxi skirt. So comfortable you'll want to wear it for pajamas! They run really long and could almost be a dress if you would wear it short."
I'd rather have it altered that to send it back.
Looks nice until you get close.  The lining is only what you see in the picture; it is not fully lined and the fabric is very thin.
"LOVE this top, but it doesn't hold up well because of the fabric. It's nice fabric but stretches easily. I've hand washed it once and stretched out so I wouldn't dare throwing this in the washer machine. As a mom of 2 under 3, I can't really wear ""hand wash items"" but it was worth the 11 dollars. Just be careful! It kind of drapes the body, so if you're looking to hide bulge I don't think this will work well."
Snagged the first time she wore them. Very pilted after washing.
"I brought the boot and they are comfortable. I can walk all day in these, but a few days later the boot began to split up the middle. The top seam just began to pop. The boots are not tight, so I was surprised.  I guess that's what you get for this price."
"I like the fact that these slippers are boiled wool - which are the best kind - and that you can wear them outside because of the solid tennis shoe-like soles.  BUT, because the interior is like a tennis shoe, the slippers feel kind of clammy and cold - so not so cozy."
Xmas gift!
not so much large but a little wide
Very cone shaped. I'm not a fan
"The material is a bit lighter weight than I expected, even being labeled light weight. Which means it doesn't quite hang as shown in the photo. I purchased burgundy, and it's lighter in color (a bit more pink) than the photo shows."
"The fabric is just OK. I'm as disappointed with the fit of this shirt as I am with almost everything I buy these days. It seems that ladies clothing is being made for giraffes with very, very long arms. I'm a typical shape for someone of my age (over 65). I'm not especially tall: my hands don't reach my knees with my arms by my sides and I don't like shirts that reach my lower thigh. So I'll wear this one around the house. Maybe I'll try to shrink it. Maybe I have to stop buying clothes on the Internet."
"Runs small...ordered for both of my daughters and fit well up to size 7 juniors...so 1 is going back!
It is cute. Nothing great needs a belt to cover the waist band that is small and a bit odd, but it will be cute worn with a jacket or sweater and just a cute tee to dress it down."
"It looked very cheap, and ran very small!  I ordered a XXL and it fit like an XSmall!"
its kind of small... It would have been great to have more size options.
"This is OK, but not sure it is real leather.  I think it is fake."
"This is a very cute shirt, but runs VERY small. Order a size or 2 larger than what you usually wear. It is a thin t-shirt material, but is not see-through."
"just the sizing was wrong. the pink pair i ordered a size larger and fits perfect. again, i cannot return due to Amazon says ""return window has closed"". It sucks being disabled with Lyme disease, in/out of hospital so i am not always home to return within 'store' guidelines! and online is the only way i can shop!  Disappointed in amazon for not being more flexible for certain circumstances....."
the back of the dress is quite low so you will not be able to use a bra with it. Also the fabric is quite see through so use color appropriate underwear!
Like these much.  I have been wearing them for years. They also have pockets instead of a piece of cloth sewed onto the outside.  I also like the adjustable fit since I am a big guy plus there is enough material in the crotch to keep from restricting things.  I previously rated these much higher but that was based on prior purchases.  They now fit just like wranglers-too short in the body so if you have purchased these a couple years ago-order a size bigger.
"My toddler and I love Livie and Luca shoes.... except these.  They are super cute, but the leather is very very stiff - not like the usual soft leather found in this brand's Ruche or Juno shoes.  Disappointed."
Great shades for the price.
"Cant wear heavy socks with them, but if you wear a thin dress sock you can wear them most of the day
Shame their a little tight because they appear to be made well"
Cute shoes but i could take the narrow shoes and I ordered an wide
"This fit as expected - I am 5'5"" and it just grazed the floor. I just didn't like the look on me. I am very curvy and it made me look 2x bigger."
Really cute but had to return them  :(
"Beautiful ring, great detail and awesome price.  But my stone fell out after only wearing it for about 1 month.  I didn't notice it fell out so I wasn't able to find it and try to glue it back in."
"Cute paints, but pretty flimsy. It would be nicer if the fringe actually was real and not just part of the print. They are comfortable though and I am glad to have purchased them."
"So I read all of the reviews that said this vest was too big, it is too small and really boxy looking"
Pretty normal flannel pajama bottoms. They developed a ripped seam after one wearing which is why I only gave them 3 stars. Mended them and hope they last a while longer.
I love the bag but it's very heavy.
i purchased this dress in 2 sizes for my girls who were flower girls. The M (9 month) is so scratchy the baby was so uncomfortable all night and the dress kept riding up on her. The 2t dress (worn by my 3 1/2 year old) was slightly big on her but it looked beautiful. It does not ride up in this size and it was very pretty. She loves the dress and wears it once a week (or more) now that the wedding is over she's always the best dressed at pre-school.
"The ends came off and were lost at school the first day he wore them.
I do like that my kindergartner doesn't have untied shoelaces everyday, but these  didn't work well with Orthotics because you cannot open the shoes wide enough."
"I really liked this wallet at first but after using it for just a couple of months the leather portion along the top of the card pockets has become somewhat loose. Also, the material for the card slot lining is a kind fabric that doesn't hold it's shape well resulting in the cards not being very secure. I think the slots could have more of height difference as well, it can be difficult removing a card from a rear slot without having to put your entire finger between the pocket to get a grip on it."
It's a very nice scarf but not as soft or luxurious as I expected for the money.
The photos looks better then the product recieved. It is somewhat small and the color is different. It will do fine for Halloween.
ok .. A LITTLE TIGHTER AROUND THE WASTE THAN EXPECTED ..
You get what you pay for
The smaller white stones have started to fall off after just a month of wearing the ring.
Fits small.  If you are large buy an extra large.
I wish I would have spent a little more for a better pair.
"Material feels well made and has a bit of stretch.  I was very disappointed it didn't fit.  I ordered a 6P which is the smallest size offered.  I have an odd shape (big butt small waist) and was hoping the elastic waist would help the gap in the back I get with normal jeans.  The 6p in the size chart was marked for 36 in hip and 25.5 in waist.  I have a 36 in hip and 24.5 in waist and i was drowning in them.  It felt 1 or 2 sizes too large.  I will get a label to return them tomorrow.  I don't know if it is a vanity size thing or if I just got mismarked pants.  They came quickly and look nice and well made, just didn't fit."
"The material for this is NOT cotton as listed I. The description. It is a shiny polyester blend. The color is as it appears & the fit was true to size. Other than the fabric, it is okay."
tends to roll up. picture does not represent how the item looks on
I prefer panty lines to ride ups. These tends to not stay in place but absolutely no panty lines
"The color is much darker than the photo and has a greenish, greyish tone to it. I don't mind the color, but I bought this for hiking and was hoping to have a brighter color so that I could be easily spotted in case I need help. The darker blue with the greenish, greyish tone makes me blend right in with the wilderness.

It's thicker than I hoped, but that would make sense with the tight weave that is necessary for true sun protection. It's fairly breathable. I was in the heat, but not overheated while wearing it. The heavier weight was not ideal for me and that was the uncomfortable part."
"I have a lot of expectations for Stila products and this was just ""m'eh"". I liked the tip, but it doesn't moisten easily and it grabs the skin. I use basic inkwell stuff that are easier to apply."
very nice and wonderful but very narrow even size 2d
"Not as long as picture appears, barely at hip level. Fabric is thin, as expected for the price."
Not exactly what I expected Gave it to my daughter who liked it and looked very nice wearing it.
"I read all the reviews and went for it anyway.  Like others said, it was a specific band and cup size (34D) but it happened to be a size that fit me well enough.  I never buy non-underwire bras, especially not for working out, but this really does its job.  I do have to complain though, that the zipper really doesn't stick at the top.  Most of the time, there is just a little gap.  But once I was working out, and it totally unzipped on me.  I will definitely still use it, even with 3 stars it is still my favorite sports bra (goes to show you how bad some others are, but it isn't perfect.  Oh, and I bought a front close to make nursing my son easier, and it is okay for that.  I was hoping to not have to unzip it all the way, but the zipper pops open and everything pops out, so it's really not much different than pulling up a back close bra."
"Love the fabric. I probably should have ordered a size smaller. They are as advertised - verrrry stretchy. They are also very high waisted - maybe too high waisted...especially since I have to keep pulling them up. I love the length. Ordered grey and black. The grey ones came with a hole/tear in the seam on the leg. Overall, I am happy with the purchase."
"Just did a test run so far but it seems a little loose.  I was looking for something tight fitting for winter cycling.  However, for the price it will suffice and I'm pretty confident keep me warm where I need it to."
Way too big. Returned. Didn't like the product.
The shoes are comfortable but they are really too large.  I regret not sizing down.  The shoe is made very well and I like the rocker bottom.  I would definitely suggest sizing down.
Nice dress but the size is somewhat small.
Moderately uncomfortable
Color was VERY dark and the snake skin looked as though it was printed on.  I returned it.
"What this product lacks in it's zipper design it makes up for in versatility and cuteness.  If I had to purchase again, I'd be on the fence for something less cute but much easier to zip/unzip.  You always have to leave room to sip up so you can zip down to take the coat off.  It also almost takes me 2-3 tries to get the zipper started to unzip.  I love that you can switch sides to have a water/wind repellent outside or a cute fuzzy side.  It fits great and look cute."
"I love the bag, but after one use it started to tear in the corner."
It is pretty and well made. I liked the style because this is what we wore in my teens and 20s. It has a lot of spandex. Even at the tightest hooks and having selected a size too small I have problems with it riding down. For play it is OK. For day wear it is iffy. Unless you get off on pulling your nylons and garter up in public.
"I am 24 weeks pregnant and my boobs won't stop growing. I have grown attached to a Champion sports bra, but thought a new addition would be nice. There is not enough support to wear this out of the house, but is very comfortable to wear at home and give the girls a little support while still letting them breath."
Somewhat small. Can't move much!
"Was a wrap style ring, not a solid but still a good ring.  Would suggest a better description."
Quality is great. Dont forget to be in a good shape - you will appear as is.
"Fit exactly how I wanted for the athletic cut.  My quads and calves are very muscular so it's hard to find jeans that are comfy.  These are.  The reason I'm only giving 3 stars is after one wash, the inside lining broke off.  I love the ripped fray look, but I was slightly disappointed after one wash."
"I loved the punchy, coral color of this shoe.  I loved the cutouts.  I loved the design.  I hated that the minute I put these on my feet, I knew that they would give horrifying blisters and would take forever to break in to the point of relative comfort.  It killed me, but back they went."
"I ordered these shoes in navy, when I got them the box said navy but the shoes were definitely black.  I assume they sent me the wrong color but the shoes themselves did not say what color they were.  I didn't need black and they were a little small. I returned them but I did like the shoe.  I would order a size up, but if these had been the right color I would have kept them.  I didn't exchange them because I was unsure about the navy color."
"I'm a true 8.5, ordered a 9 and it fit pretty snug. The material is nice, the height is great on my 5'9 frame, and the fit is comfortable. The reason I returned is the look. The ankles were a little too large for my taste and they scrunched up a lot with every step I took."
"LOVE/HATE relationship with these socks.
Love the way it looks and it was ""breathable"" because they do feel thin for sure. Love that it's perfect for my VANS slip-ons.
Hate that my big toe already ripped through a new pair on the first day, when my toenails are trimmed and proper (I have great hygiene).
I gave it 3 stars for that reason... if it was durable, I would give it 5 stars... Don't expect these to last long."
"the large is a bit puffy in the middle, would be more flattering if it was sewn in a bit at the waist, otherwise, it's fine, cute, whimsical and comfortable."
"For the watch itself I would have given four or five stars.  I like the style of it and am fussy about having an analog watch with a light.  However, I was unable to complete the instructions regarding sizing the strap.  In the end I paid a local jeweler to do it - he had a little difficulty, too."
"Body too small but sleeve, collar were correct size."
"Ok, fabric is thin but some may want that."
"Because I thought this was a women's hoodie I ordered a large and it was way too big.  When I contacted Amazon they made a call and found that this hoodie is not available in women's sizes and that the confusion was caused by a misprint. As you can see, the mistake has yet to be corrected, so beware.  The main reason I'm writing a review is to talk about the hood.  When up, the hood raises the shoulders which causes pressure on one's head, making it very uncomfortable.  Im not sure that's clear.  In other words, when one puts up the hood there's more than an inch gap between your own shoulder and that of the hoodie.  There probably wasn't enough material allowed for the hood, making it much too tight vertically.  I hope that's clear.  Otherwise, it's a nice shirt, good weight."
"I love the idea of this top, however, it barely holds the girls...so no support, and it doesn't cover the girls up completely, because of the lack of support, you'll find your boobs going down under the bust area."
A 3 rating only because my size ordered is too large. I would suggest to go down a size or two. Otherwise the material is really nice.
Calf fits but the footing is one size to big. Im hoping with some shoe inserts or foot padding sock insert they will fit better other wise not sure I like them.
Nice wallet. It does ripped easily and fades quickly too.
"Super cute, but not as thick as I'd hoped. Also, I don't have big calves, but they seemed pretty tight. I DO own WW socks now though!"
"Ordered a 12 in case too small.  It fits like a snug 10.  Nice looking dress, but very heavy material.  Needed as a bridesmaid dress for upcoming wedding."
The shoes are a little long - but I like the memory foam base. I wanted a shoe that can slip on and off easily and these fit the bill.
Had to return these shoes as they were too small. My spouse does have  very wide feet so i wasn't surprised. Otherwise we liked them. I returned the shoes approx. 10 days ago looking forward to a credit.
They run a bit small so they slip off my heal. I wear a 7/7.5
I bought the incorrect size-thinking a XL would be best but have ordered a large to get something a little smaller.
"The pointelle design make it nice to wear to sleep or as a layering piece. Loose fit and unstructured light weave fabic not really suitable to wear alone, at least not in the off white color. Icebreaker has a good line of structured merino wool camis that I prefer."
"They were too large and the size 8 was too small , it seems to me that they are not made the same as they used to be very sad because I love the old ones I have and need new ones  , maybe will try 8 when they are in stock and try to stretch them"
"I loved the comfort and the feel of these boots - however after a month of wearing, the top part of it started slacking and slumping down and didn't look that great. It was very wide and loose. Returned."
"My friend she likes it, for some reason it runs a size smaller than ordered, would recommend to order one sz bigger, other than that its ok."
"These are a little bit small, but i have just been squeezing in to them because i love the way they feel and look."
I typically like the Very Fine shoes.  These are a little larger than the same size in another style.
"It wasn't until after a bit of observation that I realized that I had not received the swimsuit pictured. Though I will not post my own photos, you can see from other review photos that, while the design is extremely similar, it is not exact. I was quite disappointed when I had realized so.

However, I still do quite like the swimsuit. Like I said, they are very similar designs and it fit nice, though a bit tight around my hips. Make sure to follow the size chart, you'll most likely order 2 sizes bigger than what you're used to, but measure yourself just to check.

The material is comfortable, I had a bit of difficulty situating my breasts (D cup) at first but eventually I managed. The cups in the fabric are removable, though I've chosen to keep mine in. As for the underwire, it was a bit awkward and taking it out would be difficult, though I'm keeping that in as well.

I did in face make me look slimmer, though I had to frequently tug the fabric covering my stomach down because it would bunch at the top.

I haven't worn it into water yet, but so far, the purchase seemed neither disappointing nor thrilling. I'm fine with it."
"The clipper, nail file, and tweezers are a nice stainless steel. The slanted tweezers work well.  They grasp the hair and pull it from the root instead of just breaking it.  The nail file is wonderful.  One side is coarse and the other side is fine.  Both sides work extremely well to shape and seal nails.

The nail clipper, on the other hand, is a bit flimsy and hard to open.  It's also made of stainless steel, but it's so thin that its difficult to cut your nails. Unfortunately, the design is great but it falls short on functionality.  I find that it slips out of place.  I have long nails and I bent one of them when the nail clipper slipped out of position.  I won't be using it again.  I'll stick with my Trim nail clipper.

I wouldn't recommend this manicure set, unless you have very thin and fragile nails, especially at the current price of $99."
Looks some what cheep.
kind of strange cut... hangs kind of weird but I can work with it
"I like the quality of the garment, but it was much too big for my 12 month old."
"Lovely color and style, and although long enough, the vamp is too narrow. I gave the shoe three stars instead of two because the leather is soft and can be stretched a bit to fit. I have purchased a number of Seychelles shoes and sandals and this is the first time I have run into a problem with the fit."
"Very long! If you want capris and are petite these are not the pjs for you!  I'm 5'2"" and these are like pants on me. They are very soft though, and I love the pockets and drawstring, so I think I'll try to hem them myself."
"The fabric is smooth. However, the size was too small. If I need to purchase this item in the future, I will buy a bigger size."
"Love carters shoes cause they go with everything, especially if you shop the clothing at carters. The only thing I don't like is that they are not that durable so this is not a shoe to have the child play outside it. Wears very easily. Actually return them cause the front toe started peeling after not much activity."
"I am 5'2"", bra size 32D, pants size small, 2 to 4. The top actually fits well, the bottoms fit ok but I would have preferred them to be less fitted. I did wash them and still fit the same. They did wrinkle quite a bit after drying even though I removed them immediately when the cycle ended, despite using fabric softener and drying sheet."
"I like them, they are sporty, but the shoe cuts in slightly to run up against the big toe. If your foot geometry is like mine with a straight foot (no bunions or inward-turning toes) you'll feel the same thing. I can't wear the new Nikes for this same reason. It's not a total loss for the shoe (it looks really good), but not sure if I'd want to run the risk of blisters to do hard core training in them."
"Nice boot, but it is a little narrow on my foot, so I am hoping being leather it will stretch out and form better to my foot once they get worn in.  My first pair which were the same size fit great, and were very comfortable.  Although I like the boot, I think next time around I would look for a boot with a softer leather, and a little wider."
"The dress looks pretty but it has one flaw-fitting around shoulder is not good. The dress stoops out at the back, needs repeated adjusting. I wear it with a jacket. That helps."
"Stiff fabric, not really comfortable.  Didn't get much softer after several washes."
I don't like the way it looks on me.
"These are cute, but very tiny!"
I normally wear a smaller cup size but ordered up. Too small in cup area - bra is okay for causal wear but not for formal wear.
"I found this dress to fit very well other than being too long. I am 5 ft 3. There is no way i could wear it without shortening the length.
White color is semi-see through but nothing that some nude shapewear can't fix."
For some reason this sleep shirt ( cats pajamas) was much more snug fitting than the other two I bought: Pawsetively Tired and One night stand. Seems there is an inconsistency in fit.
it is much stiffer than other ecco shoes i have these are made in china and not the same grade of material
"If you have a long torso, this is not the right size. I'm a 38"" bust and 33"" waist, 65 1/2"" torso. I originally ordered the XXL and it was too big in the bust and the waist was as tight as it could go. The waist was comfortable, but I wish I could have been able to tightened it more. The length was perfect.
I ordered the XL instead and it's too short. It did fit everywhere else, but in the length.
My friend had the L. The L and XL are pretty much the same length. The XXL is 1 1/2 inches longer all around, than the XL or L.
XL measures 10 1/2"" on the side from center of bust, but under arm and down. 15"" from the just over the nipple and down. On me, this came down just to the top of my hip and my hip stuck out. It wasn't pretty. This was for a costume, so I kept the XXL and had the bust taken in as best I could. If this was for fashion, unfortunately neither would have worked for me.  It is a very pretty corset. If you can find the right fit, it will look beautiful."
"The bathing suit is really cute but I don't like the zipper. I bought one similar set in Oshkosh Bgosh and I should have bought two sets instead of one. The previous one I bought doesn't have a zipper. I think it's better for little ones to have bathing suits without a zipper on the back. In case, they get hurt when they fall. I think the designer didn't really think about this. And the little that is pretty cute but not easy to keep it on with her hair tied up. Overall, the bathing suit is pretty nice!"
A bit too large to fit in inside pocket of purse while holding readers.  Otherwise fine.
"The shirt is better looking in the picture.  However, the material is very nice.  I have other SSLR shirts, the one with the anchors, in various colors, and it has a different texture to it.  They are all very nice, however, the texture is a little thicker on this shirt.  The shirt looks very pretty in the picture, however the colors are brighter, and perhaps a little too loud for my liking.  Again, the quality is very nice, the colors, pattern just a little louder than what you see in the picture."
"These shoes have a comfortable footbed with memory foam that provides all day comfort. The front straps are non-adjustable and are designed for a wide foot. Since I have a wide foot I was pleased but they would be too loose for narrow feet. I wish they had been made adjustable.  It's great for people who stand on their feet all day but I wouldn't recommend them for a lot of walking as the front straps can loosen up after a while and the foot slides a little which can get really uncomfortable on long walks.

The ankle strap has a velcro but my feet swell during summer at the ankles or after long periods of sitting and the strap is too short, or rather the velcro does not come up far enough so I can seal the strap when my ankles swell. This renders them useless to me. Since I got them on a good Amazon deal, rather than return them I am going to stick some more Velcro on them. I just have to find the right color so it does not look bad.
Update: see pic I found sticky Velcro dots (for fabrics) at JoAnn in a similar color and stuck them on so the strap can be looser and fit. The Velcro dots are available on Amazon too, but at a higher price.

There is not much arch support on these sandals, but it's seldom that you can find any with good arch support. At least it provides memory foam comfort to my feet so they don't get all rough and chapped.

I will be using these as my work sandals in the summer as the nuetral color coordinates well with many outfits and makes them look less casual."
"Ankle was loose which is a bummer because they were super cute otherwise. If you're expecting these to be form fitting around your ankle, you're in for some bad news. The zipper was INCREDIBLY stiff, and there is a stitch that stops it about halfway down, which is a bummer, but that's how big the entire pocket is."
"Fits appropriately and doesn't look too bad with casual clothes, but really loose around the ankles. The real problem is the pain my toes were in 10 minutes after walking due to tightness. They feel tightly squeezed after only an hour of standing. Will have to stretch the front area to make comfy and spacious especially for thick socks."
I normally wear a 7.5-8 size in womens. These shoes are HUGE. I ordered a 7. Way too big. Easy to exchange to correct size. Will update after I find an approriate size.
These don't take long to provide a relax fit
Dose not look like the picture
"A bit too small, be careful putting them on so you don't snag them."
"These are beautiful boots, soft leather and a wonderful color.  However, they were somewhat small across the toe area on the right foot.  If they had fit with socks on, they might have stretched; but I did not want to take that chance.  So, I returned them.  (so sad!)"
"A good-looking high quality shoe. The length is fine, however the toe box on this new pair is much narrower than that of my comfy older VANELi loafers that I've greatly enjoyed and had high hopes of replacing with similar kind. Regrettably, I cannot wear the new loafers and had to return them."
I ended up returning this dress because the material is very thin and stretchy. I was expecting something a little denser.
"i ordered the 8W - i usually buy 8.5, but i needed the extra width.  i did not feel any extra width with the W, and the shoes were longer than the 8M.  i'm keeping them because they are so cute, but disappointed with craftmanship on that aspect."
Nice coat but thin and for someone who is very fit and thin.
Beautiful dress but very thin. I like the pattern on this dress so its a keeper
"I ordered it in cobalt color, it wasn't as bright as pictured.  Quality was also not as good, thread was hanging in one place and it felt like ripping apart when I tried to put these leggings on.  I ordered it because I have Lysse Leggings Denim Control Capri 1615 and Lysse Leggings for Women-The New Cotton Skinny Legging (Style #1202) that I like and I was looking for the same in another color.  These are not the same quality, or maybe I got an imitation.... There was no issue with returning through Amazon though."
"This wallet lasted about 3 or 4 months, then the inside liner separated from the rest of the wallet somehow. Also, most of the credit card slots are too small. The magnetic fastener is coming out of the flap, and I have to be really careful with it, or it will be gone forever. It's not bad for the price, but I will be replacing it within a year of my purchase because the quality is not such that it will hold up to regular wear for a long period of time. I do like the owl design. It's cute."
i love them . they are really pretty. butt take sooo long .to get them tho.
The material of the polo wasn't very good.
thought it would be bigger
"Unfortunately, these didn't work for me and I ended up just getting a strapless bra instead.  I felt that they pulled weird on the straps causing them to not lay flat."
Color has faded a lot. seems to be wearing thin quickly
"The skirt itself is very cute. However, I the skirt is to big and does not lie the way it looks on the model. The skirt has way too much material and looks clunky. I decided to keep it anyway because I figured returning it would be a hassle and the skirt is still cute so I plan to tailor it a bit."
not particularly impressed with boot. boot appears to be well constructed but the materials seem a little cheap.
Not as comfortable as I expected. They black ones fit smaller than the multi - color ones I purchased. Can only wear them a few hours - disappointed.
These shoes were not as comfortable as most shoes from clarks
It is what I expected for the price.  I just needed something for a short trip where it would be  30-40 and I am used to 90 all the the
"Very loose, but its okay."
Don't buy it if you have small tata's!!!!!!!!!!  Makes me want a boobjob though because it's SOO cute!
Nice for the price but very short!
I like the style and number of pockets with these scrubs. Even the material is nice but the quality leaves something to be desired. I have 3 pairs (all from different stores) of scrub pants in this style and every one came either with stitching already coming loose or the stitching came loose/separated by the second wash. For the price I feel that the quality is poor but the design helps to offset my frustrations some.
"like some of the other reviewers, I have worn Carhartt workshirts for years. The old ones were 5.5 ounce cotton. The new ones are much lighter, 4.5 ounce. They don't wear or wash the same. I wish Carhartt would get out of China and go back to quality."
Thought it would be sturdier.
The price is good but the color was really off. I received a dark Navy instead of the color on the listing.
"thought it would be a sexy style dress, defiantly not. very long"
"and inexpensive. Not good for slippery surfaces, but does provide some coverage against water/liquids; air holes in the sides of the shoes allow water/moisture in. I did have to purchase arch supportive shoe inserts. Overall, a decent shoe depending on the need."
The clips snap more often than not. Not bad but not the best.
"I ordered the biggest size they had. It fits, but a little snug. I love the fabric, cool and stretchy."
I have been wearing this particular shoe for years so I can't figure out why this pair was tight.  I think it might have been mismarked.
They only problem I have is that the credit cards are in there so tight it's hard to get them out
"I bought these as a gift and I have to say that they seemed perfect. However, after only two weeks the polarized lens appears to be pealing :/ they've been kept in the case when not being worn."
"There were no pockets in bag more like a shopping bag, also I went to Ross department store
locally and found the same make, colour and better styles for ten dollars cheaper.
I did not like paying 8 dollars for shipping either.  I ended up giving item away."
I ordered from another company after wearing this one a couple of times.  It feels 'thin'  and has a tendency to roll down.
"I took the advice of some other customers and purchased the medium as I am a size large. The fit is extremely tight. It does suck it in well, but is so difficult to put on. I am going to wait on wearing it until I have lost a few lbs. Otherwise it is as stated..a great waist trainer. Also it is very stiff and not for use during exercise. Driving was a bit uncomfortable but nothing major."
"These are really cute, but run large. I wear a 7-7.5, bought a 7, couldve worn a 6 or 6.5. Theres a big gap at the back. Didnt feel like exchanging, will wear anyway."
"These are cute but they don't last. My older kiddo wore them for one not-very-rainy season (certainly not every day!) and they had already started cracking. When my little one got them as a hand-me-down, they lasted just a few wears before they had cracks throughout, especially where the boot bends while walking."
"While I like this tshirt now, it took a bit of effort. I don't know if it was too much starch in the material, but this shirt was very odd-feeling, bordering on scratchy, when I received it. Took quite a bit of soaking in a salt/vinegar/baking soda solution, then washing it and drying it to get the material even close to being soft."
"the final QC/QA department needs to check the size of the product before they ""stamp/silkscreen"" the ""size"" on the item. Received (3) items but one was obviously small in size but marked XL"
one size fits all I wear size 7 and they were too small
"The quality is fine.  And maybe it's me, but they took up more room than just packing the whole bag.  I'm not sure I will use them as intended again.  I think i'll store linens and items in my closet."
I normally wear an 8-10 standard size and bought an 11 and they were snug. I'd suggest going a size or two up.
Looked great. Felt soft. Too small.
Bronze/gold version the studs are pretty gaudy. Not recommended. Maybe another color is better.
"I had never had these types of ear muffs before so was worried they would not stay on.  They do work, but after a long period of time they can start making your ears sore from the pressure of the metal that holds them on your ears."
turned out to be too large for my bag.  takes up more space than the other two cases together.  Maybe I'll get a new bag because it certainly is efficient as a glasses holder.
after reading all reviews I bought these a size larger thay are a little snug thay have lasted for six months now thay are an ok underwere for ths price
These didn't quite fit my son's size 10 foot. He was disappointed.
Not what I expected.  But wearable.
"Great arch support, cute, and all around comfortable. Unfortunately, like other customers, I too found the heels of the sandals falling apart after wearing them for a month. Amazon graciously provided a replacement, so hopefully this second set will last longer!"
"I bought a kids size 3 and they are way to small, I like them but now I am stuck with boots I cant enjoy!!!
I am not going to pay shipping my self to send them back and get a bigger size that is way to much. :( SUCKS"
The purse is perfect however was sent to me with security tags attached :/ Had to find a store that could release this particular tag and that was a bit annoying :) I do love this bag tho!!!!
Even the wide is very narrow and not tall. They squeezed the tops of my sons feet. Nice looking shoes but we had to return them.
"I was so excited to get these boots as they were exactly what I'd been looking for - a neutral low heeled riding boot from a supposed ""comfort"" brand that had enough straps and buckles to make it look on trend but not so much to be tacky....ordered in a 7.5 WW (the same size I have 3 other pairs of Naturalizers in that fit great) and I can't even get my foot into the boot it's so narrow. I measured across the ""ball"" of the shoe and it's about 3.5 inches. A 7.5 WW is supposed to be about 4.25 inches across [...]

It's still a beautiful boot which is why it gets 3 stars even though I can't get them on.

I'm baffled why so many shoe manufacturers don't make a true WW...it's not like a shoe can really be ""too wide"" (at least not like it can be too narrow - and if it is, you just get a narrower shoe. Instead, they have cut me out as a customer."
"Will return this week. Would order smaller size than usual, but suspect while it would fit, still too over sized for me. Width and length seem too long, although the bagginess might be good for large guys. Fabric seems good, medium weight."
Buy a size up than your use to. Still a good quality hoody.
"I liked the appearance and coziness of these slippers but they didn't stay on my feet.  My heels slipped out of the foot bed so much that the only way I could keep them on was to ""scuff along"" in them.  I do have narrow heels but I think many feet might have the same problem in these slippers.  I'm returning them."
"They are true to size (I wear an 8 and got an 8, but I have normal sized legs and feet)but they are difficult to drive in. They are not very flexible and I don't think I would ever try to drive in them again. Also when I walk the rim on the top hurts the back of my legs."
"Kinda thin. But looks nice enough, a little bigger than expected."
I like them but I don't know if I'm just hard on glasses or what but they already have a huge scratch on them.
"Fit great when I first put them on but as the night went on I noticed they got baggy around the waist. I may need to just order a medium instead of a large. I'm 5'4"" 175 lbs. And generally wear a size 12 pants"
This dress is cute. It's cheap or-inexpensive but cute I kind of worried about putting in the washer  I think I'll wash it by hand inside out.
"The sticky comes out easily, doesnt stay for long"
"Light and comfortable but leather looks cheap and shiny, looks more like imitation leather, plastic."
Nice was larger than I was expecting. But nice to carry you tablet or I pad along with you.
Gave them to a friend!
These boots will definitely work with my wardrobe but it's not the highest quality I've ever had. I'm glad I didn't pay a lot for them. Amazon has some great prices.
"Someone had hand altered the label.  The pants were supposed to be 50 inch waist, 32 long and they were 38 inch long.  Someone had hand written 32 inches. Husband does not like the pleats.  He says the pants are too baggy."
"My two pair of Go Walks are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn.  I wanted a pair with a little different look.  I really like the look, however, my big toe was hurting after wearing them for a few hours.  These shoes seem to be about 1/2 size too small.  Wishing now I would have returned for 1/2 size larger."
"Have this watch in several other colors.  The size is absolutely perfect for a ladies wrist, but quite sporty and an easy to read dial.  This color combination (pink/brown) is unusual and classy at the same time.  Unfortunately, it arrived with the protective plastic missing from the band and the tag cut off.  I think it may have been worn before returning.  I did contact Amazon requesting a full refund, which was a speedy process. The watch itself is super nice and a great price through Amazon, if you are willing to take a chance for whats in the box."
My daughter wore it once and the lining is already ripping.  The color is beautiful
Little cheap
Probably should have bought higher quality boot to get more comfortable fit....
Great fit but had to take to shoe shop and have all the grommets replaced after 6 wks they are plastic and stared falling out
"Overall the loose sweater fits as expected. But, disappointed in the length. The photo makes the sweater looks longer in the back when it really cuts right at the small of your back."
"Top is too small, not enough coverage/support for the girls (D)."
I find it awkward to use as a roller when fully loaded.  I end up pulling the suitcase behind me versus rolling it side by side to me as intended.
was worth the price paid
a little tight in the butt area but the length is just right.
They're ok. Trendy but uncomfortable fit. Meh
"Based on reviews I bought a size too big, and should have just bought my size. They are as described, but I was envisioning something less... polyester-ey. The fabric is a thin, 1970s style polyester jersey. I was thinking they'd be kind of funky and retro, but they're just not something I would wear in public. My daughter in law said they're fine for lounging around watching tv, and they're comfortable enough.  I guess for the price they're fine but I won't buy more.  Sweatpants serve the same purpose, and you can also work out in them."
"I am an average size 8.  These were a size 8, but much too big. The strap to tighten these is very difficult to do, especially if  you have trouble bending down.  I am returning these, but in the meantime I ordered and received a size 7 1/2.  These fit much better. But I still can't figure out how to tighten  them  easily and quickly.  Once you do get them on tightly, they are pretty comfortable."
It's OK-looking but not great quality. Looks like something you could get at one of those $5 stores.
"Things I like about these stockings... #1 they are actually my skin tone... As I have gotten older (I'm in my early 30s) I have embraced my fair skin tone and I try to avoid getting too much sun (and my legs never tanned anyway). I have always bought the barely there color, because in stores it usually is the lightest color. This has always baffled me quite a bit because I don't really view myself as being pale, or porcelain... I even have a couple of friends with fairer skin.. but I was SO pleased with this color. They look nude on my skin.

Things I don't like about these stockings. I have only been able to wear each pair 2-3 times before they are just shredded. I'm not sure why this is happening, I buy other hanes stockings and don't have this issue, but the material feels less silky and all of a sudden I just get a big hole and there is no option of just spraying hairspray or putting a dab of clear nail polish to stop the run for the remainder of the day. As a bonus: since the stockings are so close to my skin color, it is barely noticeable when I get these catastrophic runs.

The stockings I have been sent are definitely not control top.... The package says they are... but these just feel like regular stockings at the waist...

This review started out as a 4, because that is how much I love the color... but based on the limited times I can wear them and not living up to their product description, I knocked it down to 3 stars... (If the color wasn't so fantastic it would only be 2 stars though). I wear stockings every week day... I can't afford to pay $8 every 2-3 days to keep me in stockings."
"Very nice and will make you look sharp, but i doubt it would last because it's shedding"
"Have to say these shoes don't feel much like my previous Asics Nimbus 14's.  They were stiff ...and felt ""cheap.""  Have broken them in now and they feel fairly comfortable, but wouldn't buy them again."
They aren't built for comfort but they are waterproof and wind proof. They do what you want them to do.
"Pretty interesting watches, lots of compliments. .. it is a shame you never know what size you will get. .."
returned these- way too narrow
"Works as a scarf, but does not feel like real cashmere...and color is not really rich-looking."
Supposed to be extra wide. They're not! Seem to be on the very narrow width. Bummer. Will give away.
"They rubbed on big toes and caused ""cuts"" so I am waiting for them to heal, they are very beautiful shoes.  I said ""somewhat small"" but I think maybe it is just the new leather rubbing against my toes that is causing them to be uncomfortable."
"The space between hooks is smaller than it is on actual bras, that makes these really inconvenient to use. I am crafty, so I can make it work, but I suggest you buy another product, if you are not good with your hands."
"i loved the color, now the material not that much, ill have to wait for classes to start to see how that goes for me and my Little one, and then ill be letting you know for sure!"
"I purchased these looking for more comfortable work boots. Alas, these are not work boots. They are more of a ""fashion"" boot. Somewhat comfortable, but returned."
"Had to return, too small. I wear a size 10 and it was too short and tight."
"The lenses arrived on time and were packaged well in a nice compartmentalized box for easy storage in my car. I rated the product ok because I bought them to reduce headlight glare, or 'eyelashes' from oncoming headlights. These glasses do brighten the night but they don't reduce or minimize the glare. Instead white lights are shaded yellow. I don't plan to return them because I do find them useful, but not for my initial problem."
Even the size 8 is still a bit small. Inside feels warm though.
I was expecting a beige color shoe.  They are a weird green.
"Waste of money. They are as they are stated which is why I still gave them 3 stars, but I saw no improvement while driving at night."
Sits below waist. Very slim fit
"Okay, bought a pair before.they were much cuter, also they scuff very easily."
Really cheap toolkit
Not what I thought I was buying.
"This blouse is a lot longer than pictured. I'm 5'2"" and this is definitely a dress on me! It covers my butt, but it's does not flatter my shape at all. Other than that, the material is soft, the sleeves are nice, and the color is beautiful. I might keep it and just use my sewing skills to cut this ""short dress"" into a blouse. Then it'd be PERFECT!"
OK for around the house
"I purchased these for my wife to help her circulation issues.  Though she liked the colors and style, the fit was not adequate for her needs.  This was no fault of the product, as she has robust leg  and foot musculature courtesy from years of kickboxing.  Though she liked the fit for her toes, they were extremely tight on her calves and left profound ""calf-dents"".

In short- for people who have stick-legs or are built like an anorexic Barbie with scrawny muscles, this may work perfectly.  For people with well-developed muscles looking to control edema, these may not be your best choice."
"Shirt is nice to the first few times you wear it, but once its been through the wash a few times, it starts to pill and the material is very thin. But the length and angled hem are great!"
"These run really really small, even though they stretch. I bought a size up even after reading their reviews. They seem sturdy and easy to wear, once you get them on."
"My husband has had many pairs of these over the last few years.  One problem seems to be that every time we order, the size is just a little different."
"This is a pretty piece.  After I got it, I decided the chain, even at 19"" was too short for me.  I gifted it to a friend and she loves it.  Looks good on any shade of blue or green."
"very cute, but arrived broken. may order again sometime"
"Good sturdy jeans with a good fit, but I wish the fly zipper was just a bit longer"
To samll.
"These are beautiful hoops, but the coating turns my earring hole green. I can only wear them for a few hours at a time before they start to turn green and start bugging me. Not real gold coating in any way, and equivalent to what you would find at low end department stores. Good for the price, just don't like how sensitive my ears become with them on."
"Too big, there is no way to wear. And the actual size does not match."
"I have 3 other pairs of Skechers and they have a wonderfully soft  memory foam, like walking on a cloud. I don't need to add an insert. These shoes are not as soft. They are nice to look at, color is perfect. I ordered the  chocolate. I ordered 1/2 size larger and the fit is great. It just lacks the soft insole I'm used to having in these shoes. I'm keeping them and passing them to any family that gets here first. They will be well used. Only not by me. I'm going to reorder."
it does not look like 30pcs but it was because i counted it the good thing about it is that it comes in different colors and patterns the bad things about it is that majority of the colors aren't cute and the ball comes off alot you will loose some.
"It didn't meet my expectations because I have flat and wide feet. When I tried them on they did not feel comfortable for my foot was not balanced, therefore unstable. I think I'm going to try the Asics next too bad not many stores have them to try on but I've only heard good things about it"
"Very nice quality sweater but sizes are off. Get 2 sizes bigger. Plus I purchases 5 sweaters, all the same size and each one fits differently. Also, I have not washed yet so not sure how they will hold up."
"I wanted to like this shoe, because it's assembled in the USA and seems to be of very good quality.  However, the styling wasn't quite what I hoped it would be - it looked a little plain and outdated - and the fit was very narrow.  I do suspect that my feet may be a little wider than I think they are, so I cannot blame the shoe completely.  However, even when tied, the gap between the eyelets was very large and made my feet look stubby.  I ended up returning them after I tried them on.

Despite my criticisms, this shoe has a lot going for it.  The outer sole and insole are both excellent. The leather is very nice, and It felt like it would be a comfortable shoe if fitted correctly.  I just didn't like the styling enough to try another size."
"I am a clydesdale and a saucony triumph fan, having worn the brand for 5 plus years, running for 20 plus years. I was sceptical about the new offset that saucony was implementing and can now say that I won't be buying any triumphs after the 8.  The offset  of the 9 seemed to affect my hips and stride. My body just wasn't ready for the change. Triumphs are a great shoe, just not for me."
"The cross is just as described and looks like the picture.
-The chains is not silver just like many reviewers pointed out. Only the cross is silver. Chain broke after 3 weeks of wearing it constantly so the quality is not great. It is average (consistent with an average price).
- After 1 month chain lost its color (dark grey). Cross still keeps its color but I am sure like any silver product it will need regular cleaning.
-Chain size is so that one cannot see the cross. It is on the chest line."
"My son absolutely loves his new super hero shirts, but he will only be able to wear them for a short time as he will grow out of them quickly due to them being not true to size."
"These boots are very cool looking and comfortable to wear.  Sizing, as seems to be the constant case with Vivibarefoot, is smaller and narrower than the models in their earlier years.  I had to get a 43 in these because the 42 was much too narrow.  My foot is wide but not so wide that I have to buy wide shoes in conventional brands.  Because the suede is soft and the boot is too long the leather just above the sole of the heal is wearing away because I step on it as I am walking.  If it wasn't for this I'd give it 4 stars.  Also, I got this as an Amazon Warehouse Deal purchase so it was less expensive so I am a little more tolerant of the wear.  If I'd paid the standard price I would be very displeased as they are quite expensive shoes and should fit and wear better."
only problem was the largest size offered was a 44 and we needed 48-50.
"I ordered an 11. That size is usually tight on me, but perfect for skinny jeans which is what I was going for here. I'm 5'8 140, small waist, wide hips. These fit TIGHT in the waist, with a higher rise than anticipated (nearly to bra line). They're loose in the hips all the way down to the knees and tight again on the calves and ankles. I won't wear 'em much. Just when everything else is dirty. 3 stars because the black acid wash is just like the picture. Bummed they look like MC hammer/genie pants though."
"Amazingly small, 1.5 sizes smaller than I usually wear-in New Balance I always go up a size, but this requires 1.5 sizes! Nice color, I ordered larger pair, we shall see. I hope to wear them on safari."
"These shoes are ok for a few hours, but I can't wear them and walk for extended periods.  They are very pretty though, and the quality is great!"
"Super tight fitting. Maybe they're supposed to be that way, but it's definitely a pain pulling baby's arms through."
"Fit as expected, but to thin for me because Im use to wearing a thick cotton underwear. Its just me though"
"Great shoes but the zipper broke after 2 months, the sole is also very week and the tongue always moves to the back of my foot"
I loved this corset as soon as I saw it so I ordered it.  But when it arrived and I tried it on I was disappointed.  But I just gave it as a gift .  They are sure enjoying it.
Very comfortable for a safety shoe But a bit pricey
"These run way big, and the whole point of a biker skinny jean is to be fitted. I washed and dried them in hot hot water. Kinda fixed the problem but not perfect. They weren't that expensive so I also went ahead and modified mine to a more current look."
Haven't noticed anything except it makes me sweat more.
I was expecting some padding in the top for the boobs!  There was none there.  I liked everything but that.
"Fit and finish were excellent.....However,I don't find the heel-strike is up to Ascics standards...These were not expensive shoes.....A factor which plays into the heel impact...."
"pretty small, for a man's head.  Did the trick for a costume, more or less."
Bought this for my son's baptism. Good enough for the occasion. Material is a bit rough though. Fabric didn't shrink in the wash.
"I wear a Large, but I saw the comments that the shirts run small so I ordered a 2xl and it's still small!!!  Disappointed,  but the design on the front is nice.  I'm still returning the shirt."
I ended up returning them -wanted black and they weren't available so I settled for the blue and they are not as oractical
"Didn't fit as expected...a little too small. I think this is the one w/the European sizes? When you look at the sizing chart, whatever size slot you fit into, I recommend going one or two sizes bigger."
"It's still in the ""getting used to"" stage."
"This looks way better in the picture than it does in real life. It's got a very prominent blue stripe, whereas it looks more pure white in the picture. But that's not the real issue. It's very baggy, but worse, too short. Granted, I'm tall, but I'm not an Amazon. What's the purpose of a shirt like this if it looks like it could fit two of you in it, but it comes only slightly below your waist?

I really can't recommend it, unless you're a size 20 and you're 4 ft. tall!"
Quite disappointed - I went up a size from the size charge so they wouldn't squeeze in my thighs and they squeeze the ever loving crap out of my thighs. They also roll really bad.
I asked my size without realizing that the cup was demi so there are somewhat small for me...but the color is gorgeous and the fabric is super soft and comfy...
"Like the shoe, not the fit."
It looks nice but was not quite as roomy for what I needed it for.  I found another bag for that and used this one for something else.  It does have a smell to it which I don't care for but is not so overpowering that I cannot use it.  I do with it zipped all the way but it is short about an inch.
"The bullet is fantastic, just wish it came with a different chain"
"Way smaller than size. So they run small, also the straps are twisted so hoping they twist straight and uniform."
"Arrived quickly, but don't work as well as pictured.  Had to use water and excess pressure just to get then to make a picture worthy foot print."
"They are amazing shoes, but they run incredibly small. For instance, I'm a size 10, but according to Jessica Simpson, I should be a size 11.5. Beautiful but small in person."
This was a gift so I can not answer
"I love the color of this skirt and it fits well; good size and a nice hip hugging shape. Attractively free below the hips. It's thinner than I expected, but I guess that's probably for the best for summer time anyway. Not sure yet if I can get by without wearing a slip. The stitching is very poor; threads hand about and some stitches are loose. I estimate that it will last 6 months or so with weekly to biweekly wear and washing. However, I guess you cannot expect exceptional quality for such a low price. Would recommend to others with the understanding that you get what you pay for in terms of quality"
Package arrived on time but not as described. It was supposed to come with an additional leather bracelet but it did not drive with package. the watch is cute but the corded band keeps coming loose and I have to re-tuck it. Not bad for the price though.
"I was looking for 100% cotton sweatpants. These are cut like sweatpants but are disappointingly thin, not the same weight and feel as traditional sweats."
"It is a nice looking costume. However, every time you move it loses hair.  There is black gorilla hair following the costume."
Same story............this was not bought for ME!
"It is not big.  Its narrow maybe half the size of the picture, not as fluffy, but very nice quality.  I will keep it."
"First of all, these were my first pair of boot and they were so comfortable. Padding all around the shaft, the heels didn't feel high at all (and I don't wear heels!). Would have been my favorite pair of shoes if only the shafts weren't so big.

Based on the website description, the boot openings were supposed to be 14.5 inches but I ordered size 8 and the openings were 16 inches. The shaft were big even with my jeans tucked in. Had to return. Very disappointed. Now, I'm not sure if the openings will go down with the size but they're 16 inches for a size 8."
The ring looks nice but is rough with sharp edges.
The suit is really cute but it is really small. I normally wear a small or medium depending on the style. I ordered a large and that was too small. I had to sew straps on the top so it didn't fall down at the pool
"Cute but pompom has hard ball inside with very little faux fur covering it, a little awkward and wobbly."
"They were cute and the one shoe that fit was good, however the other shoe was about 1/2 size too small. I have never had this problem. If I had ordered a size bigger then it would have been way to big for the other foot. Very sad, because they were super cute."
"I wear a women's size 8, and they are definitely on the upper limit for the socks. They stretch and show a lot of white through the picture when on. The length is just under my ankle bone, definitely not as high up as pictured."
"This is a very nice shoe, nice leather,  although initially I felt like they would work, after wearing them in the house for a few hours, my back started to hurt and legs, the foot bed seemed hard, I get heel pain , so always looking for something that won't kill off my heels,  and there a bit wide,  my foot slips around in them with regular thickness socks.  If you don't have wide feet , it would be easy to twist your ankle in them.  for 130.00 dollars I want to feel a bit better about my purchase so there going back.  There very nice though, and the strap I found out is for decorative purposes only I thought I read where u could put it behind the heel ,, I tried but it wouldn't work.  Not too high but still had a little height.  too bad I guess I will keep looking ."
Cute shoes but not the greatest material (can't really expect more at this price). Hated returning them but don't need a pair of boots that won't be worn more than once.
"For the price, you absolutely cannot beat these. They are the same quality as the ones you'll find in a gas station for $10-$15 each. They look nice and fit well.

However, these are very hard to see through. I personally cannot stand when sunglasses make everything darker with far less contrast. I feel less safe driving with the sunglasses than without. They cause glare and really do make things more difficult to see. They are nice if you are going somewhere with a high likelihood of losing them or breaking them, but I would recommend spending the money and getting polarized lenses that aren't mirrored."
"I love the look of these boots.  However, the sole is not very thick and after standing for an hour, my feet do hurt.  Maybe an insert might help."
"Lovely pattern, but sadly, a bit smaller than the other two skirts I've bought from this listing. Also, lots of loose threads that needed trimming."
Great product just runs smaller then expected if you are buying get it 1-2 sizes bigger
Paper thin just like all this name dresses. It's okay. THIN THIN
Go ahead and purchase the full Invicta kit.
"was smaller then I expected and I thought it had a chain.
Over all it looked nice I guess.
I gave it to my youngest and She had a chain that She put it on"
"Great to wear when you are getting a pedicure, but the fit is too floppy for the size given."
Received today as gift from wish list.  There are a few white stones missing next to green bird.  Love it other then that!
"Comfy shirts, but shrink like crazy after washing. I had to manually stretch it out just to get it close to as it was when arrived."
"It shed a little, but for the price it was perfect for my costume!  As others have stated, please note that it doesn't open. I cut it and it worked out perfectly!"
"Fabric outer shell, not plastic.  I got the brown since it was cheaper, but it seems to have a thin fabric on outside, not plastic.  Wanted plastic since thin fabric may tear easily.  Zoom in you'll see which are plastic which have fabric (lines can be seen).  Wish I'd have zoomed in..."
Color was different than in listing. But ok
"Very stiff and uncomfortable material, the print was cute."
"I did not send these back but they were filed under ""pajamas"" ... They attract lint and are a bit too soft and thin to wear for active use. The material does not have enough stretch, and kind of bags out after a lot of bending."
"They look cool and they are certainly conversation pieces for occasions like July 4th. But they are not what I would classify as ""large"" sunglasses and they certainly aren't the sort of shades you'll want to wear for their effectiveness. All in all, they are snug fitting on my big dome, but they are cool for the dough."
"Wish they were still making the ORIGINAL which is sturdier, more attractive and easier to remove. Bought the newer version as backup since the originals are starting to wear at the heel and beginning to delaminate. For now I use this newer pair as house slippers. ""Original design"" is just a clever marketing term as far as I'm concerned."
"Toeless pantyhoes are hard to find, and so although I don't love these, I'm glad to be able to get something in the way of toeless hoes, so I gave them 3 stars.  I'm 5-5 125 lb and ordered the AB size.  They have like tight bands around the top of my thighs and ride up my butt, which drives me crazy, but I discovered that a size CD is somewhat more comfortable. Admittedly, my thighs and hips are not skinny. The other thing I found disappointing is that they run so easily.  My idea of a 5 star product would be high -waisted to eliminate muffin top, more durable, and without that banding that rides up.  I normally pay about $25 for good quality high-top pantyhose, and they are actually cheaper over time, because they last.  Would that I didn't have spider veins and whiteness so I wouldn't have to wear them at all.  But not in this life."
"decent sweater, idk if the price was justified but this sweater is VERY Big & Tall, I should have bought 2 sizes smaller being a regular sized person."
Fit a bit tighter than I expected however a good sandal around the house.
"I usually love a larks, but these fit a little to long and a little too narrow.  They also seemed very cheap compared to other Clarks I have owned in the past."
"I loved these so much when they arrived I ordered 2 more pairs but like some of the other reviews, after I wore them once or twice they began to form holes along the seems in the butt area. They are so soft and comfy but if you can only wear them once or twice before they fall apart then not worth the money."
I like it I ordered the wrong size
Not as durable as I thought it would be but my husband loves it.
"Pants nice but size chart way off. My measurements said get a 3x. I'm a size 20 woman. 1x would have been plenty big. The crotch hangs half way to my knees. I can pull the waist band out front about 8"" from my body."
"I had at least 6 pairs of the 846 indifferent colors (and over time) and LOVED them so thought I'd try this shoe. I also bought at least three of those pairs online with no issues with size. But this shoe - It's only OKAY - for some reason ALL of my socks slide down on my feet in these shoes. Thought maybe my socks were bad so I bought new and they still slide down and don't with the old ones??? Weird but it is an issue I'd rather not deal with. ALso the fit seems a little tighter in the toe box but as I'm breaking them in, that seems to be getting a little better. I'll be back in the shoe stores looking for a better fit!"
"Returned shirt, since sleeves were too small, Also the color shown is not the color, beware it is a dark green"
The sleeves are way too long!  I am having 3-4 inches cut off and I have very long arms!  everything else is fine
"Very nice as a top, which is how it is being marketed at the moment.  I expected it to be a dress because that is what it was called at the time.  It really is a tunic top.  Quality is Ok."
"Very fine baby hair slips out of this after a few minutes - and the clips are tough to shut on baby heads because you have to hold them with your fingers so they click and they are very tiny.  They are darling cute, but unfortunately I think we have to wait to use them until our little one (6 months but with a TON of hair) is bigger and her hair a little less fine..."
They are very cute on but the left shoe strap hurts my ankle.
I ordered a loose size Medium Champion long sleeve tee with the logo above the heart and the logo on the wrist of the left arm. I received a loose size Medium Champion long sleeve tee with the logo above the heart and no logo on the wrist of the left arm. Disappointed.
fabric is fairly thin and rough. they tend to get so wrinkled that i cant even fold them after washing unless i iron them. cheaply made but very inexpensive.
isn't really high waisted
Bought this bag for my parents when they had to travel to Africa. It was big enough for their stuff and so far it's handling well.
"They are nice shoes. The fit is slightly on the snug side  (to me). The back is very stiff and rubs my ankles raw... honestly, they'll manage; but, I'm a bit disappointed."
"I'm a woman and am shaped like one -- Ie. my waist is smaller than my hips.  Besides being skin tight (and I ordered one size up), the waist on these is almost the same size as the hips, leaving a huge gap.  Why can't manufacturers make pants and jeans that actually fit women any longer?  I had hoped since these were stretch, the waist would actually fit.  So disappointed."
"Love hounds, but the size chart for these are incorrect they were to small. I gave them to a family member."
"love love this shoe but it is for wide feet, the strap has velcro that is not strong enough to keep the shoe on as i walked the velcro came apart.  it had to be returned for those two reasons otherwise it is a very pretty shoe ans it is pretty well made. the size is true if you have wide feet."
"I got the XL, because most products like this have wicked tight elastic that causes unflattering lines. This product had a very large waistband, which is about as far as the pleasant surprises goes. The navy color is nice. All of the material is quite thin, which is good if you want lightweight and not very fluffy. The actual crinoline layers are not very stiff at all. They don't actually feel like crinoline, but I'm not a fabrics expert. They are softer and less scratchy than most petticoats, but at the expense of volume. I don't know why I didn't realize that this product was only 2 layers, I might have reconsidered. Wearing it underneath a skirt that already has a considerable amount of built in flounce and volume to it does give it a nice added ""oomph"" though. (Sorry, I didn't get good pictures of the skirt, but all of these are with the petticoat underneath. Looks about the same without it, really. Just keeps it looking fuller when you walk and move)"
"I'm sure this was meant for children and not adults, but I bought this for my husband's Halloween costume and the mask is smaller than his face, but it still covers majority of his face and looks great! the foam cushion in the nose keeps falling out so I'll have to glue it on so it'll stay but you get what you pay for and it's good for the price in my opinion."
"Works as a cover up. Very short. Very see through. I am using it for a resort in the Caribbean. It'll work for there but I don't see this as a casual ""wear to the city pool"" cover up. For as much as you can see through it, might as well go without a cover up."
"Pros
The fit was great especially with average to narrow feet. these were the first EMS boots that I have not been swimming in the toe box.
The tred is great as well as most of the construction.
They Are Water proof!

Cons
Due to how they are laced, the leather creates a gap at the ankle. This is only an aesthetic issue.
These are the most difficult boots I have owned for donning while laced and using the zipper.
Zipper teeth on left boot have become damaged after a couple weeks of wear.
I have not found a way to contact the seller."
"Panel is okay, but the hooks were bent down to where nothing could be hung."
Comfortable and fits as expected but sole wears out quickly. For the low price it's ok. This is my second pair and I would buy again.
Wish the zipper opens all the way to the end. It would scratch my phone everytime I put it in and out. So I returned this.
"These are ok, but they are a bit loose around the legs and the cut makes them often give her a ""wedgie."" I like that they don't have the rough lacey edge, but The Fruit of the Loom style of this hem is a much better fit and doesn't wedgie."
"For what I paid for it, I did not expect top quality and top quality is not what I got. Right out if the box, the net cap underneath starting to unravel. I had to trim it because threads were long enough to get tangled in the wig. Then it knotted terribly and shead even when brushed with a wig comb. Otherwise the colors are bright and it is cute but I think this will be making its way into my 3 year old's dress up corner so she can wear when she's not busy being Elsa."
received long sleeve by mistake
"this is LARGE for a newborn .... more for a 6-9 month old,  would have loved for it to have been newborn as I thought as it is adorable"
"I ORDERED 5 O THESE BECAUSE OF THE COLORS AND THE PRICE. I HAD O IDEA THAT A 20/22 XXL REALLY IS ONLY A SIZE LARGE IN AMERICAN SIZING STANDARDS. THEY ARE BASICALLY TO COVER UP MY ARMS AND BOTTOM. I HAVE TO PIN EACH SIDE TO THE TOPS OF TANK TOPS OR T-SHIRTS IN ORDER TO KEEP THEM FROM FLAPPING OPEN ALL THE TIME.
VIBRANT COLORS AND THE MATERIAL IS GREAT BUT THE SIZING IS ALL WRONG."
"Material different than what I wanted,  a little larger than I needed, but comfortable !!!!!"
"Not as roomy as you would hope, fit for for a big boy than young man. :/"
"I ordered a large and there's no way that the sizing on the leggings match the sizing chart. But i donated them, so someone will find good use."
Lightweight.  Good quality for the price.
I really like the shoes but they we're the wrong size. I called to get the right side but they didn't have my daughter size. I appreciate all the effort in sending them on time
"Sleeves are to long and extend half way to my palms. The material and style is good. I should have bought a small. I went according to the Amazon size chart but was a bit large.
Does anyone know how can I return this blazer to the selller in exchange to a size small  or can I Taylor it?"
"i am usually a size 7 or 7.5, went with the 7 and its a bit big, if you are an inbetween size like myself (i tend to do a 7 when a half size isn't an option and 8 is usually too big for me). Otherwise not  bad."
"It's just ""okay"".  I think the neck opening is too large as well as the length of the arms but it's a good item for a good price."
"it is a nice bracelet a cute gift for someone.my problem is I only got to wear it once.& it broke I had it on & took my dog for a walk.& when I got home that's when my son said hey your heart is missing from your bracelet.so well
that was a waste of money. I have many of bracelet's & none of them came apart like that. I feel that I am owed a replacement .thank you."
love the color.  love the feel. love the fact it come with eye shields but so did my dog.  husband likes it too
"Love, love, love these boots.  They are so comfy and keep my feet toasty warm.  Look so cute with my skinny jeans.  Would definitely buy again!"
Really nice chain...looks great with or without anything attached
"Nice heavy looking ring, i know people are looking at this ring becasue one guy stop me and told he ,he too was a Mason, and he love the way the ring looked"
The skirt is well made and stretchy which hugs the body better. I'm 99lbs 5'2'' and ordered a S. The bow looks great at your waist. I also got the red roses in black one but the material is not stretchy so I returned it.
Cant see sideways while wearing. Not good for riding bikes.
"Very nice, just like the picture and came with a free chain necklace. Very pleased! Shipping was fast."
"Nice shoes - cool style. if the arch support is too much, you can easily remove the extra material. Comfortable and fits true to size."
Gorgeous...love it.
"I originally ordered a medium because I am small on top and medium at the waist.  I returned the medium for a small as it was much too large for me.  The small size fits me perfectly.  I love my new coat.  The plum color is growing on me (I originally wanted chili, red, but this color was not available in small).  If you are looking for a true rain coat, keep in mind, this coat does not have a hood."
"Sexy, but wish the tube top had some stay up elastic at the top."
Beautiful quality! Great to do business with!
I love this wallet!  It arrived exactly as detailed description said it would be. Nice leather.  Love all the compartments.
love it just what  I wanted
Very comfortable socks for running or work.
"Cute little girl's sandals.  When she increased a size we just ordered another pair.  Good value, cute shoe"
cute~
I got this for my scrubs and the fit is perfect.  I love the color and the quality is excellent.
My college athlete loved them!  Says she is the envy of all her teammates in the gym.
"These seekers are the best, I wear them daily. I even wore them on my trip to Walt Disney World for a light shoe they are very supportive. When the time comes I will buy again to replace them... Additional Note I am a 6 foot tall woman with size 12 feet, and unlike a lot of other shoe I have purchased they don't make my feet look like boats either! The markings are just enough to break up long lines!"
"Very very beatiful shows with incredible fit, very light Wright and perfect for runnig. Would recomenda for everyone that wants a high Quality product with a great design."
"I'm very happy with this purchase. This is a heavy weight open front sweater. I live in the Midwest and this sweater is perfect for an extra layer. It's not cheap looking and the Owls aren't ""silly"" looking so I wore it to my office with a belted blouse and heels and received many compliments. It's a long sweater. Im 5'4 and it comes half way down my thigh. The sleeves are a bit long, had to cuff them.  I wasn't expecting much as the cost was so affordable, but am happily surprised. Also, the shipping was very fast. Received in about 2 weeks."
They fit good and are amazingly comfortable considering they are high heel boots!  :)
"I am very happy with these boots; warm, comfortable and stylish."
It met all my expectation.  I needed for a Mask photo shoot on models.  It was a metal but quite flexible to bend to adjust to model face.  It was beautiful and classy.
I've bought several of these through the years as gifts.  It is a roomy fit.
Arrived promptly & was as pictured
The waist fits perfectly.  The legs are wider/baggier than the picture shows.  Wrinkle-free.  easy care.
Work superbly especially with suitcases with relatively smaller zippers
she loves this great outfit
"Gift for my teen aged son, he is a DJ and he loves it."
"Looks as it does in the picture. This belt is very lightweight and I don't expect it to last a long time however for under $5, it's a bargain. I ordered a 38 and it is the precise length it should be."
I ordered the size I would have purchased in a local store and it fits.  Very comfortable with room for when moving around.
I order bigger and very happy with it it is a little thin you can see thru it.
"looked well on hubby, I would buy again"
"As almost all  Anne Klein shoes  love them!  They are made of a great leather quality, nice style; they are very comfortables, I wear them all day long because I a a teacher, and I don't feel pain on my feet.  They look very nice."
"My dad loves these! Great gift for him, very confortable, excellent shape. Well there is not doubt with clarks"
Good shoe that can be worn with a causal or somewhat dressy outfit.
Clarks have always been comfortable.
Excellent feel and fit
Love the texture and is very comfortable. The size was a little too big.
I'm 5' 10' and a very light 255lbs after a glass of water. It fits just fine. I normally wear xl so it's what I went with. If it gets too tight then it's time I lose some weight. I usually have on Columbia pfg but I like the design of the huk. Both work fine for me. It sucks that companies like these have to outsource to save a few bucks in production but that capitalism for yah.
"This is a well made, comfortable, and stylish shoe for an affordable price. I am quite happy with my purchase and would order these in another color."
These are the best. I have another set and used them for the first time on a trip and what a joy. Changed hotels 5 times and never had to unpack and always knew where my things where. I just ordered this set for my husband to use on our next trip
"Fit as expected, order Medium. I'm 5' 2"" 36 C bra. Thin material, but it looks great and it's a very formal dress for work."
"I generally wear an 11.5 in the widest width I can get. As I've gotten older, I suffer from edema in my feet so I typically buy larger sizes to accomodate the swelling. These work well, but due to my own physical issues, I only wear them for a few hours.  That's not to say that they won't work well for others that don't have the same problems. They are comfortable. I'm happy with them."
The size runs true. The shoe is very comfortable without being heavy. I have another pair of Saucony's so I expected nothing less.
"I love them and they help with Plantar Fascitis...However, they run small...so buying next size up from normal size."
Perfect for sleeping and lounging around the house
"My daughter loves these flip flops, however they run a little small"
"Love them, they are so cute and comfortable!
Great value for the brand."
"I love these sneakers. They are comfortable and have pretty good cushions...unlike my Converse. I love my converse, but I did need to had an insert for arch support. I get lots of compliments on them. I wear them on Casual Friday's at work with a pair of skinny jeans, a white Tshirt, biker jacket and a Pearl and Chain Choker...Tough girl chic."
Super comfy and cute. I own several Clarks sandals and I wear them all day long without feeling tired at all.  They look so stylish. I get compliments.  The color is really nice.
"A T-shirt with a beautiful message, a good material and beautiful colors."
"Perfect fit for somebody who use to buy Columbia's shirts. If not you have To select a size small er than you use. For examine, I use large in others shirts. In Columbia I use medium and fit me perfect"
"Really nice pair of sunglasses.  Look great, comfortable to wear and the polarized lenses are crystal clear.  These seem like a much more expensive pair of sunglasses, great value."
Got this for a Student for his birthday. ... The sword is sharp just FYI. I didn't know this until the student started treating everyone like a Chuchu and I had to take it away until school got out. :/
good quality outdoor shoes
"Thick, strong leather. Carhartt recommends buying one size larger than your pants. I'm 38"" so I bought 40"". It fits perfectly. I'll probably buy another one."
Holy Cats!  Stole this watch...what a wonderful machine for the price its incredible!
"Like the color, fit great with  my helmet , shipping on time,  awesome product."
My sister wore this on her wedding day. She wanted something that fit well and she didn't have to worry about. On the plus side the undies are cute and flattering
Bought this to replace a microswitch on a key fob.  Much cheaper than buying a new fob and it worked fine.
I am normally a shoe size 7.5 but i bought a size 7 and they fit perfect. They are very comfortable. I plan on using them for an upcoming vacation to the beach.
"I normally wear a size 9, these run small and the 10's I ordered fit perfect! Just enough room for a gel insole, which makes them comfortable enough to wear all day."
"I bought these thinking they were going to be a nice addition, and they were, initially.  The second day I wore them, one fell out, without my knowledge and the waiter brought it to me.  The clasp was broke.  When I tried to return them, I was told they were ineligible for return.  I would have loved to get a replacement on these because they are so beautiful.  $10 wasted."
"Stunning earrings, timeless and classic. Can be dressed up or down. I agree with another reviewer, these do look a lot more expensive than they are. Purchased as a birthday gift for my sister; hopefully she will love them! Sidenote: these look just the same as pictured. The blue topaz is fairly light, similar to blue diamond hue. Very pretty ear sparklers. The earwires/leverbacks appear to be sturdy and well made."
love them just got my earrings today worth the money packed well will order again soon.
good it
"This sweater is really nice.  It is  comfortable and looks very pretty on.  I got the grey color and may get another.  Also, thanks to Pauline for answering my question.  Since I am between sizes I ordered up and it fits perfectly . I recommend this sweater.
."
This is my third pair over many years and I love them.
Love Birks!
This shoe is slightly larger size. But that's okay. I bought a size 7 for my daughter in her leg when ruchkory circle on a sheet of paper 14 cm Size 7 has enough space to put a sock.
"Great fitting and works as expected with touchscreens.  This glove really shines with increased wind, I barely even notice it with these on."
Love this top beautiful design and very good material
Great replacement bag since my last one broke. Convenient size and fits everything I need.
Nice material a little tight in the arms nice color well made
A tad smaller than expected but very pretty
"When you need a Bill Lumbergh costume, look no further.  Mmmmkay?"
"Stylish maternity swimsuit that provides good coverage. The straps don't cut into your shoulders and are comfortable to wear for hours on end. I like that the straps are adjustable, as well. Flattering design and cut! =)"
"I love these shirts,,,,,, and you will too !!"
"am 69 , and still working part time. work in a large warehouse pulling orders,have developed hammer toe and my feet were killing me covering 2 or 3 miles aday pulling orders. read some of the reviews on this shoe and thought would give them a try. they are just great , but like some of the reviews said buy a size larger and glad i did,try them you will love'm"
Very nice quality and excellent price
"Even though I returned this item, I really liked it alot. The shorts are not as high waisted as in the picture though. The reason I returned it is because my body was really not in shape to wear this outfit but I definitely think petite females could really rock this outfit."
Comfortable and color perfect dark navy blue.  Bought it in several more colors.
My company workers loved it
"Well made, heavy, and will be great in cooler weather"
"Beautifully made. Easy to open, yet stays closed.  Great quality and condition. Gets lots of compliments."
"Very comfortable, and soft.  Unfortunately does not offer arch support."
The boob coverage isn't that great on the sides.
"My husband loves these!! In ordered 2 and he told me to order more! Fits great and sturdy material. He's always been a Savane user,  but these seem better quality than the usual ones he's ordered in the past."
"Great fit. Love the orange color. The brown skirt is really a deep red not brown at all. Stretchy cotton. Light and breezy, great for hot summer days. Modest skirt length. True to size."
Wear these at least once a week. Currently my favorite boot.
I cannot begin to explain how AMAZING this product is; it's FAMTASTIC! My husband loves it; it will be great for stage performances. You can't go wrong with this purchase!
My favorite blouse from now on.
"I bought these as a valentines day gift for my girlfriend
she has worn them and it worked with the red dress"
Love these shoes for my kids!
"My daughter emailed me with a link to these boots on a different site, asking me to 'use my magic' to find them online, hopefully at a lower cost than the ones she had found. I found them on Amazon, then decided rather than refer her to them, I would simply buy them for her upcoming birthday at the end of September. She lives in another state, but flew home the day I placed the order. They arrived during her visit, and she went nuts over them! (this was before she even opened the box).After squeezing the sh*t out of me with a hug, she grabbed the boots and put them on. They were gorgeous at first sight! They fit exactly the way she hoped, they looked the way she had hoped, and in fact, she wore them Friday evening to an event only a few hours after getting them! She wore them for about 7 hours, and commented that they were still comfy. BEST hundred bux spent for her, if I do say so myself! Great job, Chinese Laundry, and bravo, Amazon Prime, for once again coming through for me, with next day shipping for a mere 3.99, which was so so worth it! Buy them, you'll love them!"
"If you have a wide foot, keep these on for a couple hours even if they're too tight at first. I have a wide foot and was concerned when I first put these on. After a day or two walking in them they are now very comfortable."
"I love it!!!!
Keeps all the fat in the bra and fits snug. Love the wide Elastic."
"I got the large size.  It is 46.5"" long.  It is comfortable.  Is substantial enough to hold my phone's belt clip.  So far so good.  My previous belts (there were many) were leather braided (mostly Dockers brand) and they are always tearing up.  At 1/3 the price for this belt - I'm happy and hope it lasts at least as long as the leather style."
Good quality. Well sewn. Very comfortable. I would buy them again.
Does what I expect of a t-shirt.  Better made that some I have had and I will order this company's products again
Bought these for my sister to make shirts for my little guy and I love them!
Nice quality and quick delivery.
"This arrived the other day and I have to say I was really impressed with the high quality.  Even the packaging was something that screamed luxury and high class.

My husband is wearing it today for the first time.  Even though it comes with a kit to make adjustments, it fit him perfectly so we didn't need to use the kit.
He's worn magnetic bracelets in the past and it's really helped him with some health issues including back pain, so we're hoping this one will be the same.
I received this bracelet at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion."
"I bought this wallet to carry a varity of items including cash and change. It appears well made, and is very roomy. It definitely was what I was looking for."
Super cute! Covers the right areas perfectly. Great fit
the pants do not have pockets...other than that everything is a-ok
No camel toe! :) Fit great and I wear them for CrossFit WODs. Love them and bought them in all colors.
"I love these work pants.  They fit as expected.  They are a good mid-weight - not too heavy or rigid, but still tough and good for year round wear.  Pretty darn durable as well.  I bought my first pair of these on Amazon a little over a year ago.  I wear them quite frequently for work, and they have held up great. Dickies are usually a great value, but I have had issues in the past finding the right size with some Dickies styles -which is incidentally my biggest complaint about Dickies, overall.  There seems to be no consistency from style to style (or even sometimes with differing colors of the same style) regarding sizing and fit for Dickies pants.  The styles of Dickies that Walmart carries seem to run about a size and a half too small.  I typically wear 34x30, and I couldn't button the Wal-Mart Dickies in that size with a pair of vice grips.  However, the 36x30 in the same style are way too baggy for me.  I also had the same problem with the first pair of Dickies I tried from Amazon - https://smile.amazon.com/Dickies-Mens-Relaxed-Duck-34x30/dp/B000PSVEUW/ref=sr_1_1?s=apparel&ie=UTF8&qid=1490228952&sr=1-1&nodeID=7147441011&psd=1&keywords=Dickies%2BMen's%2BRelaxed%2BFit%2BDuck%2BJean%2C%2BMoss%2C%2B34x30&th=1&psc=1.  Luckily, I found these that actually do fit, and I have been extremely pleased."
"These pants are so comfortable. I was worried the legs would be too tight, I've got pretty big thighs. However, they fit so nice from waist to toe.  (I'm 14/16 and got an XL). The only complaint I would have it they are quite long, nothing a hem can't take care of.  I wore them traveling and they were perfect."
I feel very sexy in these shoes
Very cute and nice quality. Purchased this for my grandson looks so adorable on him.
For the price it's ok. It gets the job done
"Good value, nice belt. Frayed end is in the design, not a malfunction, but I wish it was covered in leather such as regular web/canvas belts. However it has a great look and feel, wears nicely."
"Just as pictured.  The stones appear to be pretty solid (don't look like they're going to fall out anytime soon).  Fits well, easy to wear.  Really like it!"
"135, 5'4"" and I wear a size 8 normally. I ordered the 9 and it was perfect fit for me. I don't like the three buttons because they go high & I muffin top so if you aren't sporting that look- you should be good to go. I wear it with a flowy shirt to hide my ghetto-ness."
"It is comfortable after a couple of uses, the first couple of times I found the material to be a bit more itchy than I could tolerate, with a couple of washes became better."
"Bought this for my son for Christmas. He hasn't put it on yet, but it will fit perfectly! The shipping was super quick too!"
"ARRIVED QUICKLY. AS DESCRIBED, GOOD PRICE"
"Basic set of socks an nice range of colors.

 Fit is OK but Im not sure how you would go at the larger ends of the scale. Not real thick but they are not designed to be and come in a really small box which makes you wonder how they can get six sets of socks in there until you see how small they are.

 They stretch OK but are less stretchy than regular socks in my opinion which means you have to put them on the right way otherwise they won't fit. Still, they fit so little to complain about - Ill update if any issues after a wash.

 Product provided for review - its just my opinion."
"So far I like it a lot but rating it a 4 since it is a bit smaller than I expected. It holds a lot but a little snug. I was looking for something I can carry a small notebook, iPad, phone and kindle with some pens, chargers, headphones and a small bag with feminine products, lipstick, IB, powder and a small travel brush. All these items fit but I can't zip it up. My sunglasses case made it difficult to get in so I had to just keep them in the car which is disappointing since I usually need them when I am also not in the car. I love the side pocket on the side of the purse not front. My iPhone 7 plus fits perfect in it. I have a mophie charging case that makes the iPhone bigger and bulkier and it fits in nice. Overall I like it and will keep it but its not my favorite for functionality but a favorite on look."
Works as intended
Great comfort for me.  Pretty soon the style will be discontinued.  So try to get many as you can for your comfort.
"Just as pictured, with sleeves on the shorter side of ""long"" but it fits as expected and is true to size.  I am a US M.  I ordered that size and had no issues."
The shirt fit exactly as the size chart indicated and it arrived in the time stated. The shirt has a very nice bright vibrant color and has double Stitch scenes and a nice collar that stays even after several Washings. Very good quality shirt.
"Bought as a gift for my brother. Needless, to say it fit and he loved it. He's an otaku and it fits his personality perfectly."
"Purchased so many from other choices on line trying to find the right size and fit, right style and cuteness and almost gave up when I decided to give it one last shot before I headed to the store to pay much more than anyone needs to.
So I gave this a shot and boy, am I glad I did. This is all that and then some. I purchased the tortoise because I plan to have my transition lenses transferred and I find the dark lenses look much cuter with a brown frame.
I have a broad face and these are just the right size. Not consuming  nor conspicuous. They just compliment. I also tried them on my sister who has a much narrower face and they are also perfect. So they will work for anyone. They seem very sturdy and do not look cheap at all. Famous brand names have only one thing one these...their exorbitant prices, which we do not need.
I am  recommending these with all my heart. I want all of us girls to look really cute when we step out."
I love all the colors of these shoes. They're fairly comfy for a wedge. I usually put in an insole. I wear an 8.5 and this is pretty snug. Next time I'll order another 9 and an the insole.
"My first purchase of a swatch. It came in exactly as described. Nothing really super fancy about the watch in itself except that the styling with the double band on your wrist is what you pay for. This is obviously for an adult/grown up in size but I believe you could buy it from 12+ year old kid, depends on their wrist size."
These are nice shoes. I will enjoy wearing them.
"I love these boots. I've had Frye, Red Wing, Timberlands, the list goes on, and these may be the nicest boots I've ever owned. The construction and quality of the boots is top notch. They're simple, sturdy, and easy to dress up or down. They look great with jeans, chinos, and even wool pants if you like. They do take a little to break in and the soles are hard - these are not sneakers! They're boots! Also, I wear a 10 in Nikes, a 9 in Cole Haan and these I needed an 8.5. So take that for what it's worth and size down."
I really love this top it does fit a little big but I don't like really tight scrubs it does have stretch there is a little hook on it I think thats for a badge in any case I think that it should be moved to the top shoulder for most badges you have wear there now
"Love the color, the fit was good, and I wore them all day and they were comfortable. Would like a bit more arch support for a longer day of standing."
"This is very cute. It's a decent size, but you have to look a little closely to make out the mother and child. From a distance it's a sort of stylized heart shape, so if you're not into jewelry in concrete shapes, this might still work for you. I thought the 18"" chain might be a little short, but it's just right.

As with other Amazon pendants, the clasp can be a little tricky, but that's not a huge deal."
Good quality and service glad I  purchased.
Pretty but a little bit heavy!
"I love these slippers! I found these a few years ago and now they are the only ones I want.  Great arch support!  They are very warm and feel so cushiony! I couldn't find any in the stores at the end of the season, so ordered 2 pairs so I could wear one while washing the other."
Very pretty but too big. Sent back and ordered another one in smaller size.
Great fit and looksee very stylish
Shield goes well with Captain America costume I ordered for my son. The price is a little too high for the product in my opinion considering its just plastic.
Love the shirt. Bought large and it fits great and I have long arms. Usually wear XL.
"Delivered on time, quality good."
Perfect! Very slimming!
"Product fits perfectly, I am happy with it and it works perfectly for what I am using it for. I bought a large because that's the size I am in in women's tshirts."
"The ring is beautiful with lots of sparkle and a bargain of a price for what it is. It's about 4 mm across where the stones are and about 3 mm wide for the band. The prongs on the smaller side stones were a little sharp, but clear nail polish took care of that problem easily. If you're looking for bling at an affordable price, this ring won't disappoint."
Nice shirt. Decent quality and fit. Will purchase more.
"These fleece pajamas are exceptional. Comfortable, warm, quality fabric with beautifully sewn piping on the jacket and pant legs. The Small runs a bit large for my height of 5' 1"" and 106 pounds. The pant legs are several inches too long, but can easily be rolled up or put inside the top of an Ugg style boot."
Great pants! They were perfect for my son!
Product packaging smelled but after washing the smell was gone. Loved the way it fit and how the material felt. I ended up ordering 2 of these.
Item received as expected. I would recommend and order from this merchant again.
"Great price and it came quickly I order one to make sure..it was perfect, I'm the type of person that doesn't like padded bra. Very comfortable and cool to wear. It's true to size Try it you will like it!"
Adorable! Love this outfit and its super soft
Good quality slippers thanks
"Fits good, a bit tight from the bust area, so if you have a large chest I would suggest going up a size, other them that dress fits great, nice flow and fabric is not heavy or statikie. Very satisfied with my purchase!!!!"
Good quality and classy from afar and fun up close. You can where it to any event for work or pleasure.
I love these shirts to wear under my scrubs. Very comfortable and long lasting.
Love it. Very roomy for all my jewelry
"Just buy a
Little."
Fits as spect to my wife
fits well and was warm on those cold days
"Omg. I'm so happy I ordered these! Expensive but we'll worth it! They fit perfectly. I did get a size bigger than normal due to other reviews. It was a good idea since they fit perfectly now. Also, it told me my boots wouldn't be here until Tuesday, guess what? It's Saturday!!! I'm wearing them right now thanks so much! I'm glad to find a wide calf that isn't too wide for me! The average calf is 15inch and under, mine are 15 and 1/2 and these aren't quite snug so they fit great!!!!! I will be ordering more in the future with this company."
Comfy and snug but a little large. My boyfriend is slim and a size medium. Medium was pretty big.
These are perfect! Except they run small I bought diff rings and the are all so tight it's cuts blood circ off. I  have to check to see if they have half sizes as a whsole one would be tooo big!  Beautiful though!
My husband says nothing feels better than new underwear & socks!  These are his new favorites too.
i love my ring
Love the style and fit. I had another pair that I wore for years that held up great.
These are amazing great fit
This is my favorite item the feel of how soft it is and how long is amazing. You can wear it so many ways. I even wear it warped around my head and tied on the side for that New York look.
comfortable!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Magnifico; excellente; wunderbar; grrreat.  Yes, I do love these boots.  I do not see how they could be any better - for me.  They are quality, through and through, and quite comfortable too.  I think it's obvious - I highly recommend these boots.  Par excellance!  Or something like that.  Get some!"
"This was an amazing costume!  i received a lot of compliments and dazzled all the tricker treaters.  Thank you so much for the quick delivery too.  So very happy with the top quality of the material, definitely not one to say it was a one-time only costume.  It will definitely last a few years."
"This bra fits well, and is comfortable for all day wear. I do find that the cups don't stay down when unclipped as easily as I would like, and I assume that is due to the light padding. I do, however, like the padding. It's not so much that my breasts look bigger (I'm a 34f so that is a big plus) but it is just enough to provide a bit of modesty coverage. It's also great for hiding small leaks so you can catch them before they soak through your shirt!"
Thank you for your quick service. I have been looking for a pair of black oxfords and these are fantastic. They look great with dress slacks and dresses. They are really a very well made shoe. As far as size I am a 8 1/2 and they fit perfectly.
"There wasn't a braking in period, just put them on and went."
Great watch.  Very classy and a great movement.  Have received many compliments.
"I have always love the comfort technology that sketchers shoes have. Since i am a sporty kind of woman who loves to play badminton, running, walking, jogging, biking and etc., i always look for comfortability in my foot wears as my main priority and this shoes did not disappoint me.  The arching is just smooth  as it supports you feet as you do the run, walk, jog movement as you land on the ground. You can definitely wear this whole day long without any problems. Super love it."
"I like this, it's a nice thin short sleeve cardigan that you can wear over a tank in the summer or a long sleeve shirt for a layered look in the cooler months. Versatile, not to heavy. CUTE! I bought three colors, the white fits perfectly, the coral and pink one I bought seem a little more snug, but still work for layering."
I am very impressed with the booties!
"So far I love these shoes, am preparing for a marathon, no blisters, no rubs, I did 16 miles yesterday and my feet are fine.  Very pleased, and i love the color combination, a little colorful but not too flashy.  I think I'm sold on brooks, I was always a NB wearer but I think I might be a permanent convert.  I like a wider toe box and these deliver, no pinching on that little toe.  Of note, I usually wore a 7.5 in NB but I bought the 8 in these and they at first felt a little big but they are perfect, no toes hitting the tip of the shoe on those downhills.  Happy trails!"
The fabric feels like it's very well made and the shirt fits nicely as well.
"They are not as cute as others, like the Ash Croco colored one or the blue and red croco ones in the same style; however, if you need a white pair, for the price, they are very comfortable and you can get away with the looks."
Wonderful earrings . Very nice size and not real heavy. I highly recommended.
This pant keeps me cool beautiful and comfortable
"Good quality, lovely and comfortable"
"so cute, can't wait to wear them - love Hue tights!"
"I normally wear a 16 to 1X top and the 1X has plenty of room every where. It could also double as a cute maternity top without looking like a maternity top. The color is really nice. I would call it a Periwinkle color. The material is very soft and thin with LOTs of stretch for summer days. I Like the 3/4 sleeves. Not see through material.

I really love Lucky brand Women's tops, but I don't think this is a good fit for me with the baseball shirt type shoulders. It just makes me look bigger than I am. X1 is my size though, maybe I am too old or busty to wear it. The model has much broader shoulder than me, and it hangs well on her.
I can't really take stars away because the product doesn't suit me. I am sure it would look nice on many women. It really is a nice T to wear with Jeans."
sexy without being slutty.  Perfect
So comfy! I'll be getting more.
Disco baby
"While I still like this hat and it certainly will be fine for my purpose - it's not quite as pictured.

The point of mine is droopy not pointy and upright as pictured. That isn't too bad and sort of adds a twisted wicked witch thing but the real disappointment is the brim.

There is a head covering that is fitted into the hat and the brim - and that is cool, keeps the hat snugged down and looks sophisticated... but the brim, although bent like shown, doesn't line up so that it has that nice graceful curve over the front. Instead it's about half way off. It will work but it isn't quite as cool as the picture."
"Alas there is more of me than there used to be, but the duck material is not as heavy as the pair they replace."
"Love these heels.  First of all they're beautiful, the red color is a dark cherry, not bright.  But, they are also very comforable.  The heel is a high heel, yet I could walk in them all day long."
"I ordered the BLACK color choice, hoping to match these slacks to a nice black blazer I own.
I'd classify them as a very dark matte grey. Compared with my other black clothing, they're a shade or two lighter.
For those looking for true black color dress trousers, try elsewhere.

If that's not an issue, I'd concur with the majority here; these khakis feel soft and elegant, fit nicely and look good."
This is my 3rd pair of these sneakers. Really like them.  Would definitely buy again.
"Pretty, but I had hoped for a little smaller radius of the metal itself - not the size of the earring."
My husband likes them for comfort and warmth. He said they fit perfect. He's talking about buying more.
"Was having trouble with underwires in bras, and these fixed that immediately! Very soft and comfortable to wear all day."
"I purchased this for my comic-book nerd boyfriend and he absolutely loves it.  It has stitching!  That's what he keeps saying.  I guess because the stars and stripes are sewn rather than printed, it's a big deal for him.  It's made from quality materials, it hasn't faded.  The only thing I can say about this t-shirt if that if you're waffling between sizes, go with the larger.  It doesn't stretch out over time."
Very cool bootie.
"these are really nice shoes. the price was reasonable, maybe nobody wants gold? the heel is low. it's hard to tell what the color is from the picture. the main part of the shoe is basically gold, the toe is more a bronze color. i bought them to wear to a wedding without much expectation that i would wear them a 2nd time. they're the 4th pair of trotters i have bought in the past couple of years, they're a good brand i think."
i needed boots  to wear to a wedding.  I saw this and decided to gamble and purchase it.  I knew I could return it if it did not meet my expectations.  It was inexpensive for a boot. Wow!  What a surprise when it arrived.  It is perfect for the dress I am going to wear. Perfect fit and beautiful.
I ended up going back to Hanes after trying a number of other brands and styles.  I would be happier if the sizes didn't cover such a wide range so the fit would be just a little bit better.
"Stuffed paper in the ears to keep them in shape, otherwise, pretty good.  The back is slit vertically, with long strip of velcro to keep it closed.  It fit large adult.  Of course, it is hot and sweaty after a while."
"I have to review this jacket because it has lasted over a year for us. My son is small for his age so take that into consideration. We bought this in November, 2015 when he was 8 months old and at 22 months, this size still fits (snugly but it fits). It's one of the only 6-12 things he still wears. He wears 18-24 mo in most pants and shirts. This is a fantastic jacket to wear in the car seat as it's not bulky at all and was recommended by the Car Seat Lady blog. It's been appropriate for temps as low as 40s and 50s. I plan to buy him a 2T next and let him grow into that one. Given how inexpensive this is, I was even more pleased it lasted that long. I wouldn't say there's much stretch to it but I feel it runs larger than normal shirt sizing. It's the perfect fall or early spring jacket and a great first layer for much colder temps."
"This dress is perfect. It fit as expected. Although the packaging sucks, but no big deal just put it on a clothes hanger and hang it on the shower curtain. Turn the HOT water on and close the bathroom door let it run about 30 then turn off the water off. Let them hang in the bathroom for at least another 30 minutes. Now take it out side and hang it up. Let it dry. Now just fluff the ruffles and is good to go. I apsolutly love this dress. Oh and one more thing, it is a 2 piece outfit."
got the wrong size so I gave it to my daughter
"This was a gift for a friend who is on his feet all day as a personal trainer, but he reports that he is immensely pleased with the fit and durability.  Absolutely no complaints."
"Love Levi's jeans and the 550 fits me the best. The pants I bought are black with a black leather label with silver letters. The small Levi's tag is red. Not faded, not washed, the jeans have a new look but are not stiff. The thing that pleases me the most is buying them from Amazon. I take a popular size and when I go to the department store my size is more often than not ""sold out"". How nice it is to not only have my size but also a choice of colors!"
"A light, lovely and luxurious pair of silver earrings which add to the finishing touch of my daily wardrobe wear."
Sparkly and true to size. Bigger thank expected.
amazingly warm
"Got this for grand-daughter age 3. Wears it on the beach after swimming is done. It is light, and airy and so cute she loves to wear this. It needs to be washed in gentle cycle or by hand, material is pretty delicate but decently made."
To the batmobile! Fun boxers
I buy my sweatshirts one size bigger so that I can wear other clothing like another sweatshirt underneath. This way II can dress in layers during the winter months.
"This is my 3rd pair, they are so comfortable right out of the box. I do wish they had a pertective toe cap though."
Looks of pockets and good quality construction
"These are really cute, i have big calves but having the lace all the way to the top allows them to fit perfectly. I am between a 7.5 and 8 in shoes so i bought the 8 and they fit just right."
This necklace is to cute! People actually think it's a real camera!
Helpful organization tool for packing and traveling.
"Got this to replace my wedding ring and band that I accidentally broke while working on our Ford Expedition together. I wanted something lightweight that wouldn't break, as well as something smooth that would never scratch me or our young children.

It shipped quickly, and looks pretty, but it's very thick, and a little bit loose on my finger. If it was a 4 1/2 instead of a 5 and half as thick I might like it more. We got a great deal on the price, but I don't know if I'll be able to wear it 24/7 like I would like to."
These shoes my child as I expected they would. Glad they have wide sizes.  Nice shoe for the money.  I would recommend this product to others.
"Great 2 piece that prevents having to check a bag, and still looks good!  Love the brown and pink, and it's so convenient to pack and carry on everything for a week, or two if packing right.  Love this set! It's lightweight too!"
"For the price, it's unbeatable!!! Lightweight, durable, well-made ... and it packs into its own pocket."
"The product is outstanding and the company is great to work with!  I initially ordered the wrong size by mistake and the company handled the exchange perfectly.  Couldn't be happier with how the product works.  Super easy to use and makes your collar stand up perfectly all day long.  It is simply a brilliant idea - one of those ""why didn't I think of that"".  You will not go wrong ordering this product."
"These shoes are really comfortable to stand in, but the plastic coated strip up the top of the toes means they bend really oddly and rub on your toes when you run (or otherwise flex the toe box). I'm hoping that this is something that'll loosen up/break in over time, but the first few wearings have definitely made me aware of this flaw! It's not painful, per se, but it's just irritating enough that I think over multiple miles, it could end up ouchy.

The cushioning, however, is GREAT. I really appreciate Altra for making zero-drop running shoes that still have that ground-protection. I run mainly on asphalt and while I love my Nike Bionic Frees and New Balance Minimus Zeros for sprints and gym work, I like a little more padding between me and the gravel and concrete when I'm putting in the miles!

Aesthetic note: be aware that the colors are SUPER bright and, when combined with the wide toe-box, can remind you of clown shoes or bowling shoes. I don't find this a drawback, personally, but I understand why someone else might."
The color is different than what was showed. It looks more like earth tone than Mandarin.  Individual who has width feet would not be able to fit the shoes
Great quality for the price.  I would definitely recommend!
nice quality and fit. will order this brand again. true to size.
Love these for my 80's outfit! PERFECT!
I just bought this to wear to a Chinese costume party and for six dollars I think it's great!  Obviously you would not want to wear this every day  but for a dress up adding it's perfect.  Delivered promptly with prime!
Very pretty but way to small
"Frankly, it is under-priced for how nice it is; I'm glad I got introductory pricing!!
The satin outer surface feels luxurious!!  The inside is soft cotton that feel wonderful... it's a joy to wear.
I haven't owned it long enough to comment on durability, but it feels well constructed and robust.
If I have any future issues with durability, I'll update this review; otherwise, if this review is unmodified after a year or two, you can assume that I have remained as happy with it as I am now!"
Very cute and well made! Fits as expected!
What a nice surprise! Ordered these for a wedding and not only did they fit well - they were comfortable! Something in the shoe makes an odd click but it doesn't happen when I walk. Perhaps it's part of the sole of the shoe.
I LOVE how these scrubs feel when I'm wearing them!!!
"They are a perfect fit for my son who is 6'3"". Great pants especially for the price!"
This shirt is as cute as could be but I should have ordered a size larger.  It was slightly snug and has shrunk enough that it barely fits after only a couple months. But that is not a negative against the shirt appeal at all. It is very cute.
Beautiful pursr
Large in hips
By far some of my favorite jeans have been bought off Amazon and these are definitely in the top five of my favorite jeans
Looks very nice and warm
"As other reviewers have said, this skirt is super sheer. The color is even prettier in person though! Perfect for spring and summer. I am going to wear it to work."
my package came sooner than I thought which was great it is a little big around the waist area but I love it
Didnt think it was real. it was real
Highly recommended as a long-lasting product. Surprised that a size 11 is a little tight to put on; always wore a 10-1/2. Feels OK after I get it on.
Fit just as expected.  Great for Halloween costume.
I bought this top to cover my midriff bulge and it works like a charm.  Plenty of pleated fabric to allow it to flow amazingly.  Heavy knit fabric that does not wrinkle easily.
"Great fitting, light weight shoe. Excellent choice for those with a wider foot."
"This robe is fine for the price.  It is soft enough and not too warm, which is what I wanted as I am always on the warm side.  I ordered the XL/XXL, and is comfortably roomy (I'm 6'0"", 230 lbs), so if you're kind of on the fat side like me, you should be good to point, but I'm not sure where that point is.  The sleeves are short, but I thought that was how this style of robe was supposed to be, so it doesn't bother me."
What band is a little scratchy but overall good.
"I ordered in a 2 and 4 and the 2 fit better. I am 5'3 and 125lbs. Its a very stretchy, nice material. I loved this dress but it ended up being a little too fancy for the event I was going to and I don't really need a gown for just anything so I returned it, but I really did love it and would have kept it if I had somewhere to go."
Bought this cause it looked great. Fits good only thing is that when you try hook it it keeps coming back out.
A bit small than expected.
"NIce, fits well."
Love it!! Soo cute
This is my 4th Eco Drive Citizen watch and by far the most special and beautiful. This was a gift from my husband. I had seen the plain stainless model at my local jewelers and like it but once I saw the 2 toned watch I fell in love with it. My patience paid off and we got this for an excellent price on Amazon and I love it. Beautiful and goes with everything! The picture does not do it justice. My only question is the water resistant feature....would it really be fine if I forgot to take it off for the shower or heaven forbid fall in a swimming pool.
This wedge looks Great !!!!!!!!!! on my feet.  It is not too high or too low.  You can wear it to dress up or dress down.  I love it
I wear them on my motorcycle and love them. well built  and dark  shipping was fast all good for the price 5 stars..
"I love, love these shoes! These cute unicorn shoes would have been worn to a wedding with other unicorn accessories however...
They are too narrow :(

I have another pair of shoes made by cute to core, size 11 which fit. I have a little room at the tip of my toes but they are quite narrow in the tow area which squishes my toes when I stand.

If they fit like the other pair, I would have kept them. So sad but, these have to go back.

Hope this helped my bigger/wider foot ladies!"
Really love the style. A little hard to put on in a hurry. Very cool and unique
"Great deal for the price. The belts appear to be relatively sturdy, as well as identical to a belt being sold on another website for nearly three times the price (just for one, not for two colors)! I have not experienced the issue of the belt popping off while being worn, but I also haven't worn it for an entire day yet."
So cozy! Love this brand.
Much needed for our Snowpacalypse here in Central Oregon. My feet stayed warm and dry through all the snow and icey rain.
Glad i ordered them!
"Really nice fabric, and true to color"
"I got these for my husband at Christmas, 2013.  He still wears them today.  They fit well and the inside padding is still soft.  They're not as plush inside as they were, but he wears these literally every single day for a minimum of 4-5 hours and he says they're still very comfortable.

Great shoes...hold up well."
fit as expected and look exactly as the picture shows.
I'm using it now really like it alot.
These are pretty but I wonder if they will be comfortable. They seem a little stiff.
"I like these boots also but they smell bad too,I keep them out side until I wear them."
"I have historically worn champion bras which serve their purpose.
I got this bra because it looks like a ""normal"" bra but is a more supportive.  I have not been disappointed!  It has all the support needed.  Has straps in the normal positions across the shoulders (no racer back).  The straps are wide, comfortable and adjustable."
"I was happy with the style, but unfortunately, they were somewhat large.  Its like they were extra wide and not the B medium width that I ordered.  If I wear them with thick socks, they work okay, but I wanted these for use in warm weather, so they didn't turn out to be the shoe of my dreams.  I did love the color and the suede feel though."
"The jeans are a great fit, nice stretch, roomy legs.  But there is more material between my knees & to the floor than the entire pair of pants. They are bell bottom-ish like.  I have to either go get them hemmed or either keep them folded to keep from dragging on the ground.  Plus I didn't know there were metal buttons on the back pockets. When you have a large booty, they tend to keep getting caught on things like doorways, chairs, car seats. But for the  most part, they fit, and I am happy."
"Just the right size for folded shirts, t-shirts and jeans. Along with small cubes for socks and underwear they make living out of a suitcase much more convenient than without."
"I love it, good price and fit. I plan on buying more."
"i could tell from the picture that it was going to be a bit more form fitting so i ordered a large. its a bit tight especially for a large, but thats ok because i am losing weight. the material is thick cotton with a bit of a stretch to it. i really like this shirt i need to get one in blue."
"I haven't really had the opportunity to wear them for any length of time. I tried them on when I received them and they are extremely comfortable. The memory foam forms to your foot, giving good support and comfort."
The price is right for the quality and size. I must point out that pictures tend to be a little misleading but all and all a good item for a person that normally carries just the necessary to travel. My rating is no bigger than 4 stars (I like it).
"The sterling Silver wheat chain description was GREAT! I wear it every day and have no problems with color change,perfect weight."
Fits true to size. I ordered up (medium) instead of small based on other reviews. Going to order another in a small. 5 foot 10 and 140 pounds.
NICE VEST.  GOOD FIT.
"These pants are good enough, but they have fairly shallow cargo pockets. Not much use there. I prefer their other pants."
Just in time for the holidays! A good way to dress up the layered outfit.
Durable and a great fit.
"So far so good!  I've never had any type of wallet, and after reading the reviews and as well as noticing the product itself looked very nice and looked of very good quality, I decided to give it a try.  One reason was to get the RFID benefit, due to upcoming travels, I felt I better protect my cards/ID better.
After having received it and using it for the past couple of weeks now I can say it has taken some getting used to.  I""ve always used a tri-fold type mostly throughout my life.
This Money clip type wallet definitely does not hold as much as my old billfolds, but it has allowed me to eliminate the unnecessary cards and crap that I used to carry around for basically no reason, other than ""it might come in handy some day"" reason.  Lame right.  Every man can realte I'm sure, right?
Getting used to it is coming along nicely, and the wallet is loosening up little by little as I use it daily.  The first several days I could barely get the cards back out from the two card slots on either side, but I do have them pretty much to capacity.  The product info indicates that each of the two slots holds up to six cards, which is about right, but like I said they are in there pretty tight, but slots are indeed loosening up as the real genuine leather gets broken in and sat on (in my pocket) and whatnot.
I love the look of the leather and I've already gotten a few compliments on it as well."
"Beautiful plugs and they came very quickly. I read other reviews that had suggested that it was hard to fit the plugs into some peoples' ears, but as long as your ears have been gauged for an adequate amount of time, there should be no problems."
just as advertised and top quality leather!!
Wonderful item Well built and solid. Keeps On Ticking! Very nice leather band. Will buy again and refer to friends and colleagues.
They're soft and comfortable. No complaints. My daughter likes them.
"I first saw these shoes in a store and was surprised to like them as much as I did. The picture does not show the true beauty of the irridescent color or the gold metallic heel. If you're on the fence, try them in person just to see! As for the fit, I did go a 1/2 size up from my normal shoe size (purchased a 9 normally wear a 8.5) because the strap across the toe felt too tight in the 8.5. It was well worth it though because I am in love with this shoe!"
"Love these, one of my favorite styles."
"I have other colors and love them, so comfortable."
"I'm 6'4"" and over 250 lbs and this is just a great comfortable shoe that is holding up well. I ordered the 12 2E and it fits just a bit large but is perfect for me as I use inserts (Sole Men's Softec Brown inserts). The leather is great quality and the break in period was minimal. I loved these so much I ordered a black pair, too."
Great product ordered another
It worked for us . It organizes the clothes when you want to carry one carry on for 2 people
These are very comfortable and I got them when they were on sale so I'm very pleased!
I love these shoes.  This is the first pair that I've owned and wish I had bought them sooner.  They are extremely light and easy to wear.  I love the fact that they can be sanitized.  Great shoe at a great price.
"Bought these for my honey for vday (very cute shoe for a mans man) .. they are just a touch big... big enough to maybe wear thick gym socks with.. I would suggest maybe a half size smaller than your actual shoe size, otherwise they will be flipping and flopping all over the place."
"Very pretty. I not only will wear it over my swimsuit but as a shirt with camisole underneath it as well. It's very sheer...but so pretty!
I did receive this item at a discount for my full and honest review."
traditional Carhart quality.
The color is awesome! So vibrant and Springy. Fits typically. Love the cuffed sleeve option.
I have flat feet and these have helped to alleviate all pain I had in my ankles and knees from it. Highly recommend!  I also own the orthoheel slippers because walking in wood floors barefoot is killer after time. I will be buying more orthoheel in the future.
My 6 year old boy loves these. So easy for him. Very durable and strong.  Exactly what I hoped for.
Space saving. Good for travel
I was unable to find fit flops in the style / size/ and color I wanted so I opted for this style.  I am so happy I did as I find this has the ultimate comfort in the footbed for me who has plantar fasciitis which is extremely painful in the heel area.  This fit flop is amazing and I'll order more in this style and hope it continues with no changes.
"These shoes are narrow. I had them stretched a bit. So now, I am wearing them in."
"My favorite cardigan. The color is beautiful, and exactly as shown. Lightweight and cool."
"This shirt was soft and flattering.
I'm 5'6"", 130 lbs., curvy and slender.
Size medium was just a tad bit big on me, but definitely not a deal breaker.
Holes in the sleeves are a little bit off, but nothing noticeable if this shirt isn't skin tight on you."
"Good brush, bristles are a bit soft and bent easily, but it did a nice job with the shoe polish paste I bought for my boots.  This works well for shining up the ends, but you will need a larger brush for the rest of the shoe."
Excellent buy I love the color
"I wear a size 32 and medium when it comes to shorts and this fit me without a problem. The material is slightly stretchy and feels good in and out of the water. The shorts have a velcro fly made up of small velcro circles, which is awesome, because a full velcro strip can give an awkward ""bulge"". The colors are vivid and bright, and the side zipper pocket is also a bonus. Great shorts overall."
"I bought this watch for my boyfriend for his 31st birthday and he loved it! I looked at so many watches and had to decide between this watch and the brown Kenneth Cole watch which is the same style. I ended up going to a department store so that I could see the watches in person. When I saw the two, I knew the Gunmetal was the one for my boyfriend.
This is a great quality watch and you can clearly see the inner working of the timepiece. It's sophisticated, masculine and exceptionally made!
This is a great gift for that guy who already has everything!!"
"Quality shoe.
I find I am putting these on all the time. Even around the house.
Packaged well, nice thick box, tissue wrapped,
... leather straps, so comfortable, soft, it really is a beautiful shoe. Well made, solid, good materials and workmanship... feels durable, like it will last a long time.

Very glad I ordered these.
Fit perfectly."
"This product is a very sturdy yet pliable vinyl material, it's definitely going to last a while but it's not the color I expected. I ordered the 'rose red' color and online it looks like a pinky/red color and it's very dark in person. Almost brown or maroon. The closest to red I would classify is oxblood and that's still too red for this color.

On the bright side it does have tons of pockets and as long as the color doesn't bleed on the inside o my bag if damp, I will be completely satisfied.

PROS: Pockets, very portable, easy to use and transport,offers a lot of space for little volume.

CONS: Color, netting feels very fragile."
My 9 yo son loves this hat. Great fit and excellent sun coverage. He looks like he's going on a safari.
Great Flip Flops. Very conformable
It's really nice to have these as extra in my bra drawer.
Part of our granddaughter's Christmas list and was well received.
Robe it a little too long for my height.
Just what I was looking for in an everyday jacket!
Very comfortable....the various colors match several of my scrubs! Good shoe choice.
Great shoes.  My daughter really likes them
Perfect fit!! Great shoe
"Thswi bracelet is so cute and has held up very well. I have worn it swimming, on the beach and in the ocean and it  still looks new. get this and not the gold tone."
I love the pendant. I was very pleased with the order. Came very fast and the pendant is lovely. Thank hyou
"Nice gems, overall happy with them.  Got a couple big ones, order from gem market a few times."
"These booties are well made & comfortable.  The width is perfect which I needed for a toe that likes to misbehave.  They look classy & neutral. The low heel & monk style can be worn with skirts, jeans, & casual dresses."
Nice little shoes for my little man.  I a little bit larger but he will grow into them.
bought for my daughter and she loves them.
"I've been looking for something like this since I lost my original septum retainer years ago. This product exceeded my expectations! Perfect size, length and looks just like the original! Would absolutely buy again :)"
This skirt is really cute. I like how it's structured and poofs out a little bit. I've seen this exact skirt in stores and on TV but it's much cheaper here and shipping was shorter than expected. It's a black and white striped short skirt that I've also seen in blue and black. I wear mine with a black long sleeve top and black t-strap heels.
"These are great for those of us who do not have the ""usual"" build. My hip and bottom are one size and my waist another size. If they fit my waist, the pants sag. If I my pants to fit my bottom, the waist is to small. This is just the way I am built. With just an extra inch with these extender, I can get pants that look good on me and are comfortable. This is not a 'just gained weight' thing. My BMI is 22 and has been that for years. These are worth a try for those that have the same problem as me."
my boy loved it
I am definitely a Sperry fan! These shoes make a great statement with everything I wear them with; I have received nothing but compliments on these shoes.
Cute shorts for Ace Venture costume and just to use after Halloween. :D
"I ordered these because I needed a nude sports-type bra to wear under my white show shirt for a horse show, and failed to find any in store. The price was right so I risked these and am very happy! I'm not big on top so don't need much support, so this type of bra is great for me - if you're bigger and need support, look elsewhere, I think. Very comfy!"
"Great bands with many  color  options.  Love having  different bands  to  pair with my timex weekender. Only complaint is that there aren't  even  more color  combinations.  I would love some burgundys,  aubergine. chocolate brown  options."
I wish the back was close or that the picture or description of the outfit says that the back is wide open
"I've been looking for a fun heel with Blue Patent for a while and this show jumped right out at me.  They were waiting on my doorstep when I got home from work and I ran in to try them on, perfect fit, and super cute.  They are reasonably priced, and I've had good luck with Pleaser shoes in the past so I'm a happy camper!"
I have a narrow foot and it hard to find a running shoe that fits snug and is comfortable. These shoes fit great and look amazing on. I spend lots of time on my feet and at the end of the day my feet do not hurt as they have with other shoes. Two thumbs up
Love the comfort and quality for the price of this product! Will definitely order more of this brand of flip flops..
"While there is some arch support, I would like a little more.

These shoes are so comfortable that I can and do wear them everyday.  They are lightweight, quiet, and comfortable all over my foot.  I'd like a pair in every color!"
This wig really made my costume complete. It was a bit of a fix to wear while driving the car. :)
"I was looking for a cycling cap and this was an expensive option to try one out.

Keep in mind it's very flimsy and made of a thin mesh. It's much thinner than what I've found in a cycling shop but I still love it. Keeps my head and helmet less sweaty and more comfortable during my rides. I have a huge head and it fit me perfectly.

A+ I recommend! Worth the low price."
"Got my normal size 9 I get in any other shoe, but I have a thicker calf and have had trouble finding a boot of this type to accommodate that.  With this boot I FINALLY found that!!  Legs slides in with ease & fits perfectly, not tight, fits just as it should & so comfortable on my feet.  I love the design too! "
"I ordered tan since it was the lightest color they had, other than white.  The tan was WAY too dark for the intended shoes.  Not worth the return shipping cost.  I will have to continue looking elsewhere for very thin dress shoelaces in beige or cream.  If anyone has any sources, I will be very happy to learn about them!

Update:  The company owner contacted me to see what he could do to make me happier.  He refunded my original purchase and sent me another set, free.  These new laces work beautifully!  They are not waxed, which is the style I prefer.  They are the right color for my shoes.  I was very impressed with the customer service.  They care that their customers are happy and are willing to go the extra mile for them!"
Great fit great comfort.  Little hard to get on.
"Functional wallet, holds my stuff. I thought I was getting a brown one though and got a black one. I decided I like the black one too."
Great jeans at a very reasonable price.
"Overall, the quality of this top was very high. I ordered a large and it fit loose enough to wear a couple base layers underneath if need be. I am 5 10,  150 lb. If I was looking for a snug tight fit, a medium would be appropriate. But if you intend to put a couple layers underneath, then you may want to size up.
It may seems thinner then you might expect, but it is extremely warm, and flexible enough to have good movement with little or no restraint. I believe you could easily wear this as an outer layer alone, as it is also very fashionable."
feet nicely on the body
"Exactly what I was hoping for and you can't beat the price! I ordered a large to be on the safe side (5'4"") - Usually a medium but I wanted to make sure this wasn't too snug based on the other reviews."
Bought (6/9) for my nephew who is a husky 3 month old they are perfect great quality shirts. He will get many wears out of them. The colors are great too I will definitely buy more in the future once my Lil one arrives
"Okay, let's get this out of the way - this backpack is expensive. I admit if this weren't available as a Vine item, I wouldn't pay so much for a backpack because I'm too frugal. But, if you're looking for a designer-label backpack for the masses, you're already prepared to pay a bit more for the item.

The bag is suitable for all genders. I can fit an older 15"" Macbook Pro circa 2009 with a non-SSD hard drive and a Super-Drive in the lightly padded laptop pocket, with the two corners touching the top of the bag without stretching the bag or struggling to stuff it in. I've already decided this bag is what I'll use to transport my old laptop.

The backpack is very classy and understated, which is how I prefer my products. The outer material feels very sturdy and uses thicker nylon fabric. The inside is lined, unlike many cheaper backpacks. The zippers slide smoothly. The zipper pulls are big for easy zippering. The bottom panel has something stiff inside for support, giving this a bit more structured look. The slightly rounded boxy look also uses space more efficiently.

I like that the bag doesn't have a dozen compartments. It doesn't have a special panel for headphone wires, pen holders and other tiny pockets. Besides the laptop pocket, the main compartment has two additional pockets and a zippered compartment, along with the zippered outer compartment. However, I do wish this had a water bottle holder, though I admit adding one would take away from its simple, refined look.

This has a bit of that premium feel than the book bags I'm used to. The black color gives this an elegant look. It's a very nice bag without screaming, ""I'm expensive - steal me."""
"Cute funny pants, a little thin but they are cheap."
I bought this for a friend for Christmas last year.  She says it is incredibly warm and not a bit scratchy.  It is pretty special.
love them! where em everywhere!
My husband washed it few times and the black didn't fade just yet. Size was rather small? It did shrink up a bit in the washer. Size up!
Good quality. . Boyfriend  loves it
Too large to tie your hair up but excellent satiny fabric.
"i love them and my 2 year old loves them! Very comfortable, she can even put them her self.
the only reason i list 4 star is because her legs get so dirty in them (like she is walking barefoot)  so i actually use socks with them."
"Looked for these all over, one of the best uniform shirts I have found,  When you order get  a size smaller than you buy at the
cheap mall stores. Length was great and the neck when buttoned doesn't choke you. I am 5'9"" 175 lbs and waist 34"".  The medium fit
very well. If you wear a vest on duty you will need a large. I like the front zippered pockets."
Arrived ontime & fit 8-9yr old boys perfect
Great waterproof shoe. I've used it in the rain and it kept my feet dry.
"This costume is adorable. A bit thin so you may want to put tights underneath to keep your child warm if fall is chilly for you like it how it is for us in the midwest. While I like the costume the product description is misleading. I purchased this costume b/c I liked it and the product DESCRIPTION (not the product features) claims that the boot covers are included. This is not the case. Everything is included EXCEPT boot covers. I'm a bit disappointed because I like the complete ""look"" of a costume."
Very nice.. fits true to size.
"I got the XL because Im pregnant with hopes that it stretches and it is actually perfect. It fits tight around my belly. But when i lose some of this baby weight it should fit somewhat loose. The fabric is light which could be considered ""cheap"" but the top was very low cost so it is worth what you pay. I will probably get some more in different colors."
Cute design. Has shoulder buttons for big-headed babies.
"have to admit was very surprised with the quality and fit and colour of this Jacket. sort of expected it to be no good because of the price, but love it, everything was as described, love it love it."
"I read other reviews and I was scared because I thought I would not be perfect but I stay and not tight! is a size M and I feel comfortable with it, it is also true to the photo image."
"Love this ring!!! My original ring is an antique that I don't like to wear all the time so bought this as a spare.
Great fit, gorgeous sparkle and looks real"
"I got another brand at the same time as I got this one only because there was only one in stock, and I wanted two, so I got another brand.  I prefer the fit and feel of this one over the other, but they are both good."
"I love my Reeboks... have been wearing them for the past several years, specifically for running. I would recommend Reebok Zigtech for any runner. Great shoes!"
Warm and comfy. Great pack to have.
Good piece. Glad I bought it.
"It came on time. It looked like my hair as well. I need to take pictures and upload them, which I may do later. Worth the price but sheds a lot when you brush it."
"ordered these twice in a 8.5/9 and received a 6.5/7 both times, the card board holder stated the right size and the shoe showed the smaller size which it was, however this was only in the white.  I ordered another color and it was perfect, 5 stars."
"Love them!  Super soft, stretchy, comfy."
Best socks for business casual... great bang for the buck... Not my first purchase of these and not my last...
"levis is always my choice, and this one is not that good, waist is alright, but to tight for legs, the reason I put it five stars is I looks good on it,"
"Great Fit, Roomy, and a great length."
"As a large cup, smaller gal, I had one heck of a time finding a nursing/sleep bra with my first child.  I just made do with regular bras and ended up nursing only a short while.  I am not pregnant w/ my 2nd with just a little more time to go.  This bra will serve me very well as a sleep bra now and then as a sleep and nursing bra (even though the cups don't open up, the wrap front will be almost as good) after baby is here.

Size seems to be spot on.  I am a 34 F right now, so the cups are slightly big, but once I have the baby and the milk comes, I'm sure the F/G size will be perfect."
LOVE THESE & FINALLY THE PRICE WAS RIGHT. I SIMPLY REFUSE TO PAY MORE THAN I THINK A PRODUCT IS WORTH.
"O. M. G. I can honestly say I have never worn more comfortable underwear in my life.

I don't like to spend a lot of money on underwear, and my standard has for several years been off-the-shelf multipacks of Hanes or FotL. But they stretch and sag over the course of a day. When retail outlets stopped carrying single-color packs of them (I don't care for dark-colored underwear, and the mixed-color multipacks always have a dark color in them, usually black), I decided it was finally time to look at something a bit higher up the ladder.

I found these here on Prime Day 2017, when they were roughly half their usual price. The reviews were overwhelmingly positive, so I decided to splurge and buy four packs while they were on sale. I figured I'd open just one pack, and if I didn't like them, I'd just return the other three. (I'm not crass enough to try to return underwear that's been worn, even if it was for less than a minute.)

Needless to say, I won't be returning them. Thanks to the spandex content, they don't sag at all after a full day's wearing. The material is incredibly soft and comfortable, so much so that I now wonder how I put up with the coarser material of the mass-market stuff. They don't appear to have suffered any significant effects from washing. Some reviews have complained about the sewn-in logo tag, but I haven't had any issue with it. They are, quite simply, awesome. I will be buying more at the regular price (which is still lower per pair than many of the higher-end brands), and will continue to buy these as long as they are available (assuming the quality remains the same).

As for the eco-friendly marketing, well, I'm too cynical to believe that any of it is true just because they say it. I'm not saying I think they're lying, but most companies that tout the ""green-ness"" of their products are at minimum exaggerating. So my recommendation doesn't take that into account, either pro or con. I recommend these based solely on the quality of the product I gotand that quality makes them worth every cent of the price."
This bra is very comfortable and great fitting.  I am very satisfied with my purchase.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a comfortable everyday bra.
Fits well; looks super cute.
"I don't usually buy shoes sight unseen, but this choice turned out just fine.  I find the fit and comfort to be in line with the  price.  Would I buy them again?  Yes I would."
"I am a guy and I love these panties! Cute, comfy! Will buy more!"
I wear these all the time. They're the epitome of a perfect moto boot.
"Update: our son STILL loves this, 18+ months later. Its pretty snug on him now but he still sleeps in it, plays the grizzly when our boys play hunting. I would do this every year if I could.

We got this for our five year old son for Halloween, he wore it the week leading up to Halloween, and has worn it around the house and as pj's multiple times since. I bought it a little big anticipating that he would be able to wear it for a while. He's a lover of all things cozy and soft. The jammie's themselves seem to be well made and don't fuzz all over everything in the wash. Overall, it was a good buy. I would do it again."
"I thought I'd look like a granny in this thing, but didn't care because I don't want sun on my face - but I look like an actress from the audrey hepburn era in it - LOVE IT.  and I love the way it un-does with velcro so I can hang it on beach bag handles, hooks, etc - I can't do that with my straw visor."
The mom thought these were very cute.
These are soft slippers with a slightly fleecy interior. Nice for warmer days when you need just a bit of warmth but nothing too heavy. They have tiny nubs on the bottom to keep from slipping. Work well on my hard wood floors.
I love the shoes and they are super comfy! The only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 is that they are a bit more squishy than I expected.
"The engraving is well done, right to specifications. The chain and clasp are good. Wish chain length would come in more choices. I was surprised at feel of pendant. I thought it would feel more like a coin. It's very light and feels like an aluminum tab of a soda can. Wish it were a little weightier."
This a beautiful romper great material this is a must buy.
Love it but I am tie dye grandma
"This was too big and a little frumpy on me. I didn't like the material, it was really thick and stretchy.. again, felt really frumpy."
This watch is in amazing condition and arrived nice and quick! Definitely love this product! This watch was actually for a gift but I may be borrowing it!
"These fit very well and are the perfect length for me - a shorty.  I love the new jean dark color and they are a little stretchy, providing even more comfort"
Very nice t shirts for the money.
"Elegant shirt, good quality item."
Beautiful! I also got the matching necklace and they really look like real diamonds! Stunning!
"super strong magnet, does not demagnetize my credit cards or hotel room key so absolutely worth it"
"Lovely, lightweight scarf with vibrant colors. Was a little bulkier than I'd like but am happy with it"
"My husband has been searching for banded collar shirts for some time.  We have ordered more after receiving the first one.  My only comment is that I would have preferred exposed buttons and oxford cloth.  But at the price, these are a bargain indeed."
Great quality and desing
Soft shoes. But the upper is a little bit low
Very warm and fashionable for an easy outdoor look
These are very nice boots. We have had them a couple months and they seem to be holding up well to my rough 8 year old. I love the design of the boot and that they can be dressed down and worn with a tee shirt or dressed up and worn with nice button up shirts. My little boy is flat footed so we added some arch supports and they fit him well. He wears them almost everyday and says they are very comfortable.
Most of the time I have problems with pants being to baggy in the legs and seat.  These fit great.  Much better than I expected.  I ordered them an inch larger in the waist than I usually do because I normally ware a 33x32 which they did not have.  The 34 are not too big.
This was another deal of the day sale item and was priced at about half of what they were selling it for at Macy's. Really prettier once you get to see it. My daughter said they were really comfortable but so are most Aerosoles.
Reliable Slack.
This was my second pair of Merrel's These look better with jeans.
It's very stylish. I'm a 5'3 and weight 125 lb. I don't like clothing to tight nor too baggy. The small size was perfect fit. Enough pockets and light weight coat. So far I'm loving it!
gave one to bff
Got this for my mother for mother's day and she loved it!! She loved the color and the design. I think it was a perfect gift for mothers day but if you were to get this for your wife or SO they would love it too. The crystals make it look even better and very elegant. The watch does not look cheap and the materials feel like its good quality. Very happy that my mother loved her gift.
"Love these, am obsessed and wear them all the time."
These were great. Worked well for dance class when we do turns across the floor. I have foot problems so dancing bare foot can be a problem for me.
I purchased this for my granddaughter she is she just turned one and this fit her with a little room for warmer clothes on the inside it looks so cute on and is well made 
Nice material- beautifully made. Good quality.
True to size and super cute.
Comfy and fair price so far still new though...
"This blazer its beautiful, I buy in size 40/L, this is the size of I used, but i have a small problem with the size in the sleeves, because... Apparently the back that connects to the arm is a little small for when I move my arms. But, despite this I will use. Its quality is very good, is a blazer lined and elegant for any commitment."
For a baby I felt these fit the best compared to any other brand.
"The material is breathable, the bra seems like it is good quality. I don't think the plastic clips will break or be a problem in the future. It is very comfortable as well. My only complaint would be that the back section where the clasps are is a little bit hard and itchy if you use the last notch, it can be irritating but I've gotten use to it."
"I am VERY happy with these shorts, i could not find them at any local store and at that price. Keep it up Amazon."
"Ok, here we go. I have been dying to do this review... I have a ring that is size 7. I have a ring finger that is a size 6-6.5 and a middle finger that is a 7.5. I need to up the size of the ring or reduce it but either way it doesn't fit. $30 to enlarge (or reduce) it professionally by resizing or $15 to reduce it with ""plastic"". Interesting concept so I figured... what have I got to lose. I have other rings that are 1/2 sizes to big also.

Well, I got the product and read the directions carefully. I bent the hanging hook up and anchored the card under a heavy book for extra stability. I opened the can and peeled back the film and looked at the contents. Relatively clear and sticky... hmm, ok. I took the ring but the face in my thumb and middle finger and dipped about 1/2 way in and sort of scooped it forward. I got a good glob on the inside and coated the outside. I checked to make sure the edges were covered and hung it on the hook. Now here is where I think people get into trouble. I left it alone for 2 days. When I got home from my weekend vacation I looked at it and it seemed flat inside. No glob at all. It had settled into a well. I put the ring on and felt the texture of the the product. It has a certain kind of rubbery texture that seems to give it some gripping power. Still, it is a little big so I dipped it again. Instructions say you can so here we go again. I followed the same procedure and waited 24hours. I put the ring on this morning and it isn't tight and has that rubbery gripping power and is kind of comfortable. I can dip it again but I am happy right here.

Now, you don't want to go rubbing on the edges because they will come up and will be rubbery ( I think the name of ""plastic"" they use is a bit of a misnomer) If you wash your hands, the ring will feel a little slick. Just take the ring off and dry your hands well and put it back on- no problem. I think this might last for a bunch of wearings. I don't intend to wear it every day. This is just a right hand ring anyway. I have lots of them. I have included pictures so you can see what this stuff looks like. You can see that there is no mess on the front of the ring. You can also see that if rubbed it will peel up a bit but I think in a few weeks after wearing it a few times I will just redip or peel the current coat off and redo the application. I hope you like this product. I think it is kind of handy. I don't like the metal clips you can install in your ring because they can come loose and scratch you and the plastic round things have a habit of falling out when I take the ring off or the ring slides in a circle on my finger. I hope this helps some of the unhappy people too. Try it again and see if it works better."
"Great, love the chain and can take if from casual to dressy, can't wait to use it for my outings!!"
"Looks great & I really liked this purchase, but the cross & chain are CONSTANTLY turning, leaving the cross behind my neck...ugh! And the chain doesn't not move freely through the cross...ugh!"
"very cute but post bend easily, be careful. for price i would get again. screw backs great so not pulled out."
Great for how cheap they are
"I'll say this is one of the better sports bras that I have bought, but not by much.  If I was to do it over again, I would look for a cheaper alternative simply because this one was so expensive.  I think you could find something of similar quality for a better price.

I think part of my disappointment was that so many reviewers mentioned how there was no bounce at all when they wore this bra, even for larger chested gals.  I did not find this to be the case at all (maybe they were doing lower impact exercise?), but then again, I found ""no bounce"" to be hard claim to believe in the first place.

Was it all I had hoped it would be?  No.  But did it cut down on at least some bounce compared to the standard ""pull over your head"" sports bra?  Yes."
"Great pants, if you remove promptly from the dryer and hang, zero wrinkles! They do run a size small in the waist."
Does have a latex smell but its bearable. Fit snug as it should. Got it a size larger because I am post partum. Sucks it all in as it should. After loosing weight I will buy the next size down
"Beautiful dress! Top part can be itchy but it looks gorgeous and sexy without being out of line.
Got the raspberry color as well.
Cannot wait to wear it!"
"Comfortable. I thought they would be too hot, but they are rather breathable. Did not have to constantly pull up or readjust. Surprised me how comfortable they are. Cute patterns...only I recommend sizing up!"
I love my cute little bag! Perfect
need more padding in bottom of shoe
I'm 5'4 150lbs. 12 p fit perfectly
This a great replacement once you size it to your rist beats the rubber strap on the luminox watch
Love carters clothes for kids! Our daughter has 2 twin boys and they are long. Some onsies are not long enough in the trunk area and do not fit properly. We have been using Carters from there birth! We also love the stretchable material and quality of the product
"I couldn't be happier with my slippers.  They are soft, warm and very comfortable.  I especially love the fact that there is no ridge on the back of the slipper, so if they do slip a little I'm not stepping on a hard edge."
Awesome Boots!!!! Great in weather and soothing comfort!!
"I've had these earrings a few months, I wear them a lot, they are cute, not heavy and the closures are fantastic! I can sleep in these without them falling out and getting lost. I also think their classy..... Glad I bought these!!"
Love this skirt... fits great and looks nice all day long.
Gorgeous classic watch!! I'm a woman who likes a bigger watch and this piece fits the bill!
"I wear ASICS trainers at work (color:  black).  I chose pink Cross-Trainers for my days off.  They are somewhat more expensive than Puma in the similar style, but ASICS fit better and have better sole support.  ASICS are always worth it due to the fact that I have a bunion.  The toe box fits well."
"The bottom wrinkles relatively easily, but it is lovely on and washes fairly well. My tall three-year-old fits into a size 5 perfectly!"
"I bought this ring to wear during trips so I could leave my wedding set in a secure place.  I had previously been using a titanium band, but it became scratched and dull after 2 trips.  After reading up on tungsten, I decided to buy this ring.  I *love* this ring.  The weight reminds me of platinum.  It is a domed ring,approximately 1mm thick, but I don't mind that. I find it to be very comfortable to wear.  I normally wear 3 bands on my ring finger and the 6mm width is perfect for me, as I've developed a permanent indent from my wedding set.  If your finger widens below the knuckle, this may rub a bit against your other fingers--but with Amazon's free returns policy on it give it a try.  I knew going in that the color would be gunmetal gray, which I find lovely--if you're looking for a silver-toned ring (i.e. silver/platinum/white gold appearance), this isn't for you. The shine on the ring is incredible and I'll be interested to see if it truly holds up.  After seeing it, my husband said ""maybe I should get one too!""--and he isn't a jewelry person at all--so that's a ringing endorsement from him."
Grandson loves that he can Velcro them himself.
Love it more than I expect it fits all my stuff and even my iPhone 6s Plus in the zipper part plenty of room for a lot of cards and it's a great quality i highly recommend this wallet
I really like the fit a these jeans.  I am an over 60 body that likes these skinny jeans so hard to find this type jean that fits my body type.  These get it do e
"great for the price. cheap, obviously synthetic hair, but it is great for a costume"
"Fit perfect, tight enough I can use my fingers, very warm and I live in Wisconsin."
Purchased for son he said it works great.
"Exactly what I was looking for, I like the extra length so you don't constantly have to pull it down"
"These are very comfortable, although the lace band at top is slightly smaller than in previous years. The seam down the middle in back gives the slight definition I prefer for this panty."
"Fits, cute style. Only bummer is the width is a bit tight. I have slight bunions so it does become a bit painful. Hoping it will loosen up awith some wear"
Cute and have held up. Ive had them for about 6 months. Slightly big in the foot. Good buy for the price.
I love this vest!  Fits
"adorable! perfect kids halloween costume. fit my 6 year old perfectly and lasted through multiple halloween parties, trick or treating and costume day at school"
No complaints! Have worn and washed several times. Fits wonderfully. 100pounds and ordered a small.
bonitp
Great pair of boots.  Comfortable too.
I wear this bracelet almost every day. I think it's incredibly stylish and my family immediately noticed it when I went home to see them recently. Its great for such a cheap price but I do wish it was a bit more sturdy. I worry that someday I'm going to end up accidentally breaking it by over-extending the elastic.
These are the perfect size for my 3 year old little girl - not too big and not too small!  Great colors and pleased with the overall quality!  Good Value!
"This is a great bra! It's comfortable, smooth under clothes and doesn't cause 'bulges'. I've bought several in different colors. They wash well and they're pretty."
Daughter said they're comfortable. She wears them often.
I knew this shoe would be perfect for me.  I was not disappointed.  It feels great. I would recommend it highly.
Thanks very nice product
"Durable and fun and lively for our kindergarten boy. He loves it. His classmates admire it.  Many pockets!  Fits lunch box and folder; mittens and hat; snacks, holds a water bottle and even has a pocket that fit his Crocs now that is winter here in Michigan.  I see this backpack lasting a few years!"
As described.  My 5 year old got the largest size due to complaints the costume runs small....costume runs true to advertised unless a large child is in the pic.
You can not go wrong with this technology
Super cute and fun for a pull over!
Very stylish. I get some soooo many compliments when I wear these. Comfortable and fit so cute!
Good quality fabric. Cute grey sweater. Fits as expected
Fits well but the nose opening seems to not line up quite right. My son likes it but the mask part is just hard to get on just right.
"Excellent quality, highly comfortable at an outstanding price."
My brother like it very much . The leather is  so soft and the wallet look very nice !
Fifth time I have purchased this bag. (I have one in every color available.) It is perfect for my needs.
"Super cute and comfy!
I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for a fair and honest review."
Better than expected.  Each pair came individually packaged.
"I love the color. my only complaint is, I'm a 5'6 and the top feels a little on the short side. but fits well in every other way."
I have always loved overalls- these run a little on the large side so even  if you think you want them a little bigger order your normal size. The only thing I'm not crazy about is the weird flat clasps- I'm not sure they will hold up long.
This is a very glamorous glittery belt and the width is just perfect and fits through my Lee jean's loops. I bought it in black and will now buy it in tan or blue. I wear a size 12 in jeans and ordered the large size in this belt.
"Thank you Sketchers, once again. My son (who is 14) has size 16 wide feet and these are the only shoes that fit and that are affordable!!"
 These shoes.  Didn't fall once!  Comfy comfy!
"I had purchased the set with 3 different sizes and this set.  I didn't need 3 large cubes, I will be returning this set. They are great for packing jeans and large items. I guess I'm not taking as many as I thought on our upcoming trip!"
"These are really great underwear. A little more money than cheaper ones but these are the best fitting, comfortable, best construction and can hold up after washing many times."
"A bit thin, but good otherwise."
Wife will write this review.  The fabric is soft to the touch.  It is TTS.  It looks very nice on.  It covers all the areas you want covered.  You will not be disappointed if your order it.
Its a great lightweight jacket
ITEMS RECEIVED ON TIME.  VERY PRETTY.
Very Nice and good quality fabric size is correct
"They fit, they last and they're much cheaper here on Amazon."
love this belt!! Perfect!
Went up a size to have perfect fit. Medium weight material. Nice t- shirt.
"Nice fitting slipper, warm an cozy for winter. I like these slippers and they can be worn outside if you so desire because of solid sole."
I love these because they are very thin for the summer but the quality wasn't  lacking
"Needed to get adjusted with my massage sandals when I first got them, but kids don't seem to have a problem
at all. All my grandkids own a pair, they love the sandals
Had to change a couple, one was wrong color and the other a Big Kid vs men's although same size, was slightly different"
"I love this top because of the way it feels, soft like good quality almost like a sweater. Ordered a small and fit perfect just like the picture! I have both colors but wish there were more because I'd buy all!"
"I love these Grandco slippers. I bought them first about 8 years ago, and since then have always had one. They are comfortable, nice looking, casual and water proof. They make a bold statement. I just love them! Now I have two of them.."
"I WORKED AT THE AIRPORT AND WAS ON MY FEET RUNNING AROUND FROM 8-10 HOURS A DAY.  MY FEET NEVER HURT, NEVER GOT SWOLLEN AND I NEVER GOT IN TROUBLE CAUSE THEY LOOK CUTE LIKE SHOES NOT SNEAKERS.  ABSOLUTELY GREAT SHOE"
"Great quality and it looks great. Unfortunately it was a little small for me, but Im hoping it will fit better once I lose some weight! Perfect for Comic Con!"
Beautiful..love it
Great quality shirt.  Fits perfect.
"Love these boots!  This is my tenth pair. Only issue I have ever had is the fabric on heal always wears out way before the boot. Never causes any problems but I still don't like it. Duct tape fixes all the issues. I have never found a boot that lasts like this with great comfort. Except military boots, but you can't get military boots with steel toe."
I was surprise with the material of this blouse its very nice material it fits perfectly on my size 16 its really really nice blouse.
"I added my own insert so I am not sure on the arch support, but I recently became a server and these are great for being on my feet all day and for being non skid. They don't fit as well as I would like after adding my own insert but I haven't tried them without. My insert makes the opening a little narrow while I have a ton of extra room in the toes. All and all a great rubber shoe.

UPDATE: I bought a second pair because the slip resistant part of the shoe came off. It seems it was added afterwards and is not part of the shoe itself. But they are so comfortable I had to have another pair!!"
Very comfortable would have likened it a bit longer. But no complaints
I bought these in yellow for my daughters Halloween costume. They looked great. She was comfy. I'm sure that's the only time she'll ever wear them. They worked out great for what I needed them for.
"All is good, great price."
Very comfortable and fashionable. I wear these with jeans and to work.
"Bought these for my better half, since every store we went to didn't have her size or the color she wanted."
This bead is really beautiful and goes perfectly with my DaVinci Easter egg charm!
LOTS of compliments and figure flattering.
"These flip flops are great. I ordered two pair I full size up as I was told they run small, I could have just gone up 1/2 size but they still fit wonderfully"
"I simply love these slippers.  So much so I want to get another pair.  Our old house is cold, and  the kitchen floor being over an uninsulated crawl space can feel as cold as an outside pavement.  These slippers have a thick padding that keeps my feet toasty warm.  And with the hard sole they can be used for running to the mailbox or garage or even to the grocery story. These slippers are so warm that my feet actually can get sweaty in them."
"Got this for my daughter, she loves it and so does my husband! It is cute!"
Allow for one size shrinkage as always.
Great mittens for keeping little hands warm and dry!!
"Material is on the thinner side, work well for a cooler (but not cold) fall day."
Great size for what you need to take when boarding and off boarding
Thought these were good socks until I bought some from Carhartt.
"I've grown into a huge fan of saxx underwear recently. These in particular fit just right in the waist but are just slightly loose in the thighs. I am 5'5"" 150 with 23"" thighs and a 29-30"" waist.the material is super comfortable and feel like it will last. I love the pouch that saxx has. Every underwear company needs to adopt this!"
I still wear it though.
"My boyfriend wears normal cloth Tabi's all the time. He ninja trains with his class and brothers every week. I thought this would make a perfect gift, since these are a little more heavy duty, and he is absolutely in love with them and wears nothing but these wherever he goes. He thinks they are great."
Nice and roomy to wear with thick socks
Great support. Very comfortable.
well made very nice
"Since tees with pockets are hard to find, I'm very pleased with these.  They fit well and also wash well."
I love these scarfs! I have bought three and they're all amazing!
The are so beautiful and make my daughter look beautiful too without bothering her. Great price and great quality.
"Very light, I can actually run in these if I needed to.  My foot is a little wide so TopModa shoes are too narrow for me.  Forever Adriana shoes have the perfect amount of room for me.  I actually bought a second pair when my first pair was destroyed in a series of unfortunate events, and I love my second pair even more."
"I have some J&M light tan shoes.  The laces had worn out and I had viisited five stores looking for replacements. I found none in the right color, just browns and blacks.  I guess that the shoes are old, but they are J&Ms and those last forever.  This site had a large variety of colors and unwaxed ones, too.  The waxed ones like to come untied too easily.  I am perfectly satisfied."
"I haven't used it much, and so I can't speak for its durability, but it's cute and cheerful when the weather's dreary."
"These are wonderful socks.  I live in Florida where it's always hot and humid.  These don't make my feet sweat (which is a real plus).  They have good padding where you need it, but the sock wicks away moisture, so my feet stay comfortable.  I have purchased several pairs of these socks and highly recommend them."
I'm actually a very fit person but I'm having a little problem with some small love-handles. With this insta slim they go away instantly. one thing to keep in mind; it fits very very tight so please remember to order a size or two larger than normal. I'm a big guy very muscular and fit; I usually order a extra large but this time after reading others reviews I order XXXL and it fit me perfectly.
"I expected to run like the Six Million Dollar Man, but have settled for the actual ability of a Six Dollar Man.  I have come to like the Hoka brand over time and distance mileage.  The dogs do not bark near as much with long run days (15 miles plus)."
"Super cute, although fits small, I will have to give it to my sister"
Very pretty looks just like picture already have had many compliments...only thing was top jewel was uneven but was worth price and would buy other colors
"Definitely a good buy at the price, but (and maybe it's just me) the fit seems a bit strange.  A bit tighter around the waist than other jeans/shorts I've purchased with the same waist size, but slightly baggy, um, around the zipper."
It's exactly as it looks in photos and described. I bought it as a birthday present from my younger brother and he loved it.
Love these...will definitely be getting more of them.
"Runs small in the band, cups are perfect."
This is my 3rd pair of the Hayla sandals; they are my favorites.  From the moment I put them on to the end if a long day - they feel great!  I highly recommend them.
The set is simple and stunning and the color just as pictured. Very pretty
Looks Great! Fits Great!
The little one loves them.  Thank you.
I bought this for my husband and he loved it! It fit just right and stayed in place after getting wet. Would highly recommend!
It's shurank as I expected and fit to me.
"I just received this 30 minutes ago, but my first impression is that it's a better deal at a higher quality than I expected. The face is large enough that I can read it w/o my glasses. It looks and feels sturdy. The battery model, as another reviewer mentioned, is stamped on the back of the watch, and a similar feature is that the band's width--24mm--is written on the band. Finally, most cheap watches have soft faces, meaning they scratch up in no time; this one is said to have a harder face. Now, if only the battery will last a few years...

update: months have past. the watch keeps time to about 15 seconds/month. as clumsy and as active as i am, the watches' face could easily be scratched beyond usability, and yet there isn't a scratch visible. i wear the watch 24/7, meaning in the rain and in the shower, and not only is the mechanism well-sealed, but the watch band still looks new."
Great way to extend the time I can wear flip flops. These are very thin which is what I wanted.
"Dress is excellent.  Actually it is gorgeous!

Material is more than light and soft.  Looks like better than what is in the photo!

I strongly recommending purchasing this dress or any other from Ever Pretty."
"I order 1/2 size larger and it fit me as expected.
The shoes is good quality for the price that i paid.  Real wool, real leather and comfy.
It is good for LA weather during winter but I have not tried in the snow area.
The picture look darker than the actual shoes, so little bit dissapointed.  I will give five star if the color as shown on photos."
"Was looking for a gym bag that is not too big and this Adidas bag is perfect. You can fit gloves, change of clothes, toiletry and still have room for a pair of sneakers. Very happy with this."
I love these shoes.  they are my 4th or 5th pair.  I wear them year round.
"Super cute shoes and a great price! I've gotten so many compliments on them. I bought my size and they do seem to run a little big length wise, but great for wide feet."
"I love it because the price and the quality of the Hanes Men's Classics 6 Pack V-Neck Tee, White, Large"
Bali never disappoints and I am very happy with this bra.
This product is awesome. Lightweight fabric and tasteful in all occasions an very fashion very good for all clothes .
"It is like wearing well ventilated shoes! These sandals are my go to foot wear all summer; whether going to the beach, going to the store or going to dinner."
Its great best product its worth more than hundred dollars I loved its stylish looks great sunglasses.
"Bought this shirt for my husband and he loves it.  He wears it all the time.  He says its warm and very comfortable.  Stains come out very nicely and it washes great, no shrinkage or color bleeding.  It has been washed numerous times and still looks brand new."
"Good quality, very comfy and good looking."
"I am a skinny, small framed, small breasted female. i got the small hoping it was small enough and it was!! And it squishes everything  I need it to to the place I need it most and looks great!!"
This suit fits great. Covers up my trouble areas and looks really nice. The price is great.
"Fantastic shipping, I was really happy to get it quickly. However, the silicon packet broke open inside the suitcase and was not a pleasant birthday suprise. The case looks nice and I hope it lasts awhile"
very cute. just like picture.
"Great for hiking and camping,  dries quickly, comfortable.

Columbia Boy's identifying the pant is the link.  Click on it"
"Such a pretty ring.  Fits perfect, the size is exact!  I love it."
"I love this! I ordered it to wear during Pride and it was amazing!!!! Fit absolutely perfectly and had a great flair to it. I got SO many compliments! Will def order again. I'm 135lbs and 5'6"" with a very tiny waist and huge hips, it was fantastic!"
Fits me well.  Happy with it.
I was surprised when I first got the jacket because it was a 3x and I order a 0X. Then I realized it was made in Korean and that is probably the Korean size chart. But it fit perfectly.
Is a gift anyways but the material is nice
"I think this shirt is perfect. I have a business casual job, so I'm able to wear it with slacks or jeans. I'm 5'1'' and 130lbs and I bought a small. I think it looks a bit more shapely on me than in the pictures.

One of my favorites. Highly recommended. The material is thin, like all of Allegra K's shirts, but a simple tank underneath is an easy fix."
"Very, very pretty. Figure-flattering. Soft material. One of my favorites."
Looks good. Seems solidly built. Let time tell...
This belt is very high quality both elastic and buckle. I wasn't expecting such a great belt at this price so will certainly buy more in other colors.
"Best tutu croniline skirt of them all. Does run small. I have a 34"" waist and a Medium fit perfectly. Gives a nice ""poof"" to any swing skirt!!!"
"Solid, good finish and no obvious flaws. The bracelet is better quality than I had expected. Not sure this is beatable for the money if its the size you want."
"This mask is surprisingly well made with some heft to it and the light up eyes and talking Spidey voice make it a lot of fun for the Grandkid.  He was running around for hours and sticking his face in every adult's he could find.  I wouldn't give it much for educational value, but that's not the point, the point is the kid can put it on his face and immerse himself for however long in 'being' Spidey!!  That's what it was all about when I was a kid and we'd get a cloth mask and a broomstick and Dad's hat and spend hours as The Lone Ranger! What Fun!  The fact that they took the time to make it right (sturdy and not flimsy) with replaceable double A batteries that can be exchanged easily speaks well of Marvel's licensing guys.  It'll last awhile and probably get passed on.  Say that about new toys today!"
Cool outfit I love it!
"It arrived quickly and nicely packaged, I don't think the picture did it justice it looks so much prettier in real life! I ordered my usual size and it fits good."
"Like 'em - they fit like normal shorts...not too darn short.
It's hard to find just normal shorts these days. Thanks!"
These are the most comfortable and practical dress sandal that I have had during my adult life.
Awesome socks don't ride down and be in shoes
"I really like this sports bra.  I love the front open/close zipper.  The zipper makes putting this bra on and taking it off quick and easy.  I do with there was an actual zipper locking mechanism but for the most part the zipper stays where it is supposed to.  The bra is comfortable to wear for several hours at a time.

Overall, it's really nice sports bra and I recommend it wholeheartedly!"
"They are very nice pants. I measured my inseam and decided to go with the smallest, I don't know how to say that correctly, but they ride up on me while the pant legs are too long and drag on the floor. I'm no seamstress so I'm in a quandary as to what to do.

Again, I really like the pants. They could be worn to a nice event, if you were comfortable doing that. Mine just don't fit right."
Came early. Love the material and fits perfect. I think I got a medium and fits good. Alittle shirt but that's a-okay!
Love the shoe. Very well made. It does run small. My daughter wears a 4 in all her shoes but this type she would have needed a 5.
Could have been a little wider to fit a bigger man and the fabric isn't as soft as hoped but overall it was nice. Husband liked it a lot.
Absolutely beautiful! Very pleased with the quality and the ample size. The price was also a great point!
Fits my wide foot perfectly
"little small buy size up, two sizes if going to wear hooded sweatshirt under"
These are super fun! They come right to the knee and have a nice opening in the back!
Absolutely beautiful cross! Had to put a new chain on it to match the beautiful cross! Recommend this cross to anybody! Please purchase it is beautiful!
"Had this pair for a few months now. I'm a 5 and half. The those are true to size, beautiful and durable. Only problem is I'm used to light shoes. Those took me a while to adjust. If I'm not wearing it for a whole day it's fine."
"Reviewed by my wife: I have several Dermablend products: the ""CoverCreme"" in several colors; the ""Liquid Camo Medium Coverage Foundation""; the ""INTENSE PowderCamo"". I got them for my daughter to use for stage makeup (she has been doing character makeup for a small Shakespeare troupe in our county). It works amazingly!

This high-coverage liquid foundation is smooth, easy to apply and gives complete coverage with just a very, very tiny amount. It dispenses from a tube and gives a nice satiney finish. It has an almost undetectable fragrance, and produces no irritation on my very sensitive skin. Truly excellent product."
Great socks! Thin but warm.
Christmas present for a Bieber fanatic!!
My daughters are required to use these ballet shoes to take classical ballet classes at their dance academy. They are great ballet shoes!
"I bought one of these beanies a few weeks ago for my husband to match his hoodie. Needless to say our 12 year old was very envious so I bought him his own as a reward for a full day of spring yard work ;) Great quality, great price and it shows our military pride as a military family."
"Another great sandal from otbt! Very well made, and absolutely adorable. I ordered the gold color and it's exactly as pictured, very pretty and stylish! I will continue to order the otbt brand, as they are worth the higher price.love"
Very sturdy and well made.  It should last a long time.  I really like the loop for hanging this shoe horn from a hook on  my bedroom door.
"These saved my feet during a move. We have hardwoods and tiles throughout our home and during our last move, I wore these as I moved our stuff up 3 flights of stairs and packing everything up. I know they work as I wore them out during that time as they permanently compressed in foot-bed, but the sole held up.

For normal wearing around these are great and will last a lot longer than the abuse I put them through. Give you feet some support and buy these."
"Beautiful soft and comfortable. Very good quality.
Look at different body shapes to select your size. I ordered 5 of the same body shape for 5'4 140 pounds and all 5 fit perfectly. The sixth pair that I ordered for a more curvy hips was too large and too long."
"I like this ring, it's cute and I bought it because I wanted to wear it with other rings or by itself. This isn't my first purchase with Metal Factory so I had pretty high expectations. I was just a little disappointed with this ring because I just recieved the ring and noticed that one of the prongs holding the stone is pretty high. It kinda catches on my clothing and I'm a little concerned that the stone with eventually fall out because of it. To be fair, the ring is such a low price ($2) so it's not totally surprising. It's not super noticeable either unless you are really looking at the ring closely so I'm not too bothered by it."
very good they lasted long
"I have been running on these for about 4 months.  I put about 20 - 30 miles per week on them since I bought them with a grand total of just over 300 miles on them (I alternate between 2 pairs of these for longer life).  They have been going strong but are now starting to show signs it's time to replace them.  Most of my miles are on road pushing a baby jogger and these have held up to the task with flying colors.  Like most minimalistic shoes, yes you can feel sharp rocks but the rock is 2 steps behind you before your brain registers you stepped on it, at least that's how it does it with me.  These shoes have gone up to marathon distances without any issues.

I have only one gripe about them, you need to wear socks.  My first run in them was without socks, as I prefer to run in hotter weather.  I got a great big blister on my arch from a seam inside the shoe.  Since then I added a little body glide before long runs and have not had any issues.  I point this out because the shoe stated it was great for running without socks.  The time I got the blister it was only a 4 mile run so it was not like it was a long distance where I have learned to expect blisters.

Aside from this the shoes are  great investment.  I just ordered a new pair for a Christmas present to me."
I am a size 12 and bought a large - fit perfectly
"I entered ""somewhat large,"" but with a caveat---this is a male-sized shirt. I'm a woman, on the thinner side, with a D bust. So, yes, it's bigger, and I expected that. I bought it intending to shrink it in the wash. The complication arose not from the sizing, rather, the large-sized print. Read on...

(1) Material: Like with all official Pusheen tops I've bought (3 Ts including this one, 1 sweatshirt), the fabric quality is soft and excellent. Definitely higher quality than shirts you'd buy at Target or other popular stores.
(2) Fit: I'm happy that with multiple washings (maybe 3?), it now is a better fit on my shoulders and stomach. (I'm 5'5, approx 140lbs.) It also looks nice on my bust (D), but read on.
(3) Print: The image is cute and funny. The print is definitely ""screened on"" in a ""thicker"" way than most printed shirts. The intention is likely that the image will withstand many washes, without fading. ~Yet--with my larger bust, it's a weird feeling.~ The large Pusheen image wraps around and under my breasts, so they feel strangely ""contained"" by the image's heavier imprint material. I've never experienced this effect before. The image may begin ""cracking"" over time with the bust situation, but again, I recognize this shirt was intended for men and my situation is odd. But, FYI for women with bigger busts.

Summary: I like this shirt. I gave it 4/5 stars because it's a terrific shirt, yet the feel with the larger print is strange and unexpected. I won't dock for the overall fit, though, because I knew what I was getting into. Overall, Gund's Pusheen items continue to be higher quality. They cost more than average shirts because Pusheen is ""so hot right now,"" much like Hansel, but I still want to rock a DJing Pusheen."
"Very cute and seems of good quality.  I'm a 32DD, and I usually wear a size 6.  Thought a large would be okay, but it's definitely too small (both top and bottoms).  Just ordered the XL, and feel confident it'll fit just fine.  Now I'm only pouting, because I had to forfeit my prime privileges to do so.."
"Bought these for my grand-daughter who never seems to be able to keep shoes on her feet. She's 11 yrs. old and whenever we need to leave she ""have to put my shoes on"". Drives her mother crazy! Not any more. These are her 'go to' shoes. And the nice thing is they were priced at a Pay Less price. No $55 dollar price tag. And they are quality leather. Would highly recommend for style and all over cuteness, as well as a good buy."
Gorgeous ear ring set admired by all who see it.  Wonderful match for the 2.00 Ct Oval 9X7mm Green Peridot 925 Sterling necklace.  I highly recommend this product and seller for price and quality.
"Loved this item, I would have given it a five star but they are a bit heavy so I can't wear them 24 hours a day.... just for an evening dinner or a few hours."
"My husband and I each have one for traveling. We both love them! They're spacious and have the expandable zipper if you need a little more space. The inside is actually made of 2 compartments, which is perfect for separating clothes from shoes/toiletries/etc. I love that it rolls and still has the handle across the front for easy lifting in and out of trunks and on and off the conveyor belts. We took these bags on our long trip to Brazil and the bags are still in terrific condition!"
"Bought this for my granddaughter.  Love the style, color, fit, quality and ease of putting on. Her mom misplaced this pair and I ended up ordering another pair next size up.  Testament to my satisfaction of the shoes and the manufacturer."
Material is very cool and comfortable.
"Ordered this bra a size up from what I normally wear as a lot of reviews said it ran small. Getting one size up was perfect. It fits just right. The support is great, and it's really comfortable to wear. So convenient and easy to use for breastfeeding. Plus, the little padding makes the girls look great!"
"I bought two scarves, one for me and one as a gift. They are a wonderful soft material and the zipper pouch is well hidden. It will accommodate a small cell phone like an iPhone, or a small wallet/credit card holder. I liked it so much I bought another one for a gift. Perfect for when you don't want to carry a purse and just need to take one or two items along"
Fit is great.  Fabric is soft.
"I love my new Keds!  They are perfect in so many settings.  I was really impressed with Amazon's price, they are much cheaper here than anywhere else I have looked.

This shoe is a classic."
Hi i like it it is warm thanks.
The absolute best sneaker or sneakers I have ever purchased!!!  I'm able to golf an entire round without my feet and ankles feeling like they are disintegrating!!  If you are experiencing any trouble with your feet or ankles you have to purchase this shoe!!  You won't regret it!!!
"Great fit, comfortable and warm. Exactly what I was looking for in a flannel shirt. You culdn't find a better product for this bargain."
"The first pair of earrings I was not happy with, and I returned them for another pair.  The second pair is perfect; the earrings sparkle, the cuts are clean, and they are matched in size and color.  I could not be more pleased.  In the process, I also found out that this company has excellent customer service."
"Beautiful skirt.  Material does feel cheap, but it looks lovely and hangs well."
I was a little hesitant to buy it but I am sure glad that I did. There's just enough pockets to divide all my stuff just the way I like it and it's not huge.
"Hopefully these will last as long as my other Levi shorts. These are pretty much straight leg shorts and a little lower rise than my Levi Workforce Cargo's, but look to be the same great quality. Just be aware, like my other ones, the sizing gives a little extra wiggle room. I usually wear 33w but these 32w fit great once worn in."
"Best nursing tanks in the world.  padded, but not overtly so, netting on inside of bra area to keep any leaks away from your skin."
Love the socks however they are a tad smaller than what I thought I ordered but fit very snug. Nice lace trim. Next order will go one size larger if available.
My husband is very happy with it. Thanks
I have a few pair of Lee Dungaree shorts. These fit just like the others and I like the new pattern. Will be back for more.
"This is a perfectly gorgeous jacket, and the fake leather really looks and feels convincing. I'd say that this jacket runs TRUE TO SIZE, Hillfiger products are usually cut generously, that has been my experience in the past. My hubby adores this jacket and appreciates the fact that there's no ""cow smell"" as is common with leather jackets especially in the Summer when it gets warm.

This jacket has a classic look and appeal with bomber jacket styling. It's waterproof too,which is super handy if you get caught out in a storm and don't want to ruin your nice leather jacket. It fits really well and is generously cut in the shoulder area, a benefit for my hubby who likes to lift weights and has a larger upper back region due to athletics. The sleeves are perfect as well, niether too short or too long.  This is a hip looking, and sexy jacket particularly for the over 40 crowd. It's classy and simply ""feels good on"" as he says. I ordered one size larger so that he can comfortably wear his favorite sweaters underneath, and I'm glad I did this jacket in XL is perfect and has a bit of extra room for comfort.  5 stars, highly recommended!"
"However, I must have been in a hurry because I ordered the wrong size. My bad! The swim shoes looked like a top quality product, so I was sorry to have to return them. But it was a cinch with Amazon! Unfortunately, t the swim shoes were no longer available with Amazon Prime. So I ended up ordering a similar swim shoe from a different company in order to get free shipping. Too bad! I hope the pair I ordered are as nice as yours!"
Very comfortable and they give the support I need.
"These are a great pair of boots for the price. I ordered the gray leather look boots in a size 8.5, which is my normal size although sometimes it fluctuates with different brands. Upon opening the box I was impressed that these have a really nice color and texture to them, they look like they were more expensive boots. They fit my feet pretty well, and should be decently comfortable to wear. They felt a little narrow at the toe but I have kinda wide feet so that wasn't surprising. They might be uncomfortable for long periods of wear but I probably won't find out until fall/winter (it's 110 degrees where I live right now). I also have short legs so the boots come all the way up to my knee, the calf area is a tad wide but overall they fit pretty well considering I ordered them online. They look cute with my skinny jeans and I will definitely be wearing them come winter. The pictures that other people have uploaded are very accurate to how they look on me, they hit right below the knee and have a nice slouchy look.

Other people mentioned that they were really thin, but I didn't really notice that. I mean, ordering boots online for less than $50 what do you really expect? These are not heavy duty boots, they are just cute and fashionable. I always wear thick socks under my boots in the winter to keep my feet warm, as these boots are not lined heavily enough for warmth. Overall I am very happy with these boots, I like the style and the color, and the material is nice. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I still paid for the product and will wear them, I just received a promotional price in order to review them."
My daughter is very excited about her set. Great purchase
"Best booties EVER.  I receive compliments on these lovelies every time I wear them.  Fit great, incredibly comfortable and FUN leopard print.  LOVE!!!!"
love love love these boots
These are comfy and great for work outs!
"Yes.

Space socks.

Space....

On your feet.

Forget walking on air.

You are walking in a vacuum. Not really.

Space socks!"
"perfect fit, great comfort"
This outfit was super cute and I was surprised at the quality for the price:)
My favorite roller. Well made and designed all around. Top choice. Great value.
"good
good."
"Its true, this World's Greatest DAD Shirt, would make a great Father's Day or Birthday Gift, however I got it for my fiance simply because its true. What a nicer way for dad to know you appreciate him, and think his kiddos have the best dad ever! I love that it comes in so many color options, however black was my favorite option, as it is next ti impossible to stain. The shirt itself is very nice. Thick and seemingly well made. It came with a paper saying ""there is nothing wrong with this t-shit"" explaining the printing process and why the ink on the shirt may look ""weird."" I think it looks great though, and even though the ink may be a bit broken in places it gives it character and by no means takes away from the shirt. My fiance usually wears a 2xl but these days I have been noticing them getting a bit snugger on him, so I am glad I bought a 3xl because it fits him just right with a lil wiggle room. Sometimes plus size shirts are wider but not as long, causing belly to show, but these were just the right length. It felt a little scratchy at first, however after a wash it feels much better. Really happy with this shirt and he is also glad to be adding it to his wardrobe. I received this product at a discounted rate"
As advertised. Very cool.
The double layer of cloth over the crotch makes for some sweaty balls.  Better for the winter.
"Its a cute vest, however it does run small. I bought a medium and my hips are 38 and its snug when zipped. The pockets have nice zippers but they are small. My passport fits but just barely."
My husband wears it everyday. It was perfect
I absolutely love everything about this tunic. True to size. I wore it to work with leggings and boots and received many compliments!
"Love this bag.  Its the perfect size.  One outside compartment for my iphone 8 S, and another for me Rigid wallet.  Yet another zipper inside and two compartments.  Highly recommend"
HOLIDAY GIFT
Love this top and Ive bought a black one also.
Did not expect less from Fruit of the Loom.
Beautiful tie and good quality!  I get many compliments on this tie.
"I am very happy with this bag.  It has many nice features such as a window for my driver's license, slots for credit cards.  Very good value for the money!"
"feels great, looks good."
"Due to breast cancer and reconstruction, underwire support impossible to wear.  This wireless works well and is comfortable. I will be ordering another.  Only drawback, and no way around it, in the heat of the day with 90+ temperatures, the foam gets pretty hot.  But, holds its shape and washes beautifully."
"my daughter love it, thanks Amazon this was the best christmas ever"
"I would not wear these out of the house. They are very comfortable, but they are also a little see-through. The material itself is soft and very stretchy. It's also pretty thin. So thin in fact that I may have to come back to update this review if they don't last very long. Despite washing instructions, I just threw them in with the rest of my laundry. They have been washed in a regular cold cycle and then dried on the regular/high heat setting on the dryer. And so far they've held up pretty well. These are supposed to be capri style pants, but they are only a couple of inches from touching the floor when I wear them. I mean I am 5' 1 1/2'' but still.

Full disclosure: I had the opportunity to purchase these leggings/yoga pants at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. This opinion is 100% my own and I have no affiliation with the seller of this product."
"Just got back from using them, worked very well and the color works because you can see them in baggage clam real easy."
"The colors are vibrant and beautiful and the bag itself seems to be well made.
I don't like BIG totes and already have a few small ones. I needed something mid-sized for my fitness classes. This is PERFECT as my new workout bag. I can fit my towel, big water bottle, wallet and even yoga pad comfortably inside. Of course the yoga mat sticks out but this bag holds it nice and snug.

For the price, I'm very happy with this cute little tote."
This is my second pair the first are still going but look a little worse for wear.  Great boot...
My favorite shoe in the world! great for long hours on your feet. I own four colors...
I bought this as a Xmas gift for a friend of mine but it looks like just what she wanted and it's really very pretty.
"when i saw this dress, i fell in love with it, and i linked it to my friend who showed it to her daughter, and she loved it too (the dress was for her) it was one of the few cute ones i found that carried her side and so happy that it worked out because there were only two sizes left, and no time to switch.  Dress fit as expected. she's 7 and wears 10 in clothes but 8 in dresses and it was perfect.  i found some adorable jewelry on amazon that matched this as well, gold with that teal color rhinestones, and it was so pretty together.  I paired this with small gold huggy hoops, a gold leaf hair band, a gold locket and a bracelet with the matching rhinestones. all bought from amazon prime. heres the pic of the combo i put together for her, minus a little black shrug in case she got cold."
"Bought this as part of a Walter White halloween costume. Perfect. Would be good for a J. Robert Oppenheimer costume too - but a tad more obscure, probably."
I bought this to start my SFX makeup kit and practice some looks this past Halloween and it's been awesome. Perfect to pack into a wound and give it that extra texture regular liquid blood doesn't. It's obviously a small container at 1 oz so it can get pricey if you need it in bulk but it's Ben Nye so the quality makes the price well worth it and the size is great for someone like me who is just starting out.
"My mom told me that I destroyed my first pair of shoes in no time, and I have wrecked every pair since. These are my second pair of merrel trail glove shoes. The first pair was the trail glove 2, and it was the best shoe I ever owned. While most shoes last no more than 4 months, sometimes 6, these shoes went 10 months before causing problems for me. The feel is closer to barefoot than any other shoe I have worn; I prefer them to vibrams because you can reasonably wear socks and they are more comfortable and I would say slightly more durable.

I have ran in these shoes, worked countless hours on a factory floor in them, and as a sending off after 11 months I wore them in a tough mudder. (If you're gonna wear these in a tough mudder you will be better off barefoot.) If you have feet that can handle hitting the ground under their own support like mine, i highly recommend them.

4 stars because this particular pair had a hard spot that gave me a small blister on my pinky toe before they were broken in, which rarely happens to my caveman feet. I cannot remember the last time a new show gave me a blister."
"Beautiful color, beautiful feel. These are lovely shoes and fit very nicely!"
"Comfy, a bit high in the waist"
Love it!  Wearing them now!  I have a small farm and this is what I needed!!
"I wear a size 5.5 and bought a size 6, since the shoes doesn't come in my size. I was hoping that 1/2 a size wouldn't really make a difference, but I was wrong! The shoes came and it was a nice shade of dark red. I loved the ankle strap and the shoes would've been perfect if it was just my size. I can usually pull off wearing size 6 sometimes, but it wasn't the case with these shoes unfortunately. So I had to return it with a heavy heart. I took a star off because the shoes did not come in size 5.5. Otherwise the shoes were really cute."
I got this for my wife. It fit her well. It is short and sexy.
"I don't know about everyone else, but I don't actually want to look as curvy as I do outside the gym while working out (34g). It certainly isn't as supportive as my shock absorber, but it did support well for a circuit training class. You definitely need to clasp the straps for high impact activities."
very comfortable but I have to wear socks for a good fit.
I hoped this would fit and it did.  A little adjustment to the inseam and this will finish the costume I'm putting together.
"Very nice socks.  They're easy to put on, well made and just the right thickness for me.  I bought more of them because of their being easier than other socks to put on."
The Leveret Women Boot Cut Pants are exactly what I was looking for: nice looking but very comfortable pants for a business casual look. The fabric is crisp and stretchy and I expect they won't loose shape. I got both the black and the grey and I love them. Sizing is accurate for this style. I recommend these pants.
"I ordered these for my wife, who wears an 8 in every other shoe/boot I know her to own.  These were at least a half size too big, and unfortunately the next half size down was not available for exchange.  The shoes looked great and were her choice, but she had to change to the Nimbus 14's to get her size.  I knock one star only because they do not run true to size, but had I known that I would have been ok I guess."
"Hi thanks, I got the product very happy for the purchase. Excellent all recommended i give top rating"
"I ordered a medium for my GF (5'3"", idk maybe 120ish pounds?). I'd usually get her a small for all bottoms, but I read another review that said these are asian sizes, and so are smaller than US sizes.

I didn't want my gf to feel bad about not fitting a small, so I just ordered the medium. Turns out, the medium was too big for her and she really did need the small. Also, the material is slightly stretchy so keep that in mind.

Really high quality. I was surprised because Ive seen my gf order other clothes online that come in and its like 4 pieces of clothe stitched together wrong. This was definitely something you'd see at a boutique shop. probably could resell them at a boutique if you had one."
"Cool, eye-catching style! Of course, for the price, you aren't getting luxurious materials, but still a cool pair of shoes."
"My boyfriend has hard to fit feet and he loves these!! He walks all day on concrete and barely sits down. Thank you for fast delivery, a great product and A QUIET BOYFRIEND!!! lol he cant complain now....."
"I purchased these boots to wear during a chicken plant tour. They were perfect with keeping all the ""yuck"" out. They are handy during heavy rains too!"
Very Light weight
My dad loved it. It was so easy for him to adjust when he went from standing up to sitting down. He absolutely loves it. He's a hard to buy for picky person too
Comfortable shoes for kids!
Great watch. No complaints! Love the bands you can switch out. Definitely recommend this product. Great for men and women.
"Really cute, but wasn't sure about sizing. It is more like a juniors fit. I normally am a medium, so that's what I bought. It fits, but a tighter fit. I would have been more comfortable in a large."
My daughter had a larger suitcase that was just too big for her to easily get in and out of her car trunk and way too heavy.  This one is perfect and has four wheels which makes getting around the airport easier. We bought the black one.
I work on my feet most the day and these keep me feeling comfortable and happy. My feet are no longer are hurting at the end of the day
Gave this as a gift to a co-worker -- she loved it! Very versatile and easy to wear.
The shirt looks&fits perfect. Thank you for the fast service.
"I bought 1 size too big but that was my error! Great shoes! Good quality, and very comfy. I would buy again!"
"TOMS does not need to explain , Just wear it."
"These are good quality shoe trees that adapt to the internal dimensions of the shoe.  The construction is solid and the cedar smell is very pleasant.  I have gotten into the habit of putting these into my shoes after a long day's work and they do indeed help my thinner leather shoes keep their shape.  They are also great for working with the shoes while polishing them.  The great thing about these particular trees is the adaptable toe for fitting into a variety of shoe styles, and the whole heel with handle for easy grip while using them or polishing your shoes.  If you have spent a lot of money on shoes and want to keep them fresh, then these are the go-to shoe trees.  Make sure you get the right size for the shoes they will be used with.  They should be firm in the shoe but not stretching out the leather but not too loose to make good contact with the leather.
UPDATE: Having now tried several brands of cedar shoe trees, I recommend these most highly due to the full heal construction, which puts even pressure across the heal and maintains the most natural shape.  Others with a smaller heal seem to distort the shape."
My daughter loved these! They fit perfect
Lovely ring. The light blue color nicely compliments the dark metal and wears comfortably and fashionably.
Very nice hat. My son likes the cool design which made him more likely to wear it.
Nice men's pants
I not bad at all.
arrived in great condition. Pandora charms fit well. Clasp seems sturdy.
Cool & earthy burlap... looks nice but does leave little burlap shred on basically everything. Note to self: avoid wearing black when toting :-/
"The pants are light-weight and comfortable, the belt is a nice addition, although abit too long . I realized once I received it that I should have ordered it in a 36-32 as it was made in Bangladesh and sizes run smaller than US sizes. The 34-32 fit like a 32-32 so I sent it back and had a 36-32 sent to me. It fit the way a 34-32 would fit me. Now I'm happy with the pants, even though the belt's a little too long."
"I got these for my mom, she has a wide foot and needs the room at the toe.  She's very difficult to please, but liked these so much she had me buy them in every color."
My favorite in my dwrar. Double macetomies with reconstruction. These are the best.
This rain jacket was for my son.  I like it because it reflects light and is easily seen.  The XL was perfect for him.  It runs a little big but over clothes it works great.
Time will tell about the durability of these shirts.  They arrived on time and are as described by the seller.  The price was definitely right.
I took it with me to Italy and france . Everybody there was wearing these glasses with blue color lenses . I like it very much and the price is awesome
I love this purse!!  I get compliments all the time!!
These are nice earrings for throw on days.  Great deal for the price.  I also have them in other colors.
Love it-had a hard time finding one with a hood-great color!
My granddaughter LOVED it!!
"I thought these would look too much like bowling shoes, but I actually really like how they look in person. Very stylish, durable, and easy to lace. Fits as expected."
"Cute shoes, very comfortable, fabric is of very good quality as well as the soleplate, they slip on the floor wet immediately, they are a little tight at the top, but I generally love them, use them for the Office and really kept me happy feet =)"
Fits well. Soft light weight.
I love the Skechers Series of shoes. Good fit and they wear very well.
Love love love these booties! Miz Mooz is my go to for shoes and these do not disappoint. The leather was soft from the start and the stacked heel makes the shoe rather comfortable. I can easily wear them for a few hours before I notice the heel. I do think if they had a little platform in the front they'd be more comfortable but that's all I have to complain about. I also love the narrow opening at the ankle. My ankles are not thin by any means but I don't like the large openings that some booties have.
"Great slippers! Super warm and lots of cushion on the bottom. I usually wear a size 7.5 or 8, but I ordered these in M (6.5-7.5). I find that slippers always stretch considerably after a couple wears, so I always size down and I'm glad I did."
Perfect. I had a Kenneth Cole Reaction wallet which lasted several years. This is its replacement~very glad to find this new wallet.
Love these shoes! Bought a second pair for back up!
Great for either casual or dress.
"It's cute and fits well.  It's nice to find a shirt with a slim cut.  I'm tired of shirts being so baggy in the tummy.  And it was a longer length, so that's great too!"
"For this price point, you cannot go wrong.  I needed a simple analog watch for everyday wear but with my new job needing me to dress a little more professionally than I have had to in the past I thought that I would go for a watch with a more fashionable look to it.  After looking at all the Fossil and Citizen watches that met what I was looking for I noticed this Timex.  It had the same look to it, but was a heck of a lot less expensive so I figured that I would give it a try.

I was really impressed when it arrived, as it has very sleek styling and the satin metallic black finish looks just as fancy as the watches going for upwards of $200.  My wife has mentioned on several occasions that it looks great and we even stopped at the watch counter in Macy's to compare it to the more expensive watches, and it fits right in with them easily.

At first I thought that there was something wrong with the date marker as it didn't move ahead after midnight, but then after playing with it I realized that I needed for ""forward"" the watch through a full 24 hour cycle so that it would ""catch"" on the date dial moving the number up at midnight.  Once I did that, it has worked like a champ for two months now without a problem."
One of my favorite Patty shirts.
Tough to get on think frames. But works great once it's on!
excellent quality.... search everywhere in mortar stores and cannot locate would give 10 stars if I could
This bracelet stand looks pretty nice on the top of my dresser. It holds quite a few bracelets and you can see them well to pick one out. I've wanted to put my bracelets out where I can see them for a while but didn't know how to do it. Braclets can take up alot of space if you put them in boxes and if you want to separate them to see them. This black velvet stand looks elegant and makes your braces look nice and they're all in one place so you can find them. Each rod easily comes off to remove the bracelet you want and you can easily set it back down into the stand. I purchase this product at a discount in return for an honest review. I'm enjoying it and it's working well for my bracelets. The only negative comment I have is it was not packaged very well in the box and the packaging it was holding it was torn. This didn't hurt the product at all but wouldn't have looked very good if it had been a gift.
Like it soft comfortable attractive
Stunning!!!!! These are just so darn cute! I love the graphics on them! So clean an crisp! I tell ya your going to enjoy them so much !!
"DVS used to be my favorite shoe company, but I've noticed over the past few years the over all quality has gone down. I hope that they improve for there sake. this pair was good, but could have been better."
Love them.  Wish they had more support but for the price they are great
"Got this as a gift for my brother. He LOVES it!!! I will say that the shirt is a bit stiff though- despite washing it a few times. However, the color is still bright & as patriotic as ever. True to size and well made, I'd buy the shirt again.... just not sure you need more than one of these bad boys in your closet!"
"I recently purchased shoes from a new balance store. So I ordered what fit me for NB. I normally don't get shoes online- difficult feet. These shoes have more cushion than the $110 pair. For me, excellent fit, cushion and comfort."
My husband loves this suit vest he was hesitant to purchase this item because of all the reviews saying it was small but it actually for perfectly. He wears a size 44 chest in blazer so to be on the safe side he ordered the extra large and he looks great in it . I would recommend being safe and get the larger size. The quality is good for the price and it arrived very fast.
My top of the line boot brand is FRYE...I love this boot!
very very pretty and the price could not be beat. I have a very small foot and that type of high heeled just is not meant for a small foot. The peep toe hurt my toes and due to the style I had a difficult time keeping them on. But they were perfect for the occasion and I will try and wear them again.
"These socks have been great! They aren't too thick, so my son's feet don't get too sweaty. They fit extremely well, I need to buy more of them!"
My wife loves wearing these on her run and hike. The colors contrast nicely and are bright and look good. They match her work out outfit in a way that is cute and sexy.
I like these shoestrings good quality very pleased would order again
So far I am LOVING this bra! I am still pregnant so I haven't used it for nursing just yet but as far as fit I was nervous when it arrived bc it looks like it is gonna be big but it's so perfect. So comfortable just what I needed in my life right now.
Another great Ryka shoe!  I love them and they were great from the first time I put my feet into them!
Expensive but works as advertised
This one is one of my favorite sports bras! It felts super cute (still sexy) and fits comfortably. I like that it doesn't have cups that can come out because those always seem to fray and separate themselves from the bar. There's appropriate padding where your nipples won't show when at the gym. This is also very cute and I've very happy with my purchase! Great sports bra to own.
"Great product. Very comfortable to wear. My only complaint is with the internal mesh pockets. It is very difficult to insert items as the corners get stuck in the mesh. It would be much better if the pockets were made of a thin sheet of material, allowing items like passports to be slid in easily. Using the RFID blocking sleeves makes the problem even worse."
"Mommy Shower :)
At the baby shower, surprise the mom-to-be with a bit of pampering when ""it's time."" We chose the Vera Bradley's line of products to create each Go Bag theme. Bradley products add beauty as well as practicality that allow moms to look stylish and feminine while tackling the challenges of parenting for years to come. And..the bags are machine washable! Yay! Note: take the cardboard out of the bottom before washing.

We include the Vera Bradley tote with the Go Bag Basic package, which includes a Tervis tumbler, lid, handle and straw, a massage ball, lip balm, healthy snacks."
"This backpack is great to take on trips and use a day pack, we just did so across Europe. It folds very small, in fact if it had a compression sack of some form, it could probably half as small as it does into it's own pocket. We've not experienced any issues with the material. It's not big, but we had two bottles of water, a rain-jacket, a sweater, a smaller camera and some other stuff in it without it sagging too much or being uncomfortable. The netting material on the straps is nice and we didn't sweat much wearing it.

Funny enough, in Portugal a department store was selling the exact same backpack, just not Eagle Creek branded and bright green for less than $10. So maybe shop around and see if it's available from a third-party before settling for this one."
"Brought as a gift for Mom, she loves that she can wear them in the yard, or when mopping etc., because of the rubber (or plastic) sole. Plus, the price is right. Went back and brought other pairs for gifts."
This is a delicate and beautiful necklace. It is perfect and stylish. Very delicate and it so light weight you don't realize you are wearing it.
"The color, material, fit and length is just what i expected for it to be. It's comfortable, breathable, and makes my boobs look big. Lol!  I love it, and I will be buying the other colors soon. I'm 5'5"" and 110 lbs., bought a small."
Beautifully made shoe and fits me just right.  I usually wear an 8.5 or 9 and the 9 in this shoe is perfect.  I look forward to wearing it on an upcoming trip.
"Know why you want to order this hat?  Because you will not find any linen, ""ivy"" style cap as nice, or as accurately sized-fitted as this, from any online vendor operating in the US.

First, linen is far more difficult and costly to make than cotton-based fabrics.  The fiber it's made from is flax, and one of the few remaining regions in the world that still has a flax farming/manufacturing base large enough to manufacture large quantities of quality linen is ... guess where ... Poland and its surrounding areas/countries.

Second, I literally spent DAYS looking at the offerings of vendors all over the US trying to find a hat like this.  I ordered several, and had to return them all, mainly due to sizing issues.  I've got a big head, and I can never seem to find any caps that I like that quite fit me.  Even this vendor's largest size (XXL -- 62 cm) is right at the limit of the minimum for my head, which measures 61.5 cm.  One of the hats that I returned was SUPPOSEDLY an ""XXL,"" fitting up to 62 cm, but when I received it and measured the circumference of the band, it was actually just a little over 60 cm.  That cap wasn't constructed anywhere as nicely as this one, either.

I paid extra for expedited shipping on this one, and received it within one week of my order.  As I opened the box, I was just praying that it would fit, because this was my last chance to get the kind of cap I wanted to wear to an outdoor wedding ceremony in the coming week, and my time to find one was up.  When I pulled it out of the box and put it on my head, I practically wanted to cry ... it fit me PERFECTLY.  The quality/consistency of the linen is great, and craftsmanship/construction of the cap is very nice throughout.

In sum, I can't recommend this vendor/product highly enough.  Carefully measure your head; follow their instructions on sizing (e.g., if your head measurement falls between two sizes, order the slightly larger one), and you will be very happy."
"Fits as expected and high quality
Even ended up wearing them in a photo shoot"
great watch; it handles all my due dates and excellent military time
these are pretty great boxers they feel like someone is hugging your nethers all day. if you're into that...
love all vionice products
"My husband wore these with his tails for a white tie event. They are very good quality, especially for the price."
looks great. it's either a big watch or my husband has a very small wrist. we need to take out a few links but they are almost impossible to remove. tool keeps bending and no matter how hard we try the pins won't move. we are going to take it to a jeweler to see if they can do it because we're afraid of breaking the wood.
"Very impressed very happy with the fit  , how it feels after hours of wearing it from  a large breasted women im happy !!!!!!!!!"
Gave as a gift to my wife.  She loves it.  Soft material.
"Rather expensive, they may be a little large I really can't tell for sure, Extremely comfortable but they did ride up a little with all day wear."
These boots are warm for our subzero temps even without the second pair of socks.  The best pair I've ever warn and good on our icy parking lots.  They arrived quickly and the dealer was a pleasure to buy from.
"I'm on my second pair, wear these almost every day. You can dress them up or down. Great shoes and worth the price."
Nice product but it's not really meant for busty women.
"Fit as expected. Never rode up, when I was running or riding my bike."
"These pajamas were a Christmas present for my son and they are SO cute. They are a good quality and he loves there is a ""Choo-Choo' on them!"
"Great shoes , very comfortable.  I will order more from them."
"Seem to be well made, but are VERY small ! Can barely see the stone color."
"As an avid hiker I have tried a number of different sock options to ensure I do not get blisters.

This includes sock liners with regular socks. Sock liners with thicker wool socks, and wrightsocks.
For anything other than extreme cold weather I will typically use these. I do prefer the crew to the low cut socks, but I think that is more of a personal preference.
These socks are very convenient in that I don't have to wear 2 pairs of socks, and they do a fine job. I have had some pairs of these socks last over 2 years, and though they don't look extremely thick, they do last a long time.
If you are going to go on extremely long 10+ mile hikes, you may want to take a couple of pairs and swap them out. These socks do seem to be less effective if your feet become extremely sweaty, or if a lot of dirt and rocks are in your boots or shoes.

They are not perfect, but their are the best all in 1 sock solution to avoid blisters."
Great Handbag. Great size and appearance. Lot of space. I get a lot of compliments. Highly recommend this handbag!!
Comfortable. Price was ok. Walmart has it cheaper with the champion brand. Would not buy again due to price. But it did fit and arrive as advertised.
I ordered a size larger and it fit perfectly. If your larger than 44dd you may have issues during into the cups of the bra. I thought the panties and fader would be seperate pieces but it's all in one. Overall nice quality and looked great on me
great watch thank you
"Not to be too specific but I can't remember the last time I bought a bra (especially without trying it on) I have been wearing shelf bra tops for years and as I am getting older I can see these are NOT helping in the support area. Even in the past (in my younger/thinner years) I had trouble finding a good fit. When I saw the photo with the straps  and bra cups almost to the armpit area I thought this might be for me. It is almost unbelievable how this fits. It feels comfortable and there is no side ""boob"" spillage on the sides.. I will send an update after wearing for a while. AND will be buying more! Again, I hate to store shop so I am more than pleased with this purchase and seller!!! Good job to all and Amazon has a good seller with you..I am very pleased all around.. Oh, even better I was able to use an Amazon gift card I got for my birthday..."
The fit is great and the soles are so comfortable!! Love these!
Adorable little shirt/cape
Its a nice dress but was not long enough the picture shows a long maxi dress only came below my knees and i'm only 5'3 the material is very soft runs a little big order a xl and  i wear a xl .
"They fit perfectly.  They were just what she needed for cold Ohio winters.  They were exactky what she wanted so that's what I bought,"
"Exactly as advertised, been using them for a few months and have had no problem. Keeps my hands warm while biking and still able to use my phone"
"I was skeptical ordering this after a few reviewers claimed they hadn't gotten the correct item, but took a chance with Amazon'a free returns. I'm glad I did. I ordered the black, and the stitching is exactly like the pictures, looks really beautiful. The card slots are all a good size and all my things fit well. Lots of compartments in this thing and doesn't look or feel cheap at all. The pleather is soft and the snap on the outside works perfectly. My only reason for four stars instead of five is that some of the stitching (while it's still beautiful) is already coming unstitched in the back, and for having just taken out of the package, that seems disappointing. Other than that, I'm super pleased with the purchase and will probably buy more in other colors."
Bought this for my husband who is always dumping things on his chest of drawers.  Works wonderfully and he loves it!  Now he's not searching for his changing and other what-nots!
nice comfy dress flats...
"I cant brag enough about this. I initially found the brand at TJ Max and ever since  i have been looking for it online , found it here. I train at the gym , do heavy lifting 4 days a week , the material is still  looking great , cant see any sweat , and is so flattering for my body. gorgeous colors too. Recommend."
Seriously comfortable shoes. This is my second pair.
Just a little narrow but very cute.
Absolutely LOVE this tote! So cute and the perfect size!
"Works great so far. Elastic and strong but I don't think it will be strong enough to hold aggressive shoes like basketball, or running shoes. Great for everyday use, walking or work shoes (not construction, safety is an issue)"
I brought this pair of shoe for a cruise 2 years ago but did not get to wear them. This year I wore them to a wedding. Everyone loves them very comfortable.
My son ordered this to take on vacation for a carry on.  It had lots of room.  Just what he wanted.
Love this sterling silver charm! Great detail and high quality piece. Bears the 925 stamp. Perfect size and have already received compliments on it. Great purchase.
Normally I wear a size 8 but got a 8.5 since the sizing is a little slimmer. Going up half a size only made it wider and did not effect the length. Cute plain white shoes and so far comfy!
"I love, love, love my new ring.  I lost mine a few weeks ago and needed a temporary since my wedding ring is way to small.  This fits perfect, sparkles a ton and represents my family tradition.  The only thing I would say I don't like it that the band and engagement ring don't click together so they slide out of place a lot."
"My kids lived in these for our week-long vacation to Roatan!  I bought a small set for my 1-year old and XL for my 3-year old.  They have a cotton pad as the sole, kind of like a towel to make it more comfortable.  We would toss them in the drier so they could put them on dry instead of wet because they didn't dry that quickly, granted it was hot and humid where we were and we wore them a lot.  My son liked them for walking on the hot sand and some of the rocky areas of the beach.  No complaints!"
Super cute. Soft and stretchy  material. The material was much nicer than I thought it would be. I am 5'4 and it is a little long for flip flops but I can wear with some cute wedges or hem it.  Really cute. I want it in other colors.
"These are great I wear them all the time. I had a problem with the shrink to fit, but these fit great."
"I love this ring!  What a bargain for this price.  Mine looks just like the picture,  I think the most attractive thing about the ring is the simple setting- no cheap diamonds trying to make it look like something it's not- just a pretty stone in a very simple, unusual setting. I like it so much I may buy another in a different stone."
Ordered these in brown and chocolate.  I Loved the chocolate and will keep them.  The brown color was more tan.  They are cute and comfy
Super cute I love them fit great except the straps are very loose and do not even touch my feet.
"These socks are great.  They fit perfectly and stay put while I am at pilates class.
Would highly recommend."
"I like them, little loose, but, I can live with it!"
These are perfect for my husband who can't find this style of socks in his size at stores. they are good quality and very soft.
I have largeish hands but I'm not overweight. (my ring finger is size 8.5). These feel comfortable and stretch to fit. The arms feel comfortable and go up above my elbows as I wanted. They are soft and beautiful. Appear white as advertised.
Great beard.  The mouth opening was wider than expected but we were able to manipulate it to appear smaller.  We used this to create Stinky Pete from Toy Story :)
Very soft inside and warm - I have worn it every day since I got it!
"I absolutely love love luv these pants.
To start with i ordered the Sapphire color. The color is very vibrant, just what i wanted to make my boring Mondays joyful :)
These pants have elastic material, gives perfect fit and slimming effect.

Ankle length was just perfect for me, i am short height ed :| - 5' 3""
Just loved it so much that after a week I ordered another one in color Cassie and then after a week one in Dk Charcoal.

Definitely recommend these pants. Perfect for formal office wear.
And for this cost, ah ha :)

Thank you for making these :)"
"I love the LOOK of this boot !!! However, the fit leaves a lot to be desired.  As another reviewer pointed out, the loose fit around the ankle doesn't offer any support to hold or keep the shoe on your foot. Be prepared for a fit more like a slide or clog ., I wear 8.5 to 9. I ordered these in 9, but probably could have gone with an 8..  If you're between sizes I would definitely size down.  With that being said, love the look of these enough that it wasn't worth the hassle to exchange."
So far so good. Easy to handle and fits in my computer bag.
"The suit is perfect it fits perfectly will definitely order again from Tuxgear, I liked the packaging and it got here in two days"
I just try this type of product for the first time and I'm impress! Looks perfect on tank tops or a dress when you don't want to the straps being showing
"Ordered this for my 13 yr old grandaughter. She LOVES it!! It has held up very well, too! She uses it daily, & the fabric & stitching are of good quality."
So happy I got this Fraless Collection Roomy. My winter bag:-) thank you
"Slightly bigger than the other zysun so also holds my iPad (air 2) and mega stuff, seems very durable.  I love the option of the shorter handles or the long strap for over the shoulder or cross body.  Great color and very versatile."
Nice! Would go up a 1/2 size.
I continue to be satisfied with every pair of Propet shoes I have owned. These are no different. Excellent quality product!!
love it!! I've had it for a year and it's worked great
I'm happy to be able to wear these type of jeans.  Losing 85lbs gave me the confidence to go for it.  I'm glad I did.
Super soft and comfy! I like my baby to feel snuggly so they're awesome. :)
"I have two of these, one in black and one neutral.  I wish they came in white.  I like the open bust to keep from feeling ""smashed"" or feeling like I can't breathe.  This design eliminates that.  I also like that it's long waisted and covers so that there's no visible lines."
"good material, I originally ordered the 34(my slack size and was some what small and snug), I missed an earlier review that with these shorts tend to run a bit on the smaller size.
Best feature is the Smart phone extra pocket I've a 4s with a ""mophie"" battery charger, it  slides in and out well for easy access. Will be looking for this extra smart phone pocket on all future purchases of slacks and shorts.
This was as surprise, as in the description info was not listed as a feature and should have been."
Fit great. Tight at the ankle... but plenty room at the top and butt area.
"I love deals and this was a good one very in expensive and my son loves it, fit as expected and wasn't thin or scratchy material."
"I was really excited to rock this bad boy, and based on previous reviews I purchased the largest size they offered XXL(US:L). Unfortunately it was too small. Typically this is the size I wear, I'm 6'3'' 197lbs with a 34"" waist and a 42"" chest. I figured the US Large would have been perfect, I was able to button up the vest but it was noticeably tight. Aaaaaalmost. I have to return it and find something a little bit bigger. For the price this was awesome, but I still had to give it a decent rating as the price was excellent and the style was sharp. If you are going to purchase, go one size larger than normal."
Simple. These go with everything.
Ordered up like other reviews said to and its awesome! So cute! Quick delivery too!
"I stated that they fit as expected, and they did, but I wear 48 X 32 in dress slacks, and Levi Jeans 46 X 30 fit well.
So, yes they fit as I expected them to fit, one size smaller than dress slacks.
The quality is good, they wear well, but they are expensive for Made in Mexico products.
If I bought allot of these, I think that I would look elsewhere."
Perfect shoe.  The leather is absolutely perfect and so durable.
"I was browsing Amazon for Christmas presents when I came across these next level T-shirts. During the summer months, I wear a different T-shirt every day. I used to be a guy you see in the gray or tan T-shirt walking down the street. My wife couldn't figure out why my T-shirts were either tan or gray and asked me to loosen up and put some color in my life. I gave it some consideration and I decided maybe it was time for a change. Several years ago I began purchasing T-shirts in various colors. When I saw the rainbow of colors available from Next Level, I decided the royal blue and the Kelly green T-shirts were good colors for me. To date, I've worn a green shirt, I've washed it and still fits. The material has a good feel and it drapes well for my somewhat overweight body. I tree treat clothing items like shorts, T-shirts and pants as commodities and I look for the best value for my dollar. When I purchased the two Next Level T-shirts, they happen to be a good value so I bought them. As it turns out, the quality of the shirts, the fit of the shirts and the feel of the shirts make them a great value."

"Very good. It it not too thick, but fit well, stay on. I am 5', 100lbs. I ordered a second one after the first purchase. There is a little smell when arrive. But it goes away totally after two wash."
"my husband has been having trouble with his running shoes of late-- the last three pairs lasted less than 6 months each, with normal use( walking dog, running errands, kids to school).  As a runner, I have had good experiences with my ghost shoes in the past, and decided to order a pair.  So far, he is very pleased.  Very comfortable for his needs, both on the treadmill and running errands.  Only time will tell if they hold up better, but so far, so good..."
"these boots go above and beyond my expectations!! I was afraid to order without trying on as I have a somewhat small foot for my height! I am 5'7"" with a 6.5 size foot, my problem is my feet are WIDE, I have a very difficult time finding shoes that accommodate my size and width so I usually end up ordering a size bigger to make up the difference, I got these and they are so comfortable,  I could have gotten these in the right size and they would be perfect. I would say if you have a narrow foot these may be loose, but I would try them anyway. absolutely no regrets purchasing these!!"
"Long and very thin necklace, this is great for those charms that you want to hang close to your cleavage."
I never Cary a purse for more than a few weeks. I've been carrying this for months. There is absolutely no downside to this. I'm probably going to be getting another for summer but will go back to this in the fall. Of course the little scarf thing came off immediately but that's just personal preference.
"Soft, warm. Shrank a bit in the wash but its still a medium. I'm 5'9"", 175 and the medium is snug but not skintight, sleeves are a tad short."
"I bought this one for my husband.  He usually wears a large (he's just over 6 feet tall and weighs about 190 pounds), I bought a large for him and am glad we did.  My husband has long arms, the sleeves are plenty long enough.  The hoodie fits well, looks good and appears to be well made.  My husband says it is comfortable and he likes the extra pockets.  It is light weight (not lined or insulated) but that is what we were looking for."
So much more comfortable then I thought they would be!  Lining of footbed is soft and the contouring fits my foot great.  The style is awesome.  Quality and workmanship that I expect from Clarks.
"Adorable jacket, we've received tons of compliments on it. It keeps him toasty warm and fits great"
"These are the most comfortable because of the 56% cotton, but they don't shrink because of the polyester blend. I wear a size 10-12 & buy a large. You can put them in the dryer too. I have 4 pair. No wonder their ratings are so high. They're thinner material than the high spandex percent ones, making them perfect for summer. Feels like a t-shirt hugging your bottoms. ;-)"
Ordered a Large... I needed an XL (so order up 1 size ladies) but its super cute and I get tons of compliments in it... looks nice on me on the back of our bike too! Company awesome to work with to exchange and rec'd item quickly! Good purchase at an awesome price!!
Beautiful shoe they are alittle wide for my narrow foot but love the color and feel
"Fabulous, comfortable and the look very expensive. The price was fantastic bought two pairs"
"Nice socks. They're socks. Amazing, for socks... I guess."
It came pretty fast and fits my daughter great
Love the fit!!! The material is high quality...great to wear on its own or under a blazer for a more relaxed look!
Looks beautiful when worn.
VERY comfortable!!  tagless. I plan to buy more
So cute!  More space than I expected. My 3.5 year old loves it & is able to roll it by himself!
"Great Delivery, great nice looking watch, big but not that big that overpowers your wrist. Pretty confortable, lot of funtions and feautures."
"Super cute! Definitely not for support but just an easy, light thing to wear when I'm hanging around the house with a t-shirt... not wanting a full bra."
"Three years later and I still love this shirt! I'm 5' 8"", skinny/average girl. I bought this in XL and I love how it fits. I'm obsessed with dragons and love baggy shirts so this is pretty amazing."
"Totally tailored, fasionable fit that snugs nicely across the hips and drapes very clean and comfortable down the leg. Have been trying since arrival to get a picture but they're obviously comfortable enough that movement can't be slowed!"
"Very warm and fluffy. Have held up fine after 1 trip through the washer. I wear a size 10 shoe and these fit just fine. Don't really smell the lavender scent, however. I wouldn't buy these socks hoping to smell lavender."
Son really loves these. Fits nicely and comfortable.
"Perfect fit, perfect color.  I can't wait to wear them!"
"I have 2 OGIO backpacks that replaced 2 Everki backpacks this is one of them. There is a ton of storage, quality is good, they are comfortable to carry the straps don't slip (my main complaint with the old ones) the only down side to this one is that is is not TSA friendly, the other OGIO I have is so I switch off. The only other thing I miss on this is the clip for the keys in front but it has a zipper compartment in the strap to cover that. I had even purchased a Tumi Alpha and these are still better for me at least when it comes to functionality, and they cost less."
Teen daughter very happy with her snow boots
Sons favorite. XXL with big rear weighing 240 lbs.
Super comfortable and waist fits great. I'm 5'10 and they are pretty short on me but I bought them to wear under snow pants so they'll do
Pretty Bow Brooch.....Nice color...Not overly large....
My daughter is a my little pony fan and was happy to finally get some mlp pjs.
We ordered this for my 11 year old.  It was a bit large but he loved it and it fit well enough to wear to school.
"When my husband gave me my charm bracelet it needed some more charms on it, so I ordered these and I am so pleased they fit on it beautifully. Thank you guys... Sheila B."
I had purchased these last year for my daughters for Christmas (4 girls ages 3-11). They are unable to wear anything that isn't gold or silver but too irresponsible for something too expensive. These earring look gorgeous and they don't irritate their ears and the best thing is if they lose one they are economically easy to replace.
"These ""Dark Used"" jeans are 85% cotton,  13% polyester and 2% elastane.  The jeans come right up to one's hips. The fabric molds to one's body.  There is definitely some stretch to the material, which can make these warm in hot weather, but are comfortable while sitting down and standing. The jeans stretch out over the day and shrink back during the wash cycle.

These jeans fit snugly from waist to knees, then flair out some to the ankles.  No butt crack!  The dye has that ""used"" look in the thighs down to the knees, but is even across the butt and legs. Front pockets are small (3"" deep) but back pockets are deep enough for a normal wallet, 5"".

Made in India.

I am 5'7"" and weigh 135 pounds. Normally size 8 is fine with me.  The 28x30 jeans are a perfect match."
"This is super cute! The pads don't really stay in place but overall it's very comfortable. Would buy again. I'm a 34A, ordered a small, fits perfectly."
"Love my chucks... always love chucks, and they always fit a bit larger than what you're used to (I got a men's size 6.5, usually wear a 7 in men's, as I wear an 8.5 or a 9 in women's, and I probably could've gotten a 6, although my feet tend to be wider so that's why I went with the 6,5).. the color is pretty much like the picture on my monitor, and I absolutely love my new shoes!"
I'm a big fan of crocs.  These are very comfortable but they run big.  I usually wear a 9 but these 9s are too big.  Luckily a medium weight sock helps that problem.  I bought a light blue and black pair.  Light blue is a big light but the black are really sharp with black pants.
They keep my feet warm
"This hat rocks, looks great and very well made!"
I had to re-order a size up and even that is still pretty small. I recommend going 1-2 sizes larger! It's cute though!
Like it.  Good quality for the price.  I like that it doesn't have the little ball bearing at the crown of the hat to hurt your head it you happen to hit something.  Instead it is sewn in and has a velcro tab at the very top.  Pretty nice unit.  I recommend it.
Much better than expected!! So beautiful!
I bought these for my nephew who works in a refrigerator cooler.  He says they keep him warm without being bulky.  He also says they launder well.
HER birthstone dangle  spacer bead charm look very good on her arm I will buy some more for her ok
"Excellent item.  It really is very comfortable.  Be advised to air dry not put in dryer after washing.  Otherwise, a perfect buy for someone who is looking for comfortable socks if you have ""toe"" issues.  Keeps your toes warm and cozy."
I am addicted to boots and this pair is one of my favorites! It arrived in like two or three days. I use it alot lately and it is comfortable pair. Very light boots than I expected.
"Pleased, they're a gift."
My husband loves these socks.  It is quite difficult to find socks other than your standard black dad socks with no personality.  These are fun and hold up well.
"The striking watch is very cute, fashionable, but short automatic rope if I leave a day without using suddenly stops, if you use it every day enjoy an attractive watch for a ridiculous price"
"I just started taking water aerobic classes.  I wasn't sure if I was going to like wearing shoes in the water, but they are very comfortable.  I bought them to prevent athelete's feet, and plantar warts that you can get from walking barefoot.  I would strongly recommend buying these.  Free shipping was a plus."
great for the price and came fast! very cheap material but just as I expected.
"My daughter is 5'4.5"" and 115lbs she normally wears U.S. sizes - a small in long sleeve shirts because her arms are long and she is a size 3L in juniors pants
I bought her a medium in the giraffe onesie pj's and it fits great! It looks just like the one Meghan Trainor is wearing in one of her videos"
Loved the bracelet and it was delivered when stated!
"so far so good---as described ---perked up motorcycle  saddle bags and waterproofed ---used it on boots, chaps and whatever other leather i have and everything is good"
Great Product!  Will buy again.
"My son loves these. they fit him just right, i ordered size 10 which normally is too long or too big in the waist but hes too large for size 8. these fit him perfectly. they are warm and on nights like tonight when its 6 degrees and then with winshield -10 its needed."
"I ordered up 2 sizes since I wanted to make sure it was roomy.  Probably could have ordered up only 1 size but I am happy with my choice.  I have been looking for a Navy blue vest with inside pockets for over 2 years now.  I don't carry a purse, just my cell phone with drivers license and a couple credit cards so I wanted a vest with an inside pocket.  My old navy vest with inside pockets faded and looked horrible.  This one looks great!"
"The suit is great. Looks and feels like a man's professional suit. However, I ordered a 4 and the ""4"" is more like a 4T. I have a black 4T suit already and I compared them both and they were IDENTICAL to each other- pants, jacket, everything. So if you want more like a 5T or a 4, go for a 5."
Comfy socks. Looks just like the picture.
Love them and for the price no complaints.
"I can't say enough about how useful a shemagh can be in hotter climates.  I keep at least one of these handy in my camping/survival gear for many reasons:

- Keeps you cool when it is wet, either worn just around the neck or wrapped around your head
- Makes a great arm sling
- Can be used as a camp towel or wash rag
- Could be used as a tourniquet in an emergency
- Makes a great bandage wrap for a big wound
- Keeps the sun off your head/neck
- Can be used to pre-filter mucky water that you need to prep for drinking
- Partial head/neck camouflage
- Protects my neck during paintball play while keeping me cool

I keep finding more and more uses for this shemagh.  I now own 4 different colors.  They are easy to wash, and you just let them air dry.  Instructions say to machine wash cold on a delicate cycle or hand wash, and air dry only.  Wring it out, let it air dry for less than a half hour fully opened up, and it's dry and clean."
"I've used these in average hikes, paved jogs, trail running, biking and elliptical. Sometimes it hurts the bottom of my feet on elliptical and while walking. But it has excellent traction and I've never had an issue with it while running. I'll buy them again."
"I bought my first pair of asics a few weeks ago and loved them, so came back to Amazon looking for a deal on similar.  Found this pair ""4E"" shoes on deep discount. I know I have wide feet, but I was skeptical about the 4E being too wide.  So I read up what Asics had to say about it, which was that the actual width may only vary by a milimeter or a few.  When I got these, I compared them to the ""normal"" pair I already had, and holding them tread to tread against each other, I could not see that the 4E was any wider at all.

For me this was great news because I wasn't really looking for a lot wider. So the information to share is this .. the ""wide"" actually comes more in the form of the cloth-like materials above the tread base.  I have very high arches, and on the ""normal"" shoes, the tongue bulges out and laces look liek they are covering a big gap.  On these 4E shoes, the shoes look normal, like they fit!  I now feel educated about what wide really means ... I will definitely be back for more!"
love these shoes. I bought couple pairs with different colors to wear to the office.
"I am used to the old fashioned kind of leather key holder that zips as this one does, but the keys had to be slipped under and through little key chain holders. It was very difficult to do, and one could lose some finger skin in the process. This Genuine Leather Key Chain Holder Coin Pocket #412CF is a bit larger than what I'm used to, and instead of getting right to work inserting the keys (as I am used to) I am sitting here trying to figure out how to open these larger key chains without breaking them off of the holders. Okay done. Do not order this key chain holder unless you first have a pair of needle nose pliers, a regular medium sized screw driver and some very strong fingers. I was able to open a few of the key chain holders with my fingers, but with some I absolutely needed pliers. If you should open the individual key holder too wide to close it, gently close the holder with the pliers until you have a snug fit. All this is actually as easy as I hoped it would be.  The Leather Key Chain Holder has been my preferred style for the last twenty years. The main problem is eventually the the small circular holders for the key chains will break out of the holding bar (that is attached to the leather across the top) These key chain holders would last a lot longer if one remembered to be gentle, every time you unzip the key chain holder to grasp an individual key and slowly insert your keys into your doors and other types of locks. This can be a hard thing to remember depending on what kind of day you are having! From experience I have learned to carry an extra set of keys on a small round key chain, just in case one of the keys happens to come lose without me realizing this. These appear to be solidly made so I would not expect any problems for at least a year or so. I am giving this the highest rating because, this is my type of key holder in style, plus I like the new wide key chain holders, that are easier to manipulate than they look, and you simply cannot beat the price!"
"Even though I thought this romper would be more saggy at the top, it was still cute and worked well as a swimsuit cover. It was very comfortable and the material is soft. After washing, no shrinkage or fading."
"They are just precious little earrings.  These little Celtic knot 'star"" earrings are very well made and comfortable to wear."
We loved the shirt but it was for a slim man and it needed to be more fitted.  It would fit the average tall man great.
I bought it for the public Sauna at my gym.  Others want one also
"The stone seems a bit clear, but maybe that's typical of this type of stone.  This was also true of the other piece of jewelry I received from another company.  Great ring otherwise!"
this  was  a gift  and  my  boyfriends daughter loved it.  she  has  worn them with  sweaters and  t s***s  great product.
Cute Easter socks
and she loves it  .
Very comfortable shoes I expect to be wearing while standing in the long lines at the VA.
"I really like these shoes.  They're perfect casual shoes that go with anything.  They are warm because of the water-resistant material which can be a good or bad thing depending on the climate where you live.  They are very comfortable, but not as cushiony as Converse (although much lighter and more flexible).

I would definitely buy again."
Very comfortable beach dress. Straps can be worn in a variety of ways for a different look. Travels and washes well. Fabric is light and airy but is not see through.
"I really like these shoes, they are cute, comfortable, and great for the trails.  However, the rubber on the toe came away from the shoe my first week of wear. I really do like these shoes, they are such a great price, and I feel like it was a fluke, so I'm giving them another go again. I returned them and Amazon was excellent about the exchange."
Super cute and holds up well in the water and to washing. They fit my son great. Will absolutely buy again!
This jacket is very good.like this gift so much
Worth the money they are so pretty comfy and durable. As a mail carrier i cannot wait to hop into these babies soon as i get home everyday.
"Am I the only person who has never seen a shirt like this?  Its incredible!  The inside of the sleeves are lined and quilted.  The rest of the inside is lined with what I can only call faux lambs wool.  If youve ever seen the lambs wool car mitt. . . or lambs wool throw for babies.. . thats kind of what its like, though its polyester.  If you look at the color of the picture of the shirt, and zoom in, you can see a little of it.  Its VERY comfortable.  Makes it nice so you can go out when the weather is cool, and not have to wear a jacket.  Depending upon where you're going you might want to layer and wear another s*** underneath, just in case you get too hot and need to pull this one off.

Ive washed it, and it did very well.  No problems there.

At the current price, if this were just any other flannel shirt, I would think its a bit expensive. . . but because its lined throughout, I think its quite affordable."
Absolutely love this kimono.  Looks wonderful with jeans or a fancy black dress!  Great addition to any wardrobe for any occasion!  Thanks amazon!
"Purchased the wallet to protect my credit cards while overseas and to carry my passport and as far as I can tell, all is well. The wallet is not designed for yu to carry an unlimited number of credit cards so you will have to prioritize which cards you travel with. Beyond that, it held my passport securely and I had no problems with the quality of the material or its design. I would definitely buy this one again!"
"I ordered a size larger to have a looser fit and it is still a bit too tight but with a jacket is will work for the occasion I needed it for. Great fabric, I intended to order only one and two arrived. A black dress can always come in handy! I will keep both!  Seems I ordered two by error..lol"
Great under armour quality.
These are exactly what I was looking for! Nice quality flip flops that fit my son's feet perfectly!
This isn't bad.
Glad it's large because I like my lounge around stuff loose and comfy.  Soft material.
Loved the shoe but much too large - had to return them. No smaller size available.
Bought it as a gift for my mother for Christmas and she loves it!! Great fit and the material is nice too..I would recommend this to any woman..
My husband loved these shoes! He is a Merrell fan and this shoe meet his expectations!!! I would highly recommend this shoe!
I'm 5'6 and 130  lbs.  I ordered the Small and it fits.  Material seems sturdy yet stretchable.
I love the bag. I love the long handles on this bag. Looks trendy & durable.
"Very Pretty I really like the length looks great dressed up or down!
I'll be buying more colors!"
love this dress for casual or the dress of the night
If u buy grey and sweat a lot maybe this isn't for you. I change my tshirt from heather grey to sweat grey in about 15 minutes of exercise good thing it breathes easy and looks good.
bought these boots for a hiking trip to the Smoky Mountains kept my feet warm and dry
My daughter was thrilled to receive them. They got her perfectly.
"Beautiful pants but they are baggy on my very thin daughter. :( They will go to my niece who is a more average size. If you have a super skinny little peanut, I would not recommend this style. Levi's does make skinny jeans that look nice on her though. The farah glitter and night out are two styles that fit her very nicely. The trinity style is sort of right in the middle but leaning more on the skinny side. I wish I could find a boot cut style that fits my little peanut nicely but these are not the ones. The search continues! I still love the quality of Levi's jeans though, and will continue to purchase them for my very active kids!"
"This dress is a steal at $20. Wore it to an event & got a ton of compliments. If you are chesty, they will be on display (but hey, what else are the girls to do, amiright?).  ;)  I almost felt awkward telling people it was a $20 dress, because you know your response to a compliment is the obligatory ""thanks, I got it at <insert store name> for $$"".  It's a wee short too, but it shows off those great legs ya got! Honestly, it's a great little dress & doesn't look/feel cheap."
"The size is a bit large, but I am a thin guy, so yea all good."
"This is the third one I bought, worked very well in very windy conditions.  Did flip up when opened once due to high winds, but didn't break.  Very well made and extremely durable.  A tremendous value for the price, can;t go wrong purchasing this item.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Benkii-60-Mph-Windproof-10-Rib-Travel-Umbrella-Purple/dp/B01N2GNCE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Benkii 60 Mph Windproof 10 Rib Travel Umbrella, Purple</a>"
I'm so excited that the shirt came looking the way I wanted it to. I was worried because when I was sizing the image it said if it was too large it could come out looking fuzzy but thankfully it came out clearly. It got here when it said it would & it fit great.
I purchased this for my niece as a gift for the birth of her daughter.  I wanted her to have something very special and this was it.  It says it all and is completely beautiful.  I am very glad I purchased this for such a wonderful occasion.
"Light weight crew sock that's perfect for the warm climate where I live. Fits well. Very comfortable. The one negative is the lack of any reinforcing around the heel or the toe area, so they wear out fairly quickly. Still, the price is right."
"Update: I have given these boots to my sister. Her feet are slightly smaller than mine, so these boots are definitely either made smaller or they are mis-sized somewhat. Still, I need to order a size larger next time. If I can ever find these Bearpaw Chestnut Distressed  Emma shirt boots again. Love the distressed leather!

Previous review:
I have several pair of these boots and have never had a problem with putting them on until I received these. I have requested a return, but unfortunately a size larger is not available in this particular color (chestnut distressed).  The problem I had with these is that the shaft is so small around I cant get my feet down into them.  Hoping this is just a flaw on one pair of boots. I may try to order them in this same size in a few weeks. Will gladly change this review when I get a pair that fits. I love Bearpaw boots and have never been disappointed until today. Huge disappointment!"
"The quality of this while it is exceptional. The leather feels very soft yet strong, and the color is exactly as I expected from the picture. My husband prefers smaller wallet, so this isn't one he would Carrie, but I like the size for myself to throw in my purse, so it works great for me.  I do think it would probably be a bit too bulky for a man to comfortably carry in his back pocket all the time."
"Absolutely Gorgeous , sparkles and just a beautiful piece of jewellery"
"Very pleased with this t shirt. I will order more colors in the future. This T shirt is not tight through the midsection, so it offers a flattering look that spares revealing too much!"
I always buy ascis shoes. This pair of ascis were a gift for my mother. She loved it! I suggest to order 1 size more than you usually order.
"Very soft and comfy.  Fits great, nice length.  Strong velcro hold.  Very happy with product!"
Fits my 4 year old perfectly.  He loves it.
Love my Jack Rogers and the price was unbelievable.
So cute and durable.
I would give this 6 stars.  Beautiful!
Got these for my son and he loves them.  Super lightweight!  Flexible beyond belief and loves wearing them to coach Jr. High sports!  Nikes are not for wide footed types... they usually run small so order 1/2 size or so up.
Nice jeans at a nice price.
"Working security in the Pacific North Wet(intentional)having some  level of waterproof is necessary, especially because a lot of the time I do security for a port. These fit the bill, they don't absorb water and it can be shaken off easily. They have many awesome pocket options. That is great if you need to store many different items. They are a good pant for security work. I am going to be buying another pair. They are comfortable.

I noticed that they are a little short however so I would order a size longer and larger than you normally would. And like I said, LINT ROLLER. They collect everything. Even given that I love these pants."
"Bought for my son and he loves them! They even look better in person.  Perfect fit, and exactly as described.  Couldn't believe we got these at such a low price, they're really nice and look much more expensive.  Shipping was lightning fast, we couldn't be happier with them!"
Love these shoes. So comfortable and beautiful. I can walk all over campus with no issues.
"I bought these underwear because I have always been a Hanes type of women. Never really liked wearing the cute and frilly underwear types. I prefer comfort over anything else. I've been purchasing Hanes underwear for many years now and I don't think I will ever switch. I've bought different styles from boy shorts to bikinis and I really prefer these hipster style ones. They just fit my body the best and this amazon price is a bit lower than in store prices. I ordered to pack's and they both came in cute colors and prints. I got a purple-ish brown, a white with tiny pink and purple dots all over it and lastly a light pink. I often wear cloth pads and I do find that these hipster panty's are a bit wide in the gusset region for me for click my cloth pads in place but it's not horribly uncomfortable, I just need to buy more of these in bikini style I suppose. Whenever I reach in my panty drawer for a clean pair I always prefer these, I just am thrilled with this purchase. I definitely recommend these."
Looks just like the photo.
Playtex is always a dependable brand. I wish they had more sizes available.
"Comfy, pretty and stylish. The only downside is that it will get dirty really soon. Mine from 1 time wear it looks worn out for more 20 times. Runs a little bit larger which is good."
Small but beautiful stud earrings.
"Wear this all the time for business meetings, so many compliments!"
way better then i even expected. size is spot on and i had no idea the inside was cheetah print. it just adds to my love for it. please note when you walk on hard ground it sounds like your wearing heels. i for one love that sound (:
"run small, and can buy similar ones cheaper at walmart."
"I absolutely love this bathing suit! It is so cute. I purchased it because I needed a cute one piece to water ski in. I feel so sassy in it!

(UPDATE) The stitching in the back started coming apart! =(  Nothing like showing a little butt crack on the boat.  That being said, it got a lot of wear.  Broke my heart!"
"Quality is great, pads are a little awkward. I removed mine and it was just as great. I only recommend that if you are a woman with a large busy but a smaller frame you should go down a size. I wear a DDD but the XL was still a bit too big. Still able to wear comfortably under my maxi dress."
This was adorable.  I got so many compliments.  It's just sexy enough without looking like you're walking into a bedroom.  Suitable for a fun Christmas-themed event!  It is a tad itchy though.
great to wear under a jacket or for business casual
Very cute color and material. Versatile to wear during any season (except snow of course) and it fits well and isn't too tight which is a plus especially since I have fat feet. I didn't give it five stars because I haven't walked all day in it yet so will post about full day comfortability later
"Many reviews tell buyers to go up a size, don't listen! I usually wear a small but ordered a medium initially and the top bodice was way too loose. I'm 120 lbs and a 34D and it was pretty loose. A size small fits me perfectly tight on top. Dress looks awesome with the Viana petticoat too :)"
"I bought this wallet as a gift which I have yet to give. However, I am very pleased with the look and feel of the product and I fully expect that it will be well received as a birthday gift soon."
I have worn NYDJ's for a long time  I usually buy the Marilyn style because they fit and are comfortable and make me look a size smaller---Yea Yea
My daughter is 6 years old and she loves her new swimsuit. It fits her just right! It's very pretty!
"I am 6'0"" and 165 lb with 33 size waist and bought two Red colors in M and one Super Blue in L size to compare and chooe one. There is a bigger than expected size difference between the M and L sizes. I usually opt for the large in many jackets and tops I buy because I have very broad shoulders but lean body, but in this case the Large was bulky. It is very wide cut especially around the waist. It depends on how you want it to fit; Just as a rain jacket, the large is fine with room for a sweater or sweatshirt when it's cold I would choose the large for hiking. The Medium fit just right, looks good even for a casual wear with not much room for a bulky sweater but can wear a sweatshirt or long sleeve T-shirt under it for warmth. Mind you, all pictures were taken while wearing a t-shirt only. Also there is definitely a slight but noticeable cut difference BETWEEN THE TWO MEDIUM sizes I purchased caused probably by period of production and slight design changes that accompanied it. For starters the Rocket Red fit me more nicely with a slightly more room around the shoulders and wider overall cut and the mesh was softer and more fine. overall more comfortable to wear. The Mountain Red was a little snug around the shoulders and sides and the mesh is definitely coarser on my arms which is fine, but since I have broad shoulders I chose the Rocket Red. The Mountain Red had a solid polyester fabric right below the collar where the Columbia tag is for durability, but the Rocket Red was soft mesh all the way to the edge of the collar. Also the mesh interior is more fine and softer on the Rocket Red than the  Mountain Red. Also the Blue one has fine soft mesh also and missing the collar solid polyester  fabric. I would bet the Rocket Red is a discontinued product since it's not offered on Columbia.com as well as many of the colors offered here on Amazon. So I can assume the colors here that are not offered on Columbia's website are probably discontinued and will have a softer mesh and fit a little bit more loose or classic fit. I guess Columbia upgraded it to make it more durable around the neck area and fit more modern a little bit. I would also like to add about one other review that said quality defect in one pocket being sewn all the way to the hem but not the other pocket(Left pocket), IT IS NOT A QUALITY ISSUE, that pocket is where you pack the jacket. it has a two sided zipper, so you can turn the pocket inside out and pack the whole jacket inside, so it's intentionally sewn that way. All the three jackets I got where sewn like that. It will have a patch near the zipper pocket that says PACKABLE. Overall really nice quality jacket as to be expected from Columbia, and a steal on these prices, in stores it usually is  twice."
Carhartt stuff rocks and this shirt lived up to that.  Looking to get another one of these shirts in another color.
Not exactly the style shown but very close.
"I love the fit of these shoes, not tight at all and I can wear thick socks. On the box they say ""Relaxed fit"" so not a wide shoe but ample space for good socks. Nice grip soles but not enough to ""trip"" you. Love the reinforced rubber toe for when on my hands and knees the toe of the shoe does not get scraped."
Love this sweater.  I have 3 in different colors.  Washes well.
And very nice stretch. Not too tight on his feet/ankles. Good buy.
"I got it in a variety of colors for playing tennis and they're great for that, go perfectly with colorful sports bras. Light, breezy and they make you look super cool ;-)"
Skechers are the most comfortable athletic shoe I bought. Tnx
Such a great dress. It's stretchy and comfortable and fits just right. I'm pleased with the fabric quality and can't wait to choose another one!
Love them feel great..
"Zumba classmates admire my scarf. The cloth is velvety. It has more coins than other types of scarves, but they make less noisenot sure why. It's encouragement to to shake harder. The knot slips if I don't double it."
Great pants.  Good price.  Lightweight for those hot days.
Nice earring I only wish they were a little heavier!
"Cute, only find at Amazon"
This shoes are extremely comfortable. I am waiting for my size to be available in other colors so I can get more!
"The rose tone color is on point, the bracelet appears to be well made, is very pretty and the price was economically feasible. The bracelet can be worn with jeans or a cocktail dress to a formal affair."
Really like this t-shirt and the color is as the web-site pictured it.
My nine-month-old baby hasn't made any complaints about the shoes when she wears them so I assume she likes them
"I don't usually write reviews, but these sandals deserve a 5 star rating. The most comfortable sandals I've ever owned. Looking forward to wearing them a lot this summer."
My daughter loves this present I got her for Christmas 2013. Still wears them most days to school.
"Very comfortable, fits great. And they are so soft. Thay move when I move."
"Easy to pull up and maintain shape the entire day (I'm 5' 4"" and 128 lbs). The black cat part feels thicker and higher quality than the nude tights part, which seem a little thin and needs more care while stretching. When I first got the tights, the merge between the black cat ears and the nude colored thigh section was already strange as there seemed to be some black not belonging to the cat ears on the nude section. After wearing this for a day outfit 5-6 times, the line between the black cat ears and the nude tights has begun to fray, and the soles and ankles of the feet have begun pilling. A really cute and comfortable buy, but not meant to last long-term."
Maybe like half a size to big but okay. SUPER COMFY. And they got wet but dried quickly. SUUUUPER comfy.
"I bought this sandals a few months ago and absolutely love them, got lots of compliments but unfortunately I lost them, so I'm ordering another pair and thinking I might get the red ones later.  I recommend this product, TEVA sandals are great!"
Boonie caps are great for yard work or a day at the range.  Keep the sun off your ears and outta your eyes.
"This is my second pair of gladiator crocs.  These are somewhat smaller than my first pair.  Still love them, very unusual looking."
"I bought these for my son. He loves them! He said they keep his feet warm and dry and he trekked for days in them and was comfortable the entire time. Good deal, and he's happy, so it's a win,win!"
Nice swim trunks. Bright color and dries reasonably quickly. If you are between sizes get the smaller as they run slightly large.
"Of course purple is my favor color, but i bought some long sleeved shirts to wear at work, because it's always chilly there."
"I got this for my husband to wear near constantly. After having it for a few months it finally broke, the rubber in the clap snapped, but my husband is hard on things. I bought two more because he liked them so much."
"Okay, this says it is a 3/4 sleeve but it is definitely long-sleeved. It is comfortable. It looks great with jeans. It is loose and blousy and it is chic. I wouldn't have bought this for myself but now that I have it I will definitely wear it. It is stylish -- better than a plain old t-shirt."
"Looks great, feels great. Just dropped them off to be washed and pressed at the dry cleaners in preparation for the wedding. They look so sharp!"
"I wear this under sleeveless things to cover my flabby upper arms.  You can tie it and wear it under your bra for this, or over your bra, don't tie it, wrap the tails around and safety pin them for a smoother look."
It's cute and functional but does require a separate credit card holder.
"These are very comfortable and I like them well, but next time I will get one size narrower. My mid-foot tends to slide around in these. I got the normal size that I wear in New Balance (4E) but these are a little bit wider than those."
"Looks so nice and my husband loves it. My husband figured out that it has a magnet, so he keeps it on the fridge so that he doesnt loose it and to keeo away from the kids.
I was skeptical because in the pictures I didn't think it looked very nice, but I am glad I went ahead and ordered it. It looks really nice, especially when it has money.
It is really sturdy."
"I am a devotee of Cuddl Duds. If you live in a cold climate, I highly recommend that you give them a try -- especially the pants. Tops are nice too but the pants are absolutely amazing."
I own these shoes in Black and Brown.  They are the most comfortable dress shoes I've owned in years.  When I am in them I am in them for hours on end and they are still comfortable.  I'll be looking to see if I can get a lighter color for Summer.  Worth every penny for this sharp looking shoe.
great insoles!
Mediums usually run big or perfect on me this one is a little snug. I've been trying to dress a little prettier for bed and this looked perfect. It's pretty and cotton but a little snug.
Very comfortable and true to size. The heel isn't too high which makes them good for a long wear. I love them
"I bought several pairs of these for a 3-1/2 year old I know and they are all adorable and nice quality.  This review is for the bird print leggings which are very unique and super colorful.  The fit is just what I expected.

This print matches the Fiream dress print which is one of the cutest dresses I have ever seen.  I think the birds on these pants are slightly smaller than the birds on the dress.

Very nice quality and they wash nicely without shrinkage or color loss."
Fit as expected. I'm normally a XL and the XL fits great.
Got it for my sister on her birthday . The fit is great . She loved it . Wished they had it petite size . Good dress in the afternoon for going out. As well as very comfortable fit. Liked it !
Warm and staying dry.
"Like the CK underwear, wearing a very comfortable, I like the brand"
"Light fabric and very warm, great for lounging"
"Fit perfect, no issues ."
"Very nice no show socks.  Also, made in Korea....which is good."
My daughter was about 2 1/2 months old when she wore this and it was super adorable! It was a little big but worked just fine. Material is thin so if it's cold can put something under it and if it's warm she won't over heat. I have to say though the hippo face doesn't stay up like it shows in pic and I had to do some adjusting so it didn't cover her face which made her mad.
Lightweight socks that don't bother my daughter. She has sensitive skin and narrow feet. She loves them!
"Very comfortable.  Not a great shaper for a C cup, however.  A bit of an unaboob!"
It's good and delivery ontime
"Love, just love it!"
Cool and sexy shoe. Comfortable too. But this weird thing happens occasionally while walking.. the tip of the shoe seems to catch the carpet every once in a while. I can't tell if it's just me or does anyone else experience this.. the shoe is so cute that I've been lifting my foot just a wee bit higher when I wear them cuz they are so darn cute! Fits good from heel to toe.. no overage in the front or back. I'm a true 9 and they fit perfectly
PenSee Rare Stainless Steel & Red Wood...; decent qulaity;  come as shown in picture
"came with really cute accessories also!
extra heel tips
gel pads
heel liners also
however
i did experience a problem with the strap. the holes for it are way too loose. there were inches inbetween the strap & my ankle. Ended up punching new holes to make the strap fit. This then left the strap so long it was almost on the ground.
Held up great in an out door wedding in the fall, rain and mud."
"these did the job I needed them to do, and they held up with all the rugged work required of me and held together in the wash. I was amazed the color didn't fade like it thought it would."
"They fit great, look great, and wash up great.  They still look good at the end of the day.  He stands, sits, walks on and off all day at work.  Cool for summer too.  These are his new pants for work.  If he wears khakis for something other that work, he likes these for that as well."
"I love this sweater! I'm 5'10"", 145 pounds and got a size 0-4 (S). I was worried about the sleeves being too short but they're perfect! Love the way it fits and the material is high quality. Will definitely be purchasing more colors in the future!"
Thanks you very much
I just received this bracelet two weeks early. Really good quality for such a low price.  Comes in a cute little pouch.  Buy extras because you're going to want to give them as gifts.
Feels so sexy on me... I'm a male that wears a 36-38 waist Jean.
Very good love it!!
This watch arrived very quickly and it works perfectly. I'm thinking about ordering more because it's the perfect size and you can attach it to any necklace or even a ribbon.
Definitely a must have for the studio!
They are nice .
"very well made, great colors, fast shipping."
My husband loves this shoe...always buys the same time when the old one gets worn out
Better than I expected. Very cute.
fvery comfortable and fits just right
will buy  again
The fit is perfect and they work equally well with jeans and evening wear. A great alternative to basic black.
"The colors are so vivid. The length is a little short for me, I like my dress below my knees. I am 5'4"" and 165 lbs. I got a size 12 it fit me just right just don't like the length. The material is not flimsy. Not too thick and definitely not thin like some dresses."
Perfect tie for my son.
I was surprised with the overall quality of this! The construction and material are better than the $8 price tag. It was shipped and delivered much sooner than the estimated time! It looks great on! I ordered an xl which it is a little big all over but not a big deal- 5'4 180.
"My daughter loves these shoes, especially because they light up. Perfect for summer fun!"
They were fine and fit all the guys well enough but they were a much lighter grey than expected based on the photos. Very very pale against white shirts.  Would not buy again.
"This outfit is so cute. I especially like the collar. Not much growing room for my grandson who is 7 months old, 20 lbs, and 30 inches long. I should have bought 18 months size."
These shoes are great these were my first pair I love them ! And i am a guy .. They did Fit me a bit big maybe like a finger space from my experience I would recommend just a .5 smaller that was the only down side there still holding .
They are light and comfortable.  I felt they did not provide as much arch support as I needed so I have added additional firm insoles for arch support.  Otherwise I am happy with my purchase.  I have had them for almost two months now and wear them daily.  Are they worth the money?  I feel they are made sturdier then some of the other brands like Nike or Adidas.  I will update my post as time goes on on the durability of these guys.
"After buying different brands of sized 36-inch waist pants, there seemed to be much variation in brand fitment.  I went with the 38-inch waist Haggar because several brands at 36-inch were too tight.  The Haggar seems to be a quality pant, but 38-inch waist seems to be on the large side for my fit, I probably would have liked a 36-inch waist in the Haggar brand.  That said, it seems other reviewers seem to find the length of the crotch to hip on the short side, and with this I tend to agree, making a 38-inch the better choice for my build.  The length of the 34-inch inseam is very generous, I'll probably need them hemmed.  I bought this pant for bowling as they are light weight to help keep me cool, and to meet dress code rules when bowling USBC tournaments."
"Super cute!  After a year of owning them the piece that attaches inside has broken, but the ears still stay up & look great!  It just sounds a little crunchy when you put them on.  My kids still wear them all the time."
just totally cool with a lot of quality thrown in to the mix
"Caution, the shirt is tapered and runs on the small side. Great looking shirt otherwise."
"After a week of breaking these in, I can say I love them. It's the perfect sandal for doing pretty much anything in the summer. If you try them and the bother your feet give them a fair chance after a week, and you won't be sorry. They're pretty complex to adjust at first, but once you get them set, they're fast. I can hike, do yard work, and even go to work in these. I love them!"
It fits my baby aclittle big but hes 4 months so bu the time its Halloween in a month my baby most likely fit.
"I noted ""fit as expected,"" as the reviews and manufacturer suggestion indicated they run small.  my ego prevented me from following that advice, so I had to return it; my bad!  having said that, I haven't given up hope -- I will work toward fitting into this item at some point, but i will say this corset is BEAUTIFUL, and beautifully made. ladies, if you are thinking about ordering this, pls be honest with yourself. save yourself that sting, if you know what I mean ;)"
"I think I ordered the wrong size. For the price, they are made well and I plan to order a size smaller."
The fit ran small. I did like the beautiful color!  I  got a compliment from a young lady .
I work in yoga pants so I ruin them very easily.  You can not beat these for the price!  They fit great not to short. I would have given 5 stars but they stretch out rather quickly as you wear them.
"Love that Crocs have finally come around to making attractive, non-""orthopedic"" looking shoes in the last few years. This style is even cuter in person/on.  Seems impossible, but they are even lighter than ""original"" Crocs. The plastic they use for this model (a bit jelly-like) is less sturdy than the harder plastic used on the ""original"" Crocs, but not unstable and still quite comfortable. Really like the matte translucency of the color. I have narrow heels/ankles; adjustment on the last hole seems to work just fine for me. The closure hook is easy but takes getting used to. An easy hose-down keeps them clean. LOVE my purchase! The lucky few of you who fit 8-9-10-11 get to pay $20 for them (unlike myself). ;)"
"A couple of things stood out to me with these - first the material is very thin/light (55% cotton, %45 polyester) which at first I was unsure about, but they are very comfortable, and time will time to see about durability. They are Hanes though, so I'm not too worried. The second thing that is new to me is the leg holes seem narrower than I'm used to. I'm thinking this helps keep things contained, which it certainly seems to. I thought it might limit mobility of my legs, but maybe only a couple times have I even noticed them. So all good!"
"This sandal fits a little too snug ; however I bought them to go to water parks ; therefore they are perfect for this.  They don't slip and slide off your feet when wet.  After you wear them a few times they fit better on your feet when dry.  At first they leave a small blister on your foot on the back strap ; but after you break them in they don't leave a blister anymore.  Kathy Castleberry, Tampa, Florida"
"The jumper is AWESOME!  I bought a small when I needed a medium, so I ordered the medium before I sent back the small because I needed it in time for my trip.  It fits nice and it is a nice quality material not lite, see through or cheap looking.  It is worth the money!"
I purchased it as a gift for a friend. I like the quality and feel but not sure how it fits him
Love it.. a little long on me at 5'4. I will buy more. It is comfy and modest but form fitting enough to be flattering.
"great quality, washed up nice, did not shrink, true to size!!!"
"Really great purchase! The tights are high quality, great colors, and the price can't be beat. Highly recommended!"
worth far more beautiful
"My grandbaby loves them, they are soft and fit great"
"Just go my dress in the mail, I'm 5'5"" 135lb and got the Small based on the chart. The dress came and its super cute, made out of a good thick material and stretchy too. The only thing is where the sleeve joins the body is cut a little large so you have a bit of fabric there but overall the dress is very comfortable. Perfect for fall or spring."
"Great! My husband loves having a mix of basic T-shirts, and these are good quality."
Good ole standard. I'm glad they haven't changed. Exact pants I've been buying in the store for more money.
Sending to my boyfriend in Afghanistan so he'll have something festive to wear for when they can celebrate Cinco De Mayo from overseas
This is the bag I've been looking for  big enough for everything but not so big it weighs you down. I will be buying more like this one.
I absolutely love it!! I'm going to wear it everyday
GREAT PRODUCT! I OWN ANOTHER CARHARTT BELT AND THESE ARE THE BEST BELTS I HAVE EVER OWNED!
"Love these for ultra-light packing! I purchased two of these after trying many other packing cubes of similar size, include smaller eBags. At first glance these seem tiny, and the fabric extremely thin. However when I stuffed them completely full, I was amazed at how much they hold! In just one of these small bags, I was able to fit a sports bra, 3 pairs of wool hiking socks, and 6 pairs of underwear. You can actually use them as a stuff sack, if you zip up the one size and place them on end. When stuffed completely full, I was still worried that the fabric or the seams would rip, since it is so thin. However after poking and prodding and stuffing them into my backpack in many ways, I'm convinced that they'll hold up. Also, the zipper seems well made and zips very smoothly. I will be purchasing the larger ones as well, since they add virtually no weight to my bag!"
Got this cap and some dog taps for my three year old grandson for Christmas. He loves them. It would be great if it had a Velcro strip in back to attach a name tape strip.
"My wife is very pleased with these beautiful, comfortable slippers. Attractive slip-ons are hard to find in this price range: these embarrassingly named Deer Stags Slipperooz represent excellent value for money--most highly recommended!"
"Beautiful boot. Too big (often a problem that I have with Doc Martens) and not the bright red color that I was hoping for so I returned them. But if you're looking for a dark cherry (more purple than red), these boots are gorgeous."
"I have a hard time finding pants that fit correctly and don't slide below my waist as the day goes on.  I have discovered that the best solution for me is pants with 7, not 5 belt loops and an expandable or comfort fit waist band.  Pants with those features are slightly snug around the waist when I put them on but comfortable and remain comfortable and in place throughout the day.  These Dockers fit those requirements perfectly.  I like the weight of the material and the look.  As I've aged and lost some height,  I've had to accept that I'm no longer a 32"" inseam and these pants in this color come in a 31"" inseam.  I only wish the 31"" inseam were available in more colors."
"funny smell but it seem high quality leather and its securely nicely woven, it looks and feels like it will last a long time. thank you WEST."
these fit 1 size small..... normally wear a size 7 but had to go to a size 8 just to get on.. 1/2 sizes not available... I understand the negative comments about the lining if worn everyday..
The pins are fine
Excellent shoe perfect for going from water to hiking.  Can be worn while trudging across the river as well as hiking rocky terrain. We bought them for the whole family. My kids play in these all day and they dry quickly.
"Fit as expected, great quality & price"
Used as a gift and the girl cried!
"Surprisingly comfortable all things considered.  Easy to attach to standard belt loops and of course, having no metal content, should allow me to walk through TSA.  Also easy to adjust while being worn."
Holding up great and perfect fit.
Arrived on time and fits perfectly and looks like the picture.
Pretty good shoes. I have different foot problems and was able to wear these for most of the day without any pain. The dark chocolate color is nice -- can be worn with with most suits that I own.
"Lovely cardigan. Nicely constructed, soft fabric and a beautiful shade of teal blue."
"My granddaughter is really forward to wearing these on her vacation . She is so excited for both. Pink, of course, is her favourite colour. Thank you for your prompt handling."
What can I say the hubby love them!! To me there are so freaking heavy I don't know how he walks in them but he says they are so comfortable on the inside it's like walking on pillows and they fit great.  He's been wearing them for work he is a repo man and needs them in case a car should fall on his foot or anything else.  They are very nice looking.  They look just like they do in the picture and seem to be a little cheaper here then in the stores.  Especially if you're prime and get them delivered for free.
Over all great quality looks great but slightly to small in going order larger size
Love love love this sweater. Nice quality for the price. Fits well. Super cute.
Wife thought it was cute
"Good price, good fit and they were shipped timely which is appreciated"
"These shoes are both stylish and functional. I use them for both lifting and roadwork, and they have held up for going on 5 months. The inside of the sole peeled pretty quickly after I started wearing them, but this is not a major problem.

Edit: I usually untie these shoes when putting them on/off. Today, I made the mistake of trying to don these while they were loosely tied. I crushed the back (this is the first pair of shoes where this has ever happened). After 5 or so minutes of tugging, it popped back into place and now works just the same as before. However, just a warning, don't use these as slip-ons."
I was scared it would be too small. I am 5'4. 180 lbs and very busty. Careful with the zipper it has mind of its own.
Fits large but you can adjust the back strap to push your foot to the center.
"My son absolutely LOVES these sneakers, and I do too!  Very well made and look great!"
The purse came on time and was awesome.  There was nothing wrong with it or any part of the order.  Very satisfied
"At EDC everyone seemed to have them but everyone still complimented mine!

Keep in mind they attach to a battery pack and wire that needs to be placed somewhere.  I had mine in my pocket but not every outfit has pockets."
"These shoes were a bit tight in the front when I first wore them but are comfortable now after a few times. They are also beautiful on the foot, the color looks great."
I absolutely love this bra!
"These are very quality sunglasses. I was skeptical of their authenticity because they are $60 less than what the Ray-Ban site sells them for, but they seem to be the real deal. I have a pair of wayfarers that were bought directly from Ray-Ban and they are pretty much the same in terms of quality lens and frame. These are great glasses for a great price!"
Fits well & comfortable!
i have bought these pants before and i love them. i am short hence the petite. the only  problem i see lately is the quality is not the same. it is made very thin and looks like it will not last as long as ones i have bought before but other than that its good.
Great PJ s
It fit just like the picture and has a lining. Same apricot as in the photo
Perfect for my son who is multi-handicapped and can't tie shoes.  He loves the velcro closure.
Absolutely ADORABLE!  Fits on my head just like it does with the girl in the picture..SO happy with this cute wool hat.
"But it was!  I bought this and all the other pieces available from this company! Frederick's of Hollywood while its my favorite store their stuff just doesn't work well with my body so I was looking for something else this is it, its wonderful and I love it! I have an athletes body so I am not a twig but this not only looked good but it actually accentuated what I have and is very flattering my husband loves it and he hates this kind of stuff."
"Prettier than expected.  Got them in both black and white.  Play close attention to reviews regarding size.  I am a size 4 with a 32B cup. 5'5"" I28 lbs and ordered Large because of the reviews. They fit perfectly."
They seem a little shorter than some I've bought in the past.
"I really like these! I was afraid the thicker sides would make them feel heavy, but they are very comfortable. The lenses are the perfect size for a smaller face. The price was great too! I would definitely recommend these sunglasses."
Very cute for the price.  Good bargain.
I like this piece
"I can see based on how much slack a button on a shirt has can stress these button holes on the plastic stay.  Overall I have used these nearly every day and love them when outside on a breezy/windy day.  Sure, the lower 1/3 to 1/2 may still flop around but that's acceptable to me.  However, I have a few ties that no longer have a complete tag loop on the back to allow these tie stays to work so I am also going to get a traditional tie clip preferablly a magnetic one.  The two items should be all I need.  But these work great!!!"
"I have the bronte lo boot by emu and decided to purchase these. the only problem is that I wear a half size and usually round down to the whole size but with this shoe I had to go up. The grey is great, absolutely love these so much, I went to the mall and purchased the black in the stinger mini. A++++++++++++++++++  As always amazon is awesome!!!!!!"
Needed something to carry I-phone 6+ when I do not have pockets.  This fits the bill.  The item arrived on time and exactly as advertised.
My daughter absolutely loves this dress is beautiful. It comes with a metal hoop. To make the dress look bigger around the bottom but it's removable. I haven't let her wear it yet so I don't know how she'll do with that but I can always take it out if she don't like it. Very silky soft.
"I just got this bra the other day and let me tell you , I'm so happy with this bra, its beautiful, fits really well, gives my 32dd's a great push up and im so happy that i got this and spent the money, i have the cheetah print one and i couldn't be happier with the design it is a great bra, better than i ever expected. Exceeded my expectations. i will be buying more"
Arrived quickly. Lots of room for boys with bellies. A bit too long. Hemming them today.
it was a little big to my liking. my fault didn't read description
"I never realized how cute crocs were till I started buying their flats/sandals. These sandals are both cute and and comfortable. I could wear them out casually or even with a more dressy outfit.
They are just a tiny bit big on me, but not enough to make them uncomfortable or slip off. It's actually kind of nice that their a teeny bit big because my heal doesn't rub up against the back.
I was most worried about the straps being too rough or cutting up my feet, but the rubber is flexible and soft.
Definitely going to buy these again when the time comes!!"
Most comfortable sports bra I have owned! Plan to buy addition items. Easy to put on and wash.
"This suit is beautiful!! I took one star because my lace is slightly bunched up in spot causing it to not lay flat. It is a bit short in the torso, but I have an average size torso and still have full enough coverage in the front to maintain modesty. Im a US 8, typically wear a large in swim wear, and the large in this fits well."
Very warm and comfortable.  More features than advertised and expected.
"I am very happy with this purse.  I prefer hobo bags and this one is just the right size.  It looks rich and the color is perfect ( the color in the photo matches the color of the bag).  It says it is leather but it doesn't have that ""leather smell.""  I question that but it does look like leather.  It has a different smell to it but it's not bad and it went away in a short time.  It may be the shipping wrap that they use.  It still does not smell like leather though.  What I really like is the lining.  It appears to be satin and it is sewn in very tightly and does not hang loose when I'm digging in the bag for something.  I love that!  There is plenty of room for just about anything you would want to carry.  I don't really need the extra long strap since the shorter strap is plenty long to go over my should and can be adjusted in length.  If you love hobo bags you will love this one!"
get one size bigger
A very nice basic and made well!
Perfect flip flop!! Would highly recommend
"Very responsive company to order from! Received this awesome shirt earlier than expected! Excellent quality! Not flimsy thin material, it's good quality and that is so appreciated, thank you!!"
look darling and very soft.. Fast shipping
This is SO SEXY! I'm So glad I purchased it! The price is amazing for the quality of the product. Why can't more Sellers do the same? They know darn well that their products are NOT worth the 800%-2000% markup...Thanks Camellias Corsets!
zzzzzzzzzz
Wish they still made these
My husband loves the watch .
"This is the second batch of capris I have bought in this brand and for some reason this new purchase is a bit more snug than the last. I like it, its thick material and fits snuggly."
"Fits well and is comfortable-no scratchy areas, very smooth."
I like it but it was alot smaller than i imagined. Oh well. Its still really clear and pretty I just wish it was alot bigger
"Gifted these to my mother for Christmas and they were the perfect fit (and gift). She loved them, they are super soft and comfortable, she wears them every day!"
my neice & i love them. I bought them as a gift for her but unfortunately not a good fit for her or me as well.
"Ok, ordered a large and it is definitely small. Not small enough I can't wear it as it was purchased for layering in the fall, but small enough I may have to sew some pretty lace onto the bottom. I'm 5'6 and about 140Lbs so if you're about that size, definitely order larger. All in all I would order again, top looks great and seems sturdy."
I love the cut and colour so much I wish there is an adult version!
It fit well. The material feels fine and looks really nice.
"Got these shoes for my lady, and she loves it. Came in good timing. We both love the colors and style. Only thing, is they didn't come with a box. Other than that everything was perfect"
"Love these shoes!!!
Soft insole and can wear them for hours... Very comfortable!!"
This is my 12th top from Patty Boutik great quality
These are superb! Soft and cute. I have ordered more in solid colors. Love them. need I say more? NO
"Fits as expected, but only bc I knew what to expect. I wear a 9 to 9.5 in most shoes, but an 8 in this flip flop. I wear a 9 in another Vionic flip flop style."
"Had this thing on my desk since I bought it and it holds an HTC One M7, wallet, knife, pen, and keys. The only drawback is that as phones get bigger and bigger, I know that the next phone I have won't fit so nicely."
"Lots of room. High quality materials.  Cute.  Comfy to carry.
Wish the magnetized middle section would stay closed."
"These are really light weight- a lot lighter than my last pair of Gucci's. The carrying case is also not too big- I'm very happy with my purchase-

JJ"
"I bought these as a gift for my dad, and they fit great! They cost the same as most stores, and they are exactly as pictured. I will continue to order these jeans for him in the future!"
I love it!! The chain is strong and it's a perfect length!
Cute neutral accessory purse for the price.
Mimi loved it! Said it was her very favorite gift she got for her birthday. She has worn it every day this week and it looks perfect. I read in another review that their's had only a sticker that read mimi. That wasn't the case for the one we received. No complaints here.
"I've been wanting a pair if red pumps for years and I've been eyeing this Michael Antonio pair for almost just as long so I finally purchased, and I'm so happy I didn't wait even one more day. These heels are HOT!! And they are a good height without being stupid tall (I swear some heels are made so extremely tall, I look like a baby giraffe walking for the first time).
I normally wear 6.5 so ordered a half size up based on other reviews. I probably would have been fine with 6.5, but now I have room for inserts so I'm not complaining!"
It's  not what I expected. I was thinking it was going to be a thick warm sweater and it is the opposite.
"It looks exactly like the one in the picture on Amazon. Gorgeous!! Super material of heavy cotton with a little stretch. and fully lined. Looks like a $200 DRESS! I'm 5'6"" and 112 lbs, very slender build and a S fits me perfectly. I'm glad I didn't go for a medium. I'm 32B in bra size and the dress fits snug around my chest, but I'm also wearing a padded bra underneath..It's kind of loose in the waist, but the beautiful belt that came with the dress took care of cinching the dress just right. The arm holes are a bit small, but my spaghetti arms fits them well. If you are on the heavy side bosom wise the dress in size S might be a bit tight. I have to order a whole bunch more of these beauties, especially the floral red and pink one. Shipping was about 8 days."
"nice product, great price"
roomy fit nice quality
The only thing is that they are tight at the thigh but they are great I love them
Great shoes.  My second ones.  Only advice is that if you don't need waterproof not to get the waterproof version as they tend to run hotter.  Nubuck seems to clean up from scuffs and remain casual/presentable for longer than the same finish in the non-nubuck version.  Second pair of Merrell slip-ons I've had.  I'll keep going with this brand.  Lots of convenient comfort for casual wear.
"Excellent pants!  Love the fit and the fabric. In fact, I like them so much I came back and ordered another pair!  I now have black, gray, brown, royal blue and red!  These are perfect!"
I got these for my wife and she didn't like the style
"Comfortable everyday shoez. Just exactly what I've expected. Usually I wear 7.0 but choose 7.5 fits as expected ,a bit big,but still is what I need. 5 deserved stars."
Loved it not that thick material really nice
Love the material and fit. Perfect for business casual.
"My boyfriend absolutely LOVES this ring. The design is so awesome and intricate. I gave it 4 stars because it's not exactly scratch resistant.. My boyfriend scraped it really bad after the first time going to the gym and picking up weights so as a result, he takes his ring off every time he's at the gym. Also, go half a size smaller than you expect. The overly smooth surface makes it really easy to slip off when in contact with water. It's pretty inconvenient that not only does my boyfriend have to take it off at the gym, but now also when he washes his hands or takes a shower just so he doesn't lose it. He doesn't complain though and says he wants his wedding ring to be modeled after this exact ring. He's happy; that's what counts most I suppose."
"As always, these are the best. My cats love these. Have bought them for years."
"love it, shipping a little costly but product is awesome"
"This is a good quality shirt.
Size is true.
Arrived within a week."
"The Color is gorgeous, as it is pictured, the Skirt is pretty and full with the ruffle on the very bottom.....The Fit is a little snug but works  ,( I wear a size 16 ) the Lining is a little smaller than the skirt so maybe that will keep it laying smooth around the waist and hips, anyway, I am pleased,  the length is perfect, I am 5 ' 7"" and it comes to mid calf or a little longer
I love it."
I ordered this tie for my husband to wear on our wedding day. Great texture and good quality material which makes for great value. I would definitely recommend it.
pretty cool socks.
Great quality material. Fits to size. Washed well. I buy several colors because they are my go to for quick sweater when the weather is chilly but not cold.
Very lovely anklet.  Just what I was looking for.
I have loved this style Rocket Dog for years.  They fit my somewhat wide-ish foot perfectly and I can be on my feet all day w/o problems.
This scarf is adorable and jewelry is good quality . I will buy more from this company.
I have always loved brooks
This is so perfect and I love it.
"Nice bikini panties, comfy,no muffin top thingy, but disappointed in the colors ,not as pictured"
"Pretty perfect. Was  concerned that it would be too tight around my big hips, but it wasn't.  It's really stretchy on the top part, and I think that the sizing chart is accurate as far as the waist and hips sizes these will fit. I got white and black, the basics.  I wear a size 18/20, for reference. I ordered size 2x and they are perfect.  I also have found them to be very wearable at work without being costumey because it's only a 2-layer crinoline, unlike many of the 5-layer fluffier ones you can buy. It gives all my rockabilly circle skirts and dresses just the right shape while still being functional to work in."
"Great seller, highly recommend."
Sturdy and stable.  I love them.
"It's a  little tight width-wise, but I've worn them since late spring and summer, and they're too hot for me to wear for more than a couple hours. Some water proof shoes are like that, but not all. I own other pairs and can wear them year round.

They have a nice grip though and appear well-put together, yet I only wore them a few times. They look good too, which is a subjective take."
"How sad is this... These are so nice, soft & comfy.  I bought white, gray and black.  I know myself so well.... I bought 2 pair of white knowing I would get something on them; had to make sure I had a backup pair!  LOL. Yes, well worth the money!"
Very comfortable & good for most chilly to cold days. Sporty & can wear anywhere.
I love this dress! It's perfect for my business casual office attire!
"I'm usually an 8.5 or 9 so when I order online I usually just size up.  I would probably rather have the 8.5, but not enough to send them back and exchange sizes.  Otherwise the shoes are perfect.  They are comfortable and very cute."
"For the price, this was a great shirt for a star trek event I went to.  For the price, this was a great shirt for a star trek event I went to."
Very warm.  Exactly what I expected.  Not so thick that you can't fit into your work boots or even your other shoes.  Not much more one can say about socks.
"Cute!! Love the olive green! Not see thru ! Looked a bit small upon arrival but surprisingly fit me perfectly, a Small as my usual size is 0/1, I'm 5'4 107 ib."
I find Fryes run a half size small. Shoe I wear 7.5-8m. 8.5 is perfect for me with Frye boots. Love this style. These are nice with skinnies to show the western feel (not too cowboy) and look classic with the slight rounded toe with boot cut. Best price on Amazon. I just saw these on another site for $174!
I like the cotton and like the colors offered. Good selection and well fitting sizes.
"I have a wide foot, between a c and d width. These boots fit perfectly! I could wear them all day. I do agree they need some cushioning so buy some insoles. For someone, like me, with a hard foot to fit, they are a lifesaver and soooo cute!"
These are size 14 but runs true to size unlike any other puma sneakers.  This is our second purchase of the same line (BMW MS Nyter).  Actual color is navy blue.  Happy with this purchase.
"They are so cute, every time my kids wear them people ask about them"
"I like these and I like them more as time goes on. They look contemporary but are comfortable like old lady stretch pants ( and I am nearly an old lady so I can say that!) Love the waistband, it gives a nice smooth look under tunics and long tops. Look good with ballet flats or kitten heels. I'm probably going to stay with this brand for a while and get some more pairs. By the way, I forgot and put them in the dryer, and didn't have any problem with them shrinking."
"Flexible, comfortable, non-slippery, non-marking. I am using them for training at home or in the gym. They are supper light. I think it would be possible to wear them without  socks since they are build that way although I don't see/feel anything wrong wearing low cut ones."
Very delicate and stylish. Can wear every day or on special occasions. Seems like it will endure the test of time.
Very comfortable shoe very good material. Runs just the right fit you don't have to run a size bigger or smaller
Nice! Friends love colors.
"These are the best fitting jeans I've ever owned. I was a little worried about how the color would look, but they look really good. Someone else said they were more like bell bottoms than bootcut, but they are definitely bootcut. The denim is soft and has a slight stretch and it seems to be good quality too. I had to wear a belt, but at least the waist wasn't super tight."
Love them. I really like the round cut ones. Wear them all the time.
"When ordered was not sure if this was what I wanted. Received it promptly and it appeared to be as advertised. Size, length, material and fit were all acceptable. After the first washing the material softened and became one of the most comfortable robes ever."
"I love this look and feel of this dress.  I've received many comments on it as well.  My ""general"" size is 12w.  This dress is an XL.  It's slightly larger than I need, but it's very comfortable and the belt keeps it from looking baggy."
"My favorite watch, love it. evrybody comments on it."
"it is not mine , i bought it for my friend as a gift,, she likes it and said it did fit,"
"Lightweight and comfortable, these are perfect for summertime! I got the 8"" so that they weren't too short, and that length is perfect. I'll probably purchase 2-3 more of this style in different colors."
My daugther loves the ballerina shoes.
this dress is super cute.  Can dress it up or down.  I actually ordered it again in another color.
"I have several pairs of crocs and always wear a size 10. But for some reason the right foot of this pair is Snug across the straps going across the top of my foot. The shoes over all are attractive, it's feels stable to wear, and the buckle system is unique and easy to use. Crocs always have that lovely cushy sole for your foot to rest on and is very comfortable.  My only complaint is the straps are tight on 1 foot."
"Absolutely adorable costume! I bought a 12-18 month for my 7month old girl and it was too snug by the time Halloween came around but we made it work. She was 20lbs, 26"" at the time."
Superb. Better than. I thought
The fabric on these boots is insanely soft! They are beyond comfortable as well! I was able to wear these for a full 8 hour shift the first time I wore them! Great quality!
"Very warm, light, well made boots. They run slightly big to the size. But boots shouldn't be too tight and I wear with insoles so I am happy with this size.(size 8. I wear 8 or 7 1/2)
Great value. They came on time by Fedex. I think Fedex is better than UPS, they sent me the notice of arrival on the actual arrival day."
I love this and the support it gives me while wearing my breasts when I cross dress.  Definitely will buy again.
Just returned today.
These are nice hard bottom shoes that add a little flair with the strap. These shoes seem to scuff up easily. I don't recall bumping into anything and by the time I got home the shoes were scuffed up all over. Nothing a little polish can't handle but still.
Love the group! Makes a great way to keep things in one place instead of all over- as I had been...
My daughter is a huge Dr. Who fan and this cardigan is really cute!
These worked great for packing and organizing everything from a carry on suitcase to a larger size.  They need to be aired out when you first get them too.
"Hav not played golf wearing these shoes yet but look forward to doing so soon. They r very lightweight, comfortable nd good looking shoes. They come with an extra pair of color contrasting laces, not a huge deal but nice"
"Took off a star because my right foot heel slips and had to put in a heel grip, which is strange since my right foot is my bigger foot.  Cute, comfortable  with good arch support.  I got a 8.5M which is my usual size for enclosed toed shoes, but seem just a bit on the narrow side, which luckily for me my feet are closer to narrow than wide."
Great top to wear in the hot summer months.  The material is cool to the touch and feels wonderful on.
I love my Mary Jane. My size didn't fit but the larger size did fit and they are so classy and original. A must buy and great appeal.
Fits great. True to size.
I managed to get everything I need including cash and license in this very small case.  It is my all time favorite for when I just want the essentials.  I even have a small pen refill with tape around it for case and some cc sized blank note paper in it.
"Love the bag. The inside (this one has the permanent insert) is made well.  The bag is huge and sturdy.  Would have given 5 stars, but the bottom of the bag has 4 little ""feet""- half round plastic bits to protect the leather. I've used the bag for 1 week and the fake silver came off to reveal the white plastic. A nicer purse would have real metal, but for the price I will happily live with it. Not often somone inspects the bottom of my purse :)"
So comfortable. I'm tall and the they are still slightly long which is perfect for me. Highly recommend.
"Soft and comfortable, great color! Excellent quality!"
"What a great al around shoe for everyday use. I simply can't believe how comfortable just a plain long shoe like this can be. I applied some spray scotchgaurd waterproofing and now I'm ready for winter... Now these shoes don't have fancy insole supports and stuff but they are very comfortable, make me wonder about all those crazy expensive shoe designs, God does a pretty good job of designing feet !!  :-)"
"This Skirt is Beautiful. Came in very nice package and the Feathers are authentic Peacock feathers very beautiful. Has a inner lining that makes it wearable without slip. The flowing design is wearable anywhere. Will love Dressing up in this and Feel as tho I have on a Gown.  It is very well Sewn and would be lovely matched with just a Tee shirt and still Look lovely. The Material is Soft and Silky and Wash should be by Gentle COLD Water only and Hand Wash if possible. and Line dry only.

I received this product at a reduced price for my honest and unbiased opinion."
"I love this costume. It arrived on time and fits and looks great. I purchased M, which is my regular size. I am 5.5, 155 pounds. It says on the label ""fits 10-14"" which would not be true, but it should fit American 8-10. My chest is 75C and the top is slightly tight but not critically. Got it for an awesome price too. Very happy!"
One of the best Golf Shoes Made.
This sandals have held up great all summer long with my little boy!! Lots of splash pad visits and stomping through muddy puddles :)  I plan to buy these again next year for another fun summer!! Totally recommend for an active toddler!!
"Great walking shoes.  Fit perfectly and are very lightweight.  I use them to walk my dog for about an hour a few times a week, and my feet and legs feel great when I get home."
It's a great jacket. I got it on a sale with free shipping in my size. Saved almost 40$
"I bought them for my dad, who uses a hearing device & they fit perfect!"
"Beautiful wedding set.  Runs a little small, but still fits.  Nice every day piece of jewelry, would recommend.  Reasonably price.  Has lots of sparkle."
"So glad I purchased these.  I ordered a set from another seller (they came with a small, medium and large cube)  They were fine, but the large size, was smaller than the large from this seller.
They are longer and wider than the other set.  I really needed this larger size.  I love, love, love these.  They are going to make travel so much easier, packing my clothes with these cubes."
My Dad really loved this set.
Great classic chucks at a steal of a price. Cant beat it.
A little small in shoulders n but other than that fit good.
"Great suspenders!  Large color selections.  The fastening clips are well built, well designed and fasten well also. The location and design of the back fasteners are right on the money.  Suspenders have good adjustability too."
"typical Levis, good jeans, should last for a long time"
Will definitely recommend it
"Tiny bit large, but I think one wash will fix that. Very nice fabric."
"Very warm, soft, and packable.  Good fit.  Very happy."
"I bought this shirt for my husband. He has two other PGA TOUR shirts in different colors and they are his favorites. This one is no exception; now he has three favorite shirts! Consistent size, quality."
I don't know why I didn't buy these ties before. They are very stylish.
Tight fit but very flattering
"I bought a medium and I think they are a little see through, but I am also 23 weeks pregnant so I'm sure they won't be as see through when I lose a little weight. Over all nice"
Daughter loves the look of them BUT they do run a bit narrow & a little more cushion. I'd opt for 1/2 size up & add inserts. Worth the price even with modifications.
Exceeded my expectations. Adorable and very nicely done.
Got this for my husband and he loves it! He shows it off and is never without it. Gives him security and is worth purchasing if your hubby can't help breaking the aluminum ones due to overstuffing!
My son out-grew the boiler room suit
"Bought for my 14 year old son for trip to snowy area. Love how it looks and fits! He loves it, too! Not overly heavy, but very warm. Great!"
Good Novelty Item!!
"bought for daughter birthday, she is pleased with them"
"I love these pants, They are made great. I wear a size 14 and I ordered a 14, fits fo good. I am buying a couple of more."
"Muy buenas y bonitas, son muy cmodas!, hay que comprar una talla mas, porque son de horma pequea.  Excelente. las recomiendo!"
Exactly as shown. Quality material
Bought this as a gift and it was well received.
I normally wear a size 9 and these are 8 1/2-9 so they are a little on the small side.  This is the second pair that I have ordered because I LOVE them!  Great for summer...they do stretch out a bit.  I would definitely order them again.  They are great for summer....and great for rainy days....
"I love this Boot 'cos its light and feels confortable when i wear it, the soul is just too sweet."
Nice quality shirts.  I have been buying them for years.  The colors are usually true to what is shown online.
"I needed a hat for a Mary Poppins event and didn't want to spend a lot of money.  This had came relatively fast, considering that it was shipped from China.  It was folded up, yes, but the creases smoothed out after I shaped it.  I added flowers to it and it worked great.

I was going to give it to the thrift store, but never got around to is.  Which was fortunate, because my next costume - I HATE costumes! - was as a little old lady from ""Arsenic and Old Lace,"" so I plopped it onto my white hair and it worked great, again.

I still have it - ya never know.

I""m sorry some didn't smooth out.  MIne did.  And the price was certainly right."
"Nice sandals, just too big so I returned them.  Good service."
I bought this adorable costume for my 2 1/2 year old girl who wears size 3 and it fit perfectly.  Quality is good.  Best of all she loved it!!
"Love the wallet, bought this one but was damaged so returned it and got the same one in black.  Great easy to carry size. Lots of card storage. Love it!"
This t-shirt looks better in person than it does in this picture.  It's really cool and you don't need to be a Big Bang Theory fan to appreciate it.  I got it as a gift for a teenager and he loved it!
THEY ARE THE BEST I HAVE BROUGHT
"I'm 4'11"" and 90 lbs and this dress in XS was the perfect fit. It is my boyfriend's favorite dress on me by far and it only costs $15- I'll take it! I've purchased this dress in both wine red and grey and love them both."
"This is super cute, but why does it seem like all rain coats have very short sleeves? They are long enough but the sleeves are always too short for my kid... perhaps she just has extra long arms I don't know haha"
Looks great with denim
Good shoes and very comfortable!
Its exactly what I was looking for
Had screen print logo put on here for my business and everyone loves it. looks sharp and feels great
"These are great pants, good fit, second time I've gotten this type.  Without the front pockets, it seems the pant fits better"
This worked great for our middle school production of The Wizard of Oz!  Very good quality hat for the price.
Ha!  Bought these for my Lab.  She loves to play tug-of-war.  They were perfect.
"So far so good - using it for Studio Circuit Training Classes.  Providing alot of cushioning and support, especially for lateral moves and heel impact moves.  It also breathes very well for a gym shoe."
"I had been wanting these shoes for a while and when I found them for such a great price I decided it was time to purchase them.  They arrived very quickly and on time of course.  The fit was perfect, but I did do some research on Converse sizing before I purchased.  I am glad I did because it's recommended to go about half a size down which is what I did.  I am very happy with the shoes and the seller."
It really keeps u warm...
"Perfect, haven't taken them off since I arrived."
"Maybe not as fancy as the more expensive ""active"" underwear but not as pricey either. I like them just as much as my Duluth Trading ""Buck Naked"" boxer briefs."
"Great maternity tank, good for laying around the house but also nice enough to wear out."
Look great and feel really comfortable. Great value and look exactly as depicted in the advertising photograph.
Daughter loves these nylon mesh shorts.  The graphics are great.  She loved them.
"I ordered these so you would no longer see my bra straps when I wear mt tank tops some of them have an odd shape I just had rotator-cuff surgery so my wardrobe for a while will be tank tops.  They work wonderfully, they are very comfortable and they do help with your posture.  My sister has stolen 2 of them I am very happy and so is she I highly recommend these!!!!"
Great bag. Deducted one star because of color. Most baggallini beach colors appear much lighter and subdued (both exterior and interior). Exterior is more brown and interior is hot pink. But it gets the job done.
Omg absolutely beautiful
Bought these for my daughter for her homecoming event and they fit great looked beautiful with her amazing dress. She wore them all night with no complaints and the next morning her feet were not sore. Great classy heels.
Great suit!  I'm really happy with my purchase.
"I bought this type of item a few years back from this company and it was GREAT! I see the price went up and the material is not as bullet proof, but it's ok for some motorcycle riding in the winter."
"It seems to be made of real leather and of a single piece, not the cheap layered kind glued together. A little long. I bought an extra large for my 34-36 inch waist and it is maybe 2-3 inches longer than I need. Definitely better than anything I have found off the rack for twice as much."
This dress is soooo beautiful!!  The quality is excellent!!
Love these! Very nice material. It feels strong (not cheap) but also very comfortable. Fit nicely. A tiny bit longer than expected but I love the way I look in them! Arrived super fast too! A lot sooner than expected.
"I've purchased a few of these type of belts and the combination of the buckle and the thickness of the belt itself is the key to how smoothly this is going to work for you.  And this one...is PERFECT!

Plus, because it slides in and out of the buckle instead of  having to be pulled like old fashioned belts, it doesn't wear almost at all!

I love this belt and I can't imagine anyone not feeling it's the best belt they've ever used!"
I LOVE Freya and this bra is probably my favorite. The J-hook is a major bonus to a great bra!
Very nice color and fabric but the Large is too large in my opinion. I wear a size 14 and its too big on me.
"These two necklaces will make a wonderful Christmas gift for my two Grand Daughters.
The Angel Fish necklaces are beautiful, and the girls will love them."
"I really like the idea of this product, and it functions exactly as it's designed to.  I considered that it fit me very well, and it was comfortable but it turned out to be a little too tight over the bust and caused painful blocked ducts when I wore it.  I am holding on to it in the hopes that I will be able to wear it in a few months without difficulty.  Similar products are available in Europe which hook over your shoulders but sit just under the bust and just cover your belly - I haven't been able to find anything like that in the States.  That would be my perfect solution."
Great color and decent quality!
Bought these for a friend. She says they fit great and feels as good as going barefoot!
Fits perfect.  I ordered a L/Xl which is my usual size.  Very soft and lightweight.  (Not warm for winterwear) I really like it.
Loved this dress but had to return as it did not fit my body well and showed all the imperfections and love handles. Otherwise would have been great
"I like this shoe.  I did have to re-lace the shoes, as the lacing it came with seemed backwards to me and was very difficult to tighten.  The shoes do NOT scuff as easily as I feared, so that is a big plus.  They are doing very well with some hard wear once a week.  I bought them a bit big, and they started off fitting about like I expected (I like to get as much wear as possible from the 'good' shoes).

I'd definitely get these in a larger size when the time comes."
Love them! So comfy and so warm. Fit exactly as expected.
Fits my 1.5 year old perfectly.
Great experience. Fast shipping.
I just walked a couple of miles on these and will get more. These are like the old Saucony shoes I haven't found recently. They have good cushioning and are light and vented for summer heat. I usually wear a 9M in street shoes and the 9 1/2M is perfect.
"I have to buy mens wide sneakers, b/c of my bad foot. The sneaker is very comfortable & wide enough not to irritate my bad foot."
"My daughter wore this as part of her Halloween costume this year.  I was hoping to remove the ribbons, but they are permanently attached.  The quality is very good especially for the price.  The wig is on the small side. It just fits my daughter and she has a small head. I doubt she will be able to wear it next year."
"Shipping was SUPER fast... Especially considering it came from overseas. I normally wear a small, but I got a medium and it fits perfectly, so size up for the best fit. Overall very cute and exactly what I was looking for!!"
"Wonderful, comfortable bra"
"These boots keep my feet warm and dry, even when I need to be outside for extended periods of time, or if they are wet or submerged in snow."
"Love this infinity scarf. Have used it regularly since receiving. I get compliments on it frequently, and the scarf it self is thick and so soft!"
Nice cleat.  Comfortable straight from the box to the field.
These are the only shoes my daughter will wear.
"buy alot of them go a size smaller i wear a large and got a medium because they stretch out, after like 20 mins of wearing them ,"
ordered wrong cup size...
"Love the bangle, looks very nice"
"They run a little big on me (med) and they have a shiny finish which I am not thrilled with, but they are very comfy and I have worn them a few times and they are good quality."
The thigh and leg area fit well. The stomach area was a little tight. I am in an exercise class and hope to wear them in the summer!
Thank you Brother Jeff # Soldiers in CHRIST United
Great shorts!  Plenty of pockets with well designed flaps to secure what you have in them.  They fit just like the long pants with all the same features.
"It's almost summer! That means that it truly is sandal time!  These sandals fit true to size. I wear a size 7 and I have really high arches. A size 7 in these sandals fits me perfectly. They are comfortable. I love the way they fit. I love the way my high arches feel in these comfy flip flops.

So...this is a great sandal to wear around the house or at the beach or at the pool."
"I got this matching set as a gift from my husband. We are using these as an alternative to wedding bands, as his job isn't the best for rings. They are beautiful and unique. I am very happy with them. The ""I love you"" bean was a cute little surprise."
"My second watch like this. Its pretty, but the stones eventually fall out. Still it works well."
"My five year old loves them, they fit well and she wants to wear them all the time."
I love these shoes!  one downside is the footbed is lined with slippery material that makes my foot slide while walking!  I am looking for insteps or something that keeps my foot from sliding in them.  beautiful gold logo and classy shoe!
"Very good quality sterling silver, not flimsy or light weight.  Put it on and received two compliments in one day!"
It looks much more expensive than it is.  Husband loves it!
My daughter loves these for middle school track. SO much cheaper to purchase online. The spikes are great and she has done well in these shoes. Great purchase.
"I love these sandals. They are so comfortable and stylish. I wanted something a little different than a flip flop and these fit the bill. I put them on and didn't want to take them off. They really do feel like your walking on yoga mats. I need more colors. I have received numerous compliments and they go with anything, jeans, skits, shorts. I throw them int eh gym bag to wear after a hard workout. I don't slide in them either."
"I have the hardest time finding well fitting bras.  Because of this, I like to try them on first so I usually go to regular stores to do this. I decided ""what the hell, I'll order some bras on Amazon."" I tried this one and it fits pretty well!! It is well-made and everything feels well supported. Beware though, I think the band size runs small,  but it happens to work for me. I am somewhere between a 32 and a 34 and I am wearing this on the largest notch."
"Excellent denim men's shorts, wears well and looks great."
"A little more sheer than I thought they'd be, but the leggings are super comfortable. Just have to wear a longer shirt or tank top with it."
"Good quality but the ears are not bendable , they are glued to the hat. I got lots of laughs wearing it at work on easter"
Not a true mock turtleneck.
Very beautiful! The comfort fit is nice. The engraving is lovely!
nice as described for the seller
Very good support with great comfort. I did add arch support foot petals because I have very high arches and suffer from plantar fasciitis but with these shoes I can walk in comfort. So happy with them I bought an pair.
"Tight, smooth, and crinkle at the ankle."
"Looks adorable, nice lightweight pjs for spring.

Updated: Might be made from magic. I'm not sure what exactly these pjs are made of or where they get the material but I'm convinced there is magic in these. My child is almost 1 and he almost never sleeps through the night. He's usually up once or twice a night because he's hungry, teething, or had a bad dream and needs a quick snuggle. These somehow make the tiny human dictator happy and he sleeps through the night in these. I'm ordering more right now."
"I had read several reviews of Sbicca shoes prior to buying these, and some of them were a little varied.  For the most part, people liked them, though, so I decided to take a chance, and these were on sale.  I'm so glad I tried them!
I love these shoes.  They're cute and look great with a casual skirt, shorts or jeans.  The first day I wore them, I couldn't believe how comfortable they were.  They don't rub me anywhere, and the heel height compared to the platform height makes them easy to walk in all day.  Plus, I got several compliments on them.  Almost everyone who commented on them talked about how cute they were, and how comfortable they looked, too and I""m in total agreement.
I'm adding Sbicca to my list of favorite shoe brands!"
Love it. Very comfortable. Washes well.
"THIS WAS THE FLEXFIT HAT AS ADVERTISE
FIT GREAT.... I HAVE A BIGGGG HEAD....
WELL MADE"
"My SIL loves these boots wears them whenever posible because after all they are Fryes, who would not. Not my thing, however younger people than me will love them"
"what more can i say?  these are soooo comfy that i don't want to wear anything else.  i've had them about a month and they still seem to be in great condition.  i was a bit wary because some people complained that they fell apart, but mine are holding up great."
This coat is so cute on my 1 5month old daughter.  The furry part is very soft and the hood stays on nicely. She loves wearing this coat.  Nice fit.
Nice High visibility...
Perfect leggings for the gym!
Perfect to wear under my dresses and skirts so I don't have to wear panty hose.
It looks very nice. The material is not very soft actually little coarse. Its still nice as all sleepwear for kids is cartoon stuff so this change is welcome.
Quite big. My little one loved it. It fits  books nicely and the pockests are great for nicknacks and other stuff. Great material easy to clean.
This is a great skating skirt- it's also good for our school uniforms. It does fade pretty quickly- something to keep in mind. Very comfy.
This Doctor Who necklace is so realistic. My niece who is the ultimate doctor who fan just loves it. She wears it almost everyday.
Great material. Love the pockets. Absolutely no stretch in the waist of the black and white floral print. I am about a size 14 and the waist was tight but I made it work :)
"These are my favorite jeans, the fit is perfect and so is the length."
The colors & print are very nice.  It washed & dried very well.  My boys like them very much
"Beautiful, warm boots! I live in northern Wisconsin where you need to keep your feet warm just for everyday activities, but I was tired of clunky, ugly footwear. These were the perfect choice. The gray/brown combo goes with everything and I like that they don't have a lot of fluffy fur like so many boots I looked at. The fit is shoe-like, not heavy or clunky, but there's still room for heavy wool socks when needed. I can comfortably tuck in regular or skinny jeans too. I was a little nervous about lace-up boots, but the speed laces at the top make them fairly easy to take on and off. **Update: Still loving these boots after two seasons of wear. I get lots of compliments on them! I live where Uggs are the standard fare for everyday winter wear, but these are unique."
"I received such amazing compliments for this top at work! Free, float, loose and breathable, you'll ffel scandalous like you're hardly wearing a thing. The layers are great, and doesn't require any additional under layers. I'm definitely getting a different color!  Remember to size up for the flowy feel!

I'm 5'3, 160lbs,  and a large fit perfect. It's even a bit loose where it sits on the waist/hip."
"This is very, very pretty.  I sent it back because I wear between an 8 and a 7.  I may reorder it and see if I can get an insert for the 8 so it fits better.  I really enjoyed looking at it.  Beautiful color - it looks like alexandrite not a sapphire which I think is a good thing."
Love this bag I always get compliments on it !!
I have these sandals in nearly every color-great fit & support.
had plenty of khaki over the years..  always had to cut and make new cuffs.  this is my first blk pairs....
Solid leather belt with no frills.
Very happy with this very comfortable set of sleepwear.  Would buy again and again.
"These are perfect! I love the ""infinity edge"" at the leg opening, no band means no sausage leg effect. The waist is high enough to shape but stops at the natural waist so I don't have to pull it all the way up under my bra like most panty hose. The fabric is slick enough that pants do not become hung up or clingy. They pull on nicely, have a nice smoothing effect and are comfortable, not constricting. (I wear 2x pants but ordered the 3x shaper) The nude color is perfect too - completely no-show under white pants. LOVE them."
Best astronaut costume we found!
Kept everything organized and folded.  There was no rummaging through suit cases. Buy different colors for each person.  At first I thought they looked small but this size was good for Capri pants folded in half and jeans in thirds.
"These wool boot socks are very nice! They seem to be of good quality, and are thick enough to provide some warmth, but not too thick so as to be uncomfortable. I got the gray ones, and they really should go with almost any color outfit. I am about 5'4"", and these fit me great. I actually think they would fit lots of heights fine...I wanted mine to fit just at the knees to peek out above my Hunter boots, so I just scrunched these down a tad and they looked great. I'm not sure if I will be able to wear these on bare legs, because they are a little bit scratchy, but mostly I'll be wearing them over stretch pants anyway so it won't be a problem. They do feel pretty soft, though. Only one thing is iffy about these...it looks like there might be some thread ends that may unravel around the knees, but I'm not sure yet if this will pose a problem, so I won't take off a star for it. Overall, very nice quality. I did get these at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review. All of my words are my own."
"I was apprehensive about the size after reading previous reviews. Some said too big, some said too small. Hard to determine size based on feedback.  Mine fit me just right, ordered a 10 1/2 and they fit just fine.  Quality is great. Boots are comfortable. Very happy with my purchase."
"The image for the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Haggar-Men-s-Regular-Fit-Poplin-Pattern-Dress-Shirt/dp/B00GBVNTG4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Haggar Men's Regular-Fit Poplin Pattern Dress Shirt</a>&nbsp;looks to me like a pajama top, but the shirt is much nicer.  The white lightweight blend poplin has slate blue substantial stripes which contrast well, giving it a very crisp impression.  The collar is a little more dressy than a button down, and with the enclosed removable plastic collar stays to keep the fabric put, it can be worn with or without a necktie.  Having a rounded cuff keeps the fabric from fraying as easily as otherwise, and it is closed by using a single button.  There are two on the cuff, so you have the ability to have it looser or tighter.  All stitching was done well and the bottom side seams have a nice little curved piece of fabric sewn in.

I like very much that the bottom button is stitched in blue thread and its buttonhole is also in blue.  This is a cute accent that seems almost like a secret.  The fit is average and because the fabric is thin and white, if you are shy, it's probably smart to wear a t-shirt underneath.  It is a great shirt for hot climates.  This is a very nice shirt and well worth the cost."
Good fit and style
"Be sure to order these boots 1/2 to 1 size larger than usual.  They run a little small, but are super cute and sexy!  They are comfortable for several hours but not if you plan on walking all night."
Nice.  Good quality.  Looks like they will hang onto their shape.
great good
Theyre somewhat large but reminds me of a pair of boyfriend sweatpants so I love them either way. But I was expecting them to be more form fitting as depicted in the photos.
looks just right!
Awesome!! Colors are bright and it fit right.
Took a long while to get to me but love  this clog ( wish the other colors were still available) beautiful and comfortable plus came with a cute storeage bag !
My husband has been searching for a sneaker he can slide on and off easily when in the house. When I saw these on Amazon I ordered them and he really likes them. They are comfortable and they look great.
I like this sweater but it stretches out very quickly after a few hours of wear.  Regardless of this it is still a very nice sweater and the price was even nicer.
"Comfortable and stylish. Feels like good quality, the strings loose at the bottom back are obnoxious but worth dealing with for ne. I'm a size 10/12, 5'10"" and a Large fits comfortably."
Good looking watch. It appears to be much more expensive than actual cost. The face is a good size and easy enough to read. the band is a good quality leather and is comfortable. If this last as long as my other Casios it will certainly be a good value.
"I'm 5'9"" tall with a rather large tummy. This dress/top is slimming and super attractive.  Quality of fabric and manufacturing is perfect."
I originally ordered a size 7 because reviews said to order a size down. Too small; returned them and got my regular size 8 and they fit perfect!
"These are comfortable cotton blend pants.  If you are looking for something with spandex to help hold your figure, these are not for you.  They show every curve.  They are not tight and don't cling to you.  They are 57/37% cotton/polyester and only 6% spandex.  They work well for my needs - working out and dance class."
Levis rock!
I love this bathing suit topper! I have worn it as a dress over a tank top with leggings. Very cute.
"beautiful ring, but at time did not have correct size for my husband"
"Wonderful bright HOT PINK color! It's just enough fluff, for a grown woman's tutu. It stands out rather than down! Just the way I wanted it. And it comes in one size fits all. and fits perfectly! I am no skinny Minnie! and it fits me fine!"
"Super cute, just like the picture. Nice soft, quality material. 5'6"" 180lb, and the medium is perfect. Arrived very fast! Going to order another color."
Used this for a color run and it was really cute and fit perfect. I even threw it in the washer and dryer after and it came out perfectly fine.
Super sexy and very comfortable.
"Fantastic solution for my bras, until they stretch more. No suffering to dress them anymore."
"I love this bag! I've had a number of them over the years. They sturdy but light, and look good."
"I only buy this style of Salomon as it fits my foot and gait perfectly, sizing is consistent.  Wear for every day and for nursing."
"These are my second pair - I also have the taupe color.  I'm a professor and need a sensible shoe that looks good with pants or dresses.  These fit the bill and are super comfortable.  I have big feet (11 W) and I've found these fit true to size and have good support (for a flat).

I was a little late ordering when the fall styles came out - but was so glad to find my size/width in black here on amazon."
Dansko shoes are the best that I have ever bought. Your formula for quality and comfort cannot be beat.  Thanks.
These offer my foot great support. They were just what I needed after fracturing my foot.
It is very beautiful and sexy. It is look like the picture exactly.  I love the pink bar and the shiny tiger . It is brand new.
"These were true to size and very comfortable.  They keep my feet warm, without making them sweaty.  I am able to wear them outside to get the mail without having to worry about the bottoms getting worn out.  Although I will be putting them away soon as the hot temperatures are arriving, I look forward to using them when fall and winter are here.  Arrived on time, and will buy again.  I am very happy with this product."
"I don't know where to begin.
Let's see...
I see a lot questions and comments regarding the manufacturing of Manitobah Mukluk (MM) products. Just FYI, like any high output manufacturer, MM does outsource. Specifically, in MM's case, to China. And some of the components are sourced from Australia. That said, yes, some of their products are still made exclusively in Canada as well.
You can check MM's website and the styles that are 100% Canadian made have a red maple leaf on their listing to signify as much.
Either way, the Manitobah Mukluk website clearly states ""International Production"" on the products that applies to. Nothing tricky or deceptive.

Now, on to the boots. *sigh* '
The design is just my style. Before I first purchased a pair of these many, many years ago, I was so excited for them to arrive that I was showing the pictures of my anticipated purchase to everyone.
No one seemed to think much of them. And some people even said they thought they were ugly.
That is, until they saw these babies on my feet in person!! LoL
Everything about them is great in my opinion. I love that there are no laces or zippers. I just slide my foot in or out of them with no hassles. The structure of the shaft and the leather are sturdy enough that the boots don't slouch excessively. Manitoba Mukluks are the type of boots that look great on skinny legs; at the same time, are wide enough to fit and look even better on big[ger] calves. '
Beautiful quality leather; very thick yet supple. The color is vibrant. The etched detail/design is lovely but not overbearing.
The lining in the shaft is faux fur. The footbed is plush, non-removable, natural shearling and does get worn down but it's a quick and easy fix to order new shearling liners and slip them on top of the existing footbeds when need be. The Vibram soles are the absolute best. Flexible and they move naturally with the movement of your foot. Not restrictive at all. It's like being barefoot without the nuisance of feeling the objects underfoot that would otherwise be sharp or painful if you actually were. Do be advised, though, that if you require arch support, you'll need to purchase accordingly because these are completely flat. Luckily, I don't have any issue of that nature and these are, by far, the warmest and most comfortable shoes I own. So much so, I have 3 pairs in varying colors. ' ' ' And I always have my eye out for new pairs. I'd wear them everyday if I could.
I've worn them in snow in the dead of winter. I've strolled in them in the rain. They have definitely held up in all types of weather. I've heard people say that these, like any inclement weather shoes, should be waterproofed with a silicon--or a similar--all weather spray. But I've never done that. And my feet have never been cold or wet in these boots. Ever. ' To their credit, these boots have held up for years. Soles, leather and all. To this day, I get compliments and stares every time I wear them--which is often. LoL

What else can I say? Oh! Sizing: I have an annoying pair of feet. Narrow, bony, almost always cold...not to mention the killer bunion on my right foot (which, mind you, never hurts when I'm wearing these boots!!! '). I'm somewhere between a size 8 and an 8.5 in most shoes. So I usually purchase an 8.5 to be on the safe side.
The first pair of Manitobah Mukluks I purchased with the Vibram soles was a size 7 since everyone kept emphasizing that these run large and should be ordered down a full size. Even the MM website says that.
Upon arrival, my big toe was so close at the front of each shoe that it was visible to others that they were pushing at the toe of the boots.
However, I kept them because at the time I ordered, there were no size 8s available and I didn't want to wait for them to come back in stock (who knows when that would have been, if ever). Plus, I didn't want to risk them being way more expensive than what I'd paid for the 7s.
Over time, the leather did stretch and the boots fit like a glove now.
That said, the next 2 pairs of MM I ordered are 8s. And those seem to simply have...""softened up"" over time, as opposed to stretching to accommodate my foot. I, personally, wouldn't order these in a 7 again. So, my suggestion: if you're juuuuust over a size or at a half size; don't go a full shoe size down when buying these.

That's all I can think to say about these at the moment. But I'll definitely update if anything else comes to mind. Oh, no; I know. One more thing.
If you're on the fence about purchasing these or debating paying so much for a pair of boots: GO FOR IT!!! They're so worth it. You won't be disappointed."
These socks are well made and of great material. Im 5'4 and the fit to my mid knee.
Love this organizer! I think it's very good quality for the money.
Love them- so soft and warm.  I did have to tighten the strings so they wouldn't slip off the heal.
Nice Navy top.  Very lightweight lighter color may be a bit see thru.  Comfortable.
I love these slacks.  They are very good quality.  They wear well and last a long time while looking good
Great fit and warm!!
"I got this for him for christmas from ""santa"" and he plays with it every day. He talks about how santa makes the greatest toys and that I should talk to him and find out how to get more toys like this from santa lol"
My husband finally switched from his tightly whities to these and will never go back. He says they are the most comfortable underwear he has ever worn. They don't ride up and he loves them.  I love that they are cotton. They fit true to size and wash well.
Great bra and nice details.
"I wear these shoes every day in the hospital, without an insert, and I never have an issue with my feet. They look great, they don't squeak on the floors, and the Adidas bottoms really are comfortable. I will buy another pair when I wear these out."
"These pants are very cute.  They are a little too small for me but then, I'm an adult who is small enough to fit in XL girls sizes much of the time, so I tried them.  They do fit, and are fairly comfortable.... but I would suggest ordering the largest size you can, so that they will stretch less when wearing...because when these pants stretch, some of the color is lost a little in the flowers and the background.  When the material stretches, you can see a whiter part of the material in the weave of the fabric a little more... It is not very noticeable... but essentially the colors will dull some the more these pants stretch... so for more vibrant pants... I would suggest ordering up in size.  Then the pants will last longer also for growing children, who for sure will not be happy about growing out of these pants!"
"These shoes are a bit roomier in the toe box than expected but the rest of the shoe fits well enough that they don't move around or cause weirdness in the snug areas. I could probably fit comfortably in a half size down. I got these for walking my dog, I usually walk but sometimes run so I haven't been too hard on them yet. They are nice and bright and people keep asking me if I got new shoes but I have had them for several months. I don't go around hopping in mud pits or anything but they seem really easy to keep clean and nice looking. Just don't step in dog doo, they have lots of nooks & crannies on the soles and you'll be cleaning for a while. They have lots of nubbies so good traction, if you wear them in shallow snow/ice conditions with yak traks you will be unstoppable!"
Nice color and nice fit. Nothing more to say.
Very comfortable dress. Perfect for the summer and vacations.
"Lovely robe - maybe a bit large - I am 5'6"" - 110 lbs - ordered the medium and sent it back for a small - still a bit large, but robes should be loose."
"Love the fit of this dress!! This is a Large. I'm 39"" in the chest & 5'3""."
"it's ok, the only complaint I have it that the ring is a little too big and little too flimsy. but it's a cute ring."
I work on an air ramp. rain or shine. -_-  this poncho is great. I can slip it on and put my reflective vest over it easily. I can carry it with me since it folds up nice and small.
"Hard to replace my old one but it was ruined by moisture.  I travel a lot and need something safe to carry my jewelry in.  This was perfect, as well as pretty.  It is soft with all the necessary pockets and in my opinion, far superior to a leather traveling case."
My grand daughter loves this suit. It fits very well.
"A good name brand shoe online is apparently something people do all the time. we had to take the plunge and I think it was worth it. they fit well, have lasted so far, and look good."
"Love these! They are very light and the coloring is great. Great price. I have several pair of Michael Kors sunglasses that I have paid a great deal more for and the qualtiy of these is the same.
 I would highly recommend these to anyone."
All good fits good
"Super comfy. I've been getting fussy about my shoes; with some giving me back pain but nothing after wearing these! I have them in
black and silver/white. Pretty much go with everything from jeans, yoga pants and capris..."
"The shirt is described as large, but it is a tad bit small on my son. The sleeves are too short. My son will wear it around the house and to play in so I will not be returning the item."
Absolutely adorable! And the price for so many onesies is awesome! Can't wait for it to be warmer so my little guy can wear these!
"Fancy affordable shoe! You can wear it with social or casual clothes!
Really comfortable and good grid!"
"Bought this for my 5'5"" mother in law. She loves it and she is hard to please"
"Love them, good fit, try to size. I'm a size 8 with voluptuous thighs, hips and butt, and these fit with a bit of extra room. A medium might have worked just as well, but I like this fit."
"These are a great value and long lasting. I've purchased several pair over the years. It doesn't hurt to have a little give on the waistline either, especially this time of year."
So far it's great.
Bought for my dad and he loves them!! Great quality and fit great.
"These boots are great looking, fit well, and I bought them for a very good price, under $40.  Most excellent."
"I bought these along with a couple other pairs of Mary Janes, my 2yrs niece loves them."
"Really nice rash guard.  I ordered an XXL, and its a good fit - not skin tight, but a bit loose (I'm 5'8"" and about 220lbs).  I wanted some sun protection for a long horseback ride in the hot sun on the beach, and I was afraid it would be too hot, but I could feel the wind blowing through it and I didn't feel overheated.  The material is a nice thickness - not cheap feeling.  Its a good length too.  If pulled tight straight down, would reach to my hips.  Wearing it normally with a bit of a bunch to the material still left a nice length, with no gaping at the waistband if you bent over.  Can't beat the cute color inserts either.  :)"
A little tight at the heel but overall not bad.
fantastic gift for a little girl
"For the cool graduate in my life, some aviator shades!  These were perfect!"
Very well pleased with the slides
"Nice and soft, and soooo cute!"
I love my my body shaper fits great give my bust a great  lift  now I can wear my low back dresses
"I bought these for my friend who is 5'9"", with a body type similar to the girl in the picture. These pants fit her PERFECTLY. I could not believe how good they looked on her. 100 stars!!!!!"
I wear a size 10.5-11 normal tennis shoe and this shoe runs slightly bigger than the 11 size that I got.
Order two sizes up for a proper fit. The fabric has nice weight and stretch to it. Nice enough to wear under a jacket to work. I've ordered a few colors already.
LOVE this hat for my husband. He never wore hats before but wears this every day. Keeps its shape and he says its very comfortable. Fit perfectly.
"A gift for a friend, and he loves them!"
I love them. My wife has them both on her keys!
Love this out fit! it so stylish and easy going! Only thing to be aware of is that you have to undo the buttons to use the bathroom so if your child can't do buttons its going to be an all day thing! Other then that super cute!!
Fit AMAZING! Right amount of support when going to the gym or not going to the gym.
Well made and color was exactly as it appears! I bought 2 different colors and will probably buy another at a later date! So soft to the touch! Love it!
not cold enough yet
"I measured my daughter and ordered according to her measurements. These pants required belt because they're too big. Wish I had returned them however she wore them and they got dirty, there for I have to keep them. They are nice looking and great quality that's why I steel braided it four stars. Sizing chart needs to be corrected."
These are by far the most comfy shoes I've ever had. Definitely buying several more pairs
Love the way they look.  And the fit seems great.  Have not had a chance to wear them for any length of time yet.
"As recommended by my orthopedic surgeon, I only wear New Balance.  I have been wearing them for about 10 years now & never have a problem walking all day wearing them.  These are just a fun color for an important cause.  I love wearing them.  New Balance is just the best show for me."
True to size. Very comfortable.
I like this nightgown very much.  Occasionally I use it for a slip under dark dresses that are see through.
Excellent product for the price - at least from a couple of weeks of use.
"Bought for my daughter and didn't expect much based on price, but they are well made and comfortable."
"nice, soft fabric and good fit. while the bra cup easily unclips for breastfeeding, it is nearly impossible to reattach one handed because of the bulk of the strap behind the clasp. perhaps it will get easier as it softens with wear? still a useful piece of clothing."
I chose a five star rating because the quality of this Nautica belt was exactly what I expected--solid. My five year old was excited for his first 'real' belt.
Always a good thing when you get 25 tongue rings for a great price!  Shipping was fast.
"It's perfectly good for casual purposes. I have a pair of regular glasses as well as a pair of sunglasses, and I'm able to fit both of them in this case easily. I just use the microbags that came with the glasses as padding between them so the lenses don't get scratched. I don't believe this case is sturdy enough for really rugged use. It's not a solid, hard case, and any really hefty weight placed on it would crush the glasses inside. If you're looking for a piece of indestructible armor for your glasses, this is not it. If you just want something to put one or two pairs of glasses in to keep them from getting scratched and provide casual shock protection, this is a good case."
This shirt fitted me very nicely. I enjoyed wearing the shirt.
"Socks! Who doesn't love a man in a good pair of socks? These are a great quality sock for a reasonable price. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a ""fun"" quality sock."
"Soft Style Alesia gets 4 stars even though I'm returning it, because the style is so cute- pointed but not-too-pointy, with a kitten heel, this is a classic, vintage looking shoe. The construction is decent, especially for the price. The size (I'm a WW, difficult to fit) was exactly right, and though there was something strange about the toe bed shape for my particular foot, these would be pretty comfortable. But the ""nude cloud patent"" color is hideous. It looks so much more pearl in the photos, in person it is super shiny peach. Perhaps for a person with a light peaches-and-cream skin tone this would work, but not for my olive tone. These are going back, but I would order this brand again, and specifically consider this very shoe in a different color."
"The sample that I received for review is very cute. It is made of sterling silver, with pearl. It was smaller than I thought it would be. It's the size of a nickel. Comes with chain."
"This dress is so cute! I got the M, going by the size guide. It's a tiny bit too small, but the fabric is stretchy so it's ok. I would recommend going up one size just to be sure the dress will fit you. It is a little longer than in the picture. It comes to about 2 inches above my knees, which is fine with me.  Overall I'm really happy with this dress. It's totally worth the money! If you want a cute, fun dress to wear when you're feeling witchy, you won't be disappointed! I will definitely be ordering more."
"Nice, light, very smooth material. Waiste doesn't curl up. Bought XL for my 38"" waist"
Comes  un buckled all the time already lost a piece of it
Perfect wig for a photo booth for kids and adults
"Got this for my daughter for school (10th grade) and she absolutely loved the style of it. However, she found that it had a smell that she referred to as a burning smell. Dad and I just found a leather smell but we're putting it in the machine on no spin and delicate to see if we can lessen the smell. If it doesn't work I'll use the backpack myself because I find it to be a perfect fine and nicely crafted backpack."
"When I saw this stunning ring it was a Must Have moment. It completely had my moms name written all over it. Which was exciting for me cause she has everything, but she didn't have this. Thrilled with my purchase price a value savings. My excitment got the best of me, she now has her Mothers Day gift 3m early. She loves it just as much as I do."
excellent^^
good ol hybrid shorts
this was bought for my grandson who lives in the cold north-he loves it and is being put into use almost daily with the cold weather where he lives.
I have been wearing MBTs for several years now and love them!  I have rheumatoid arthritis in my feet and they are the only shoe I can wear for most of the day without my feet hurting. I was pleased with the new style of this MBT because it is very attractive. These shoes have rocker bottoms and take some getting use to but once you do they are fantastic!!
"Exactly the one I need for several approaching international trips. Very light weight and comfortable to wear. My passport(in a cover) just fits with lots of room for cash, cards and other necessities you want to take on a jaunt around a strange city. I am traveling to Europe where pick pockets are rampant and so clever that they can steal from your bag - or cut the strap so quickly you will not realize it until it's too late..  If this belt is worn under clothing no one will ever know you have it on much less be able to steal from it without your knowledge"
These were and are one of my favorite onsies! I got some from my aunt at my baby shower and she sowed tutus on them! I had to get more! I love how they aren't to thick but they aren't thin and cheaply made!
"They are simple square earrings. They are larger than I thought they would be. They can be dressed up and classy, or everyday earrings. Comes in a black box with blue insides."
"Great quality product for such an affordable price. Super sexy. I'm 5'3, 185. I wear a size 14 and my breast size is a 38DD. This fit me perfectly."
Super cute and the skirt was surprisingly soft.
I had to exchange for a smaller size but the quality and comfort are definantely worth 5 stars. They are a fashionable comfort shoe.
"Bought these for my daughter.  Very beautiful, awesome."
My son was super cute what a great costume
Love these! Keep everything organized
I like this ring. Good fit with nice roudIt has good color to the stone and nice rounded edges. Nice shine to the metal at first. Over a few days there is a lot of scratches in the metal.
Keep me warm when I'm skiing and they handle the moisture better than the old-school cotton ones.  I'll probably end up buying a second pair to replace my old cotton thermal underwear
My 6 yr old son loves them.
My grandbaby doesn't leave home without it!
My daughter love these! They are cuter in person than I thought from the picture.
classics that don't wear out that fast given the price
"This dress is super cute, but seems to run small. My daughter is 2,5 and I usually get her size 3 which most of the time fits well or even too big, this dress is pretty tight on her though. Great look, just runs small."
"I wasn't sure if I would like these earrings but they're much nicer than I thought.  Very fashionable and trendy.  I was just speaking with someone the other day who was wearing a pair when these arrived.  They're not overly large but just right.  I especially like the extra detail of the decorative rib on either side of the ball.  The ball is free to spin and catches the light in a pleasant way.  Overall, a great product at a good price."
"I love this Switzerland/Bohemian Attractive Summer Soft Scarf! I received the blue colored scarf. Upon arrival, it has this excess thread that came off so I just cut that off. The material quality is good. I like it that it's not thick. It has a soft and smooth texture as well. The length is long enough to tie it in different styles how to wear it. This has become one of my favorite scarfs to wear!
***I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review."
"I ordered a size up because I like my shirts to be loose and flowy. This was made out of nice and light fabric, vneck was cute and it wasn't see through.

The picture is misleading because it makes it seem like this shirt is long when it's not. It's almost square. The shirt was ordered a size up for me and it barely touched the top of my bum. I'd like to order another one a size large but then the vneck would be ridiculously low. If you are not looking for a long tshirt though, then this is a good buy."
I love this shoe the fit is great
"That is some serious pink.  The picture makes it look light a light nude, but it's PINK."
"I loved how soft and comfortable these pants are that this is second pair I buy!  Nice enough to wear to office. Wash great. These have become my new favorites.
I hope Stylzoo offers pants made of this same material but not as wide pant legs and more colors SOON."
Nice and very well made jeans.
"I'm so happy with this. The color is beautiful and the material is soft and cool to the touch; it feels great when running outside in October. Very breathable and light, exactly what I hoped."
"I didn't realize I wore size small, it fits as expected! I will purchase more in the future "
"Shirt arrived quickly. Fits good, nice shirt for the price."
"These leggings are so awesome! They fit great, I cant wait to wear them to dance class lol should be fun. They look so cool"
"I absolutely love this little purse!  I wanted something small and protected for my upcoming trip to NYC, yet I wanted to make sure I was able to carry all of the essentials.  This purse is a perfect size and has so much room!  I had trouble trying to visualize the size of it when I was debating whether to buy it, so I took a picture of of it next to a regular 16.9 oz water bottle for size reference.  The water bottle will fit in the largest part of the purse and you can still zip it, but the water bottle would need to be at an angle, and I'm not sure there would be room for anything else in that compartment.

I love that there are so many zippered pockets on the outside to make for easy access for me. The pocket on the back side of it fits my galaxy s4 in its otter box defender case perfectly, and it is not tight where I will have trouble getting the phone in and out, yet is secure and not out in the open.  I was nervous, as I saw some reviews mentioning receiving a product with a strong chemical smell.  Mine is perfect and smells like leather, but not overpoweringly so.  The seller that I went through was Vine Branch. Prompt shipping and prime eligible.  The color is gorgeous (I got the burgundy), and the strap is adjustable but can be set to be pretty long if you want it for a cross body, or shorter for an over the shoulder purse.  I wanted it to sit just at hip level when wearing it cross body, and it is long enough that it could be even lower than that.  The strap is thin and not obtrusive, yet sturdy.  The only negative thing, which is not a big deal to me at all, is that the material on the inside seems cheap and thin.  I'm not going to try to tear it to test it, lol, but it seems like it could tear if you had something sharp in there.  Just a guess though, I could certainly be wrong, and it's not something that you see anyway.  Overall I am extremely pleased with this product.  I don't even want to say that it is such a great item for the price, because I would compare it to much more expensive items and still say it is a great product!"
"I like it a lot. I've had it for over a month and worn it a couple of times and the gold plated areas are changing colors, more brass looking now. I still rock it and like it."
Its a great boot but I found a really good comparable item for much much cheaper so it was returned.
Our daughter wore for a school project and she loved it.
great. Would buy again.
"I purchased this Incantasia the Glamour Witch costume for my 6.5 year-old and she loves it! I was looking for a good quality witch's dress because I wasn't impressed by the witch's costumes sold at some of the local retailers (the material was too flimsy, barely held up, and looked really cheap).

In contrast, this Incantasia costume not only looks beautiful but feels luxurious too. The material is soft and the purple inner lining is a great touch, not only aesthetically but also to provide some form of insulation. After all, by the time Halloween comes around, the weather might get a tad cold. The dress also has an attached belt which can be adjusted with a beautiful jewel brooch in the middle. The witch's hat also feels sturdier than most of the witch's hats I've seen at local retailers. It fit my daughter's head perfectly and is made in such a way as to be able to accommodate larger heads (since it states the size is for 6-8).

My daughter is about 50 lbs, and is about 46 inches tall and this dress fit her quite well, except for the collar which was a bit loose and there was a little room in the waist too. This is one of the most beautiful, well-made Halloween costumes we've purchased, and I'll definitely be checking out the manufacturer's other costumes for next Halloween!"
the shoes are just fine
"One of my favorites, but, the point is sharp!  Other than that, the piece is beautiful and meaningful.  I bought one for myself, as well as one as a gift."
"Warm, comfortable, great color. Fits but would have liked it just a little bit bigger. Might not order again, unless it goes on sale."
i bought this because we would have all day trips with a lot of walking and my normal purse starts to get really heavy after a while. this helped me downsize to just the essentials and the color is great!
"Fits ok, but make sure that if you were a half size. Ensure that you order a wide ""D or E"" width"
Beautifully made and so comfortable to wear.  Gives great support for yoga classes and low impact exercise.  Great to wear around the house for lounging.
"I really wish you could purchase the bottoms and top separate. The bottoms are a little big, but maybe I'll just grow a booty. Otherwise this is the second high-waisted bikini I've bought and they just fit so well on all sizes. Love!!"
"Really awesome product. Although we've only used it once so far, it was a breeze adjusting and putting on my son. Some Pro's and Con's..

Pros:
- Very professional and attractive packaging.
-Liked the idea of a product that could be registered for warranty
-adorable design/pattern
-Nice material
-Company seems to take much pride in their product
-The ""for best results"" and ""for worst results"" instructions on the tag for washing was a cute and humorous addition

Cons:
- I didn't like that the rivets on the inside were all the way through both layers of material. I feel as though that would get annoying or even painful on baby's skin. I read in a review somewhere that the newer version has the rivets through only the first layer of material so they don't rub on baby's skin, but that wasn't the case for the item I received, and I was under the impression that I was purchasing whatever model was up-to-date for this product.
- Says it fits 8-36 pounds, however my son is 3.5 months old, and although he's huge for his age, he's 17.5 pounds and on the last set of snaps for width adjustment, and the middle setting for rise adjustment. This is a disappointment, as it won't last longer than this summer."
"love it , nice and stylish"
My son loved this shirt! Wears it all the time
"have always wore these pants, great fit and long lasting, especially for the price"
A beautiful shoe.
A bit roomy and the material is stiffer than other similar gowns I have purchased
had one front pocket rather than two
"I think it will be several weeks before the boots are fully adapted to my feet.  I really like the boots and think they will be fine after they break in and are formed to my feet.  The straps and buckles of these boots require the leather to soften by constant flexing.  I previously wore Herman tanker boots.  These are better boots, but will require much more breaking in time."
"This is a great top, it fit perfect."
"I love this swimsuit, follow the size chart listed in the drop bar and you will get the perfect fit. The suit has some stretch to it and the fabric feels nice. I wear an 8 in tops and 10 in bottoms and decided on the XL (8/10). The bra does not have push up, but does have good support. Summer 2016 here I come."
Love the tall and snug neck. Very nice layering piece.

- Push button opens the wings.
- Easy to adjust and set.

- Overall, super unique... I've never seen anything like this.

Note: Doesn't come with a vase.

Note: I was given a sample of this product in exchange for a review and demonstration, which of course has no bearing on the honesty of my opinions regarding the product. Hope my demonstration and test helps!

 Bottom line: would I recommend this product to one of my friends?
 Yes, absolutely."
Runs a little large but my 6 year old still loves. Super soft. And the price was very good
Comfy. Wore it with the zipper in the back. Very sexy
"Very nicely made, wash well"
"A nice city-chukka boot with the usual good Timberland quality. The sole is a bit thinner than I'd like under the front 1/2 of the boot, and I wonder about the long-term wear, but the long lean look makes this stylish enough to mix with casual, nicer jeans and even office casual wear during mixed weather.  Stormproof welting, and oiled leather keeps this one watertight in the rain and snow, it also appears to be able to be easily resoled if it comes to that."
I love these watches
I love the rainbow-of-colors look and the fit is good. I bought my usual size 8.5 B width and there's plenty of rm in the toe box. At first wearing they were soo comfortable; but after 4 hrs of shopping my heels started to hurt.  I usually wear New Balance walking shoes which now have an orthodic insole but are not very attractive. I'm going to buy an orthodic insert for these and see if that helps. These come w/2 prs of shoelaces-hot pink and white and look great with blue jeans.
Love the variety of colors. Was delivered quick and also nice customer service they were so sweet !!! Thank you! Will order more.
This is Good!
"Love this shoe, bought another almost like this and is extremely comfortable."
The outfit fits perfect & the headbands are a perfect fit also.
"good quality, long lasting work pants."
"Hard to wear all day.  the unusual fabric is a bit rough on my soft skin ..  after a few washes with softener I hope they will be better.
Otherwise I think they're  Ok"
"No issues during this transaction, nice looking, good quality"
"I love this dress, fits nice and I have gotten a ton of compliments on it! The only con is to get this dress a size or 2 larger than your normal size it is cut small. I normally wear Large or X-Large, I purchased the XX-Large based on other reviews I read and I am glad I did:)"
Love these shoes!  Exactly as pictured!
"Although I am hesitant to purchase clothing over the net, this pant fits perfectly and is high quality. I am totally satisfied with all aspects of the purchase"
"Love them! They feel durable for lots of riding but look nice enough to wear on ""Jean"" Friday at work. I'm getting another pair:)"
The perfect Cat in the Hat costume.  It was not expensive and the quality of the costume was superb. The gloves gave it the perfect touch.  One advance the top hat must be stuffed with tissue paper to sit straight up.
"Nice, fine, great value."
I love these shoes...they are super comfortable but don't look dorky. These are my sons second pair and he loves them...I love that they aren't flip flops or crocs;)
Coolest rain boots ever!
"I really like these. They sit right on top of my glasses. You can only see my glasses if you're looking close enough. I do notice when looking at my phone a polarized glare, because they're polarized. So take note if you don't like that. Nice thick sides with a little pattern on them. Sturdy!"
"I love the fabric! Nice quality, not the light-cheaply made feel some shorts can have. Will definitely buy again."
Awesome but gosh the boot is soooooooowide and super tall around the leg for a 7 year old.
Nice basic.
This shirt is awesome! Looks exactly as pictured and love the fit and VNeck. Love the bright rainbow colors.
Super happy. It wears beautifully. Light material perfect under cardigans or suit jackets
It's better then expected. Great Value!
Very well made but the the area at the top of the ankle cut into the ankle making it rather uncomfortable.
"Approx 6 years ago I got one of these, my very first Birkenstock. They are just perfect. They last, they are beautiful and comfortable. Decided to retire old pair and this new one. It is exactly the same. Amazing consistency with a great product over the years."
"I like that the hem is a little different, but you have to wear the right pants with it."
"The bag seems solidly built. I carry college materials in it so nothing super heavy.
The things i don't like are its a little floppier than i was hoping for, so it won't sit up on its own in say a chair or at your feet.
The velcro on the lid came unstitched on one side,  after about a month so i had to make a repair.
Other than that its nice enough."
This is a great gym bag. Excellent quality & very durable at a very reasonable price. You will not be disappointed!
The color is way off of the actually leggings you receive. The actually color is cartoonish royal blue
"Perfect for traveling, holds everything I need, and is lightweight!"
"First thing, it does say that the waistband is an individual waistband, which means that the pattern is different than pictured. Actually, I like the waistband I received, it looks better than the one pictured. The pattern on the pants is as pictured and really they look great in person. I'm 5'3"" and the pants fit me perfectly, they are comfy and the waist band is stretchy so they will fit a lot of different sizes. The pocket does have the zipper closing and I think that is what sets these pants apart from others.  One thing they are scratchy out of the package but they do soften up after washing and there is no problem. Overall I'm very pleased with these pants and I hope they come out with more styles."
great hat for very cold weather
Favorite bra.  Very supportive and it really does improve the appearance of back fat.  Supports the girls nicely.
Fit and wear just like the GoWalk 2's but with canvas uppers as opposed to the nylon mesh. Extremely light and comfortable.
These shoes stay on the 18-month old better than any other sandal we have tried. See Kai Run makes excellent products.
My 20 month old likes these shoes.  They don't seem to cause him to trip and fall as other bulky shoes do. They are easy to take on and off and they can get wet.  They fit his fat feet.  The only problem I have noticed is they do have the smelly feet smell after my son wears them as there is really nothing to absorb the sweat but that is expected.
"I'm very happy, if it did shrink it was next to nothing. Most shirts I get the arms seem to shink and I end up with just another rag."
my new fav winter boot
"He loved it, but used it all the time and now its time to buy another one. Wish it would last more than a year. He is very careful with things he purchases."
could be a little larger
wonderful colors and quality.  Thank you.
"I had extremely high hopes for the shoes based on reviews.  They are comfortable to wear, the elastic around the shoe does not cut into my heal like some similar flats I have had in the past. There was no breaking in required. I would have given them 5 stars except that is little padding which makes walking in them all day not ideal. I still like them and would recommend, just be aware they may not work if you are on your feet all day."
"Just a heads up, I ordered size 12m but the tag on the onesie says 6-12m. Luckily it still fits!! Otherwise very cute onesie perfect for Halloween."
Gift for daughter; she loved it.
Seems to be heavy and sturdy.  Will be ordering other dinosaurs.  Cute and unexpected.
"Fit as expected, good price too."
"I love this luggage!! It's not only lightweight, easy to wheel and stylish, but it's very roomy. I take a lot of trips and was looking for a set that will hold up as my last set literally fell apart. I was very excited when I found this set. It took about 20 mins to remove
the plastic over each suitcase(you can't see it, but read the instructions) and the finish went from a matte to shiny. I'm taking this to Vegas next month and can literally fit everything without a problem. I also like the inside zipper part because it has compartments which my last set didn't have. Highly recommend!!"
Always wonderful
Nice for the coast!
"Recently I was wandering around my favorite Montenegran casino and I bumped into noted author/auteur Biff Rafferty, just returning from the Scandinavian art lecture circuit. He gave my evening attire the quick once over and announced I was too bland. Too Continental. What I needed was the flash and glow of blue paisley! Once again, Biff was right. The color also tends to highlight my blue eyes and straight cut bangs."
"Perfect fit, smooth as described."
"Super comfy, no problem with the fit for my 17.5 inch circumference calves. I'm 5'3"" and these go up to the knee. I plan to get more in fun patterns."
"These belts lay totally flat and absolutely, comfortably, keep your pants up! Even low-cut jeans stay in place much better. Now I don't have to keep tugging them up when no one is looking :-)"
its my something blue.
I love this one it is very comfortable.
a little shear but I love it
Gorgeous top! I love the fit and flow and sparkle this top offers up. Perfect for the office in summer because it's always freezing cold in there. Thin enough to keep you cool while keeping your arms warm.
"Really cute, I use it as my pinkie ring."
"I'm not skinny and these won't just make me thin,but it's a nice level of compression. It is not uncomfortable in any way, but I can always feel it, so it's great for correcting a lazy slouched stance/gate. Don't get me wrong, it's not uncomfortable when I do ""relax"" a little, but it obviously gets way tighter which reminds me. I wear X/XXL depending on style and cut of shirt. Most T's are fine in an X, nicer stuff usually XX. Bought the XL size. Haven't had to wear a suit in over a year so I don't have my actual chest measurements on hand. I know that would help more sorry. 40 waist. Probably around 46in chest."
"Awesome and went well with the others I have...which, by the way, is the second one I have BOUGHT...I now have several and could have SAVED $ by buying through AMAZON...hoping for more too come..."
It's a great shirt. Not thin and almost transparent like some white shirts. Easy to iron and fits great.
"Just received them. Fit is OK. I would like the sleeves a little longer, but the length is good. You get a heat transfer logo on the Left sleeve. Obviously would prefer the embroidered one but at this price, that it what you get. The length is a bit long, but for casual wear like I will use them it's fine. Material is medium weight and I'll have to see how they hold up after a few washes. Overall I'm happy with them so far."
"The top leather panel of these sandals is often regarded as uncomfortable and digging into skin. That is correct but also easily corrected with water: full grain leather (every kind of leather, actually) softens when wet. It then tends to give and yield a bit, usually enough for a nice smooth fit. If not, the size is too Narrow and should be returned for an M size of same number."
Great feel and great fit - love everything about them and will be buying more
These shoes are beautiful and I love the little gold emblem on the back. They are comfortable and I've worn them all day several times. They are a basic black pump but the little details make them special
Very classy maxi dress!
"Bought these in Dark Brown for my husband. The minute he put them on, he loved them. True to size and they look great. Perfect for casual dress up and even with jeans. I just love penny loafers and I'm stoked my husband does, too!!! At the deal we got them, these are wonderful. Frye's rock!"
"I like these sunglasses a lot. They work well with my round/square face (depending on who you ask). They are comfortable. They come with a cloth microfiber bag/ drawstring case that works well for cleaning, but doesn't offer any protection. They fold relatively (but not totally) flat. They seem good quality, though not totally scratch/impact resistant, as I have already managed to get a couple dings in the lenses after just a month, but nothing too bad."
The handbag inside is great with the compartments and it is so stylish.
My 16 year old Loves it!!
"The snake head was a little cheesy, but overall, it's nice."
My husband looks good in these they fit nice ty
"I'm a safe 9.  I can even wear 8 1/2 in most shoes.  So when I say it's too small, it really is.  Because I don't wear it often, I decided to keep it, but I wish now I'd exchanged it for a larger size.  I would love it if it fit correctly.  So, four stars."
Very comfortable shoe. True to size. Nice change from wearing a high heel shoe.
"These are truly amazing jeans!  The fit is awesome and the length is perfect.  The are a bit tight right now, because I sized down based on my other 7 jeans so they SHOULD loosen up juusst a tad.  I didn't want them to get the 28 and they get too loose..I made that mistake before.  The color is great! Love them!! Worth the price!"
"Colors were ok but definitely more guy oriented than for a girl.  Look brighter in the pics on Amazon than what they actually were.  It's all good, product was as expected."
Very good quality! I bought for my son as a gift and he loves it...
Fits perfect. I bought 2 I love it!!!
This was a real hit. Fit my husband perfectly and the chest part is really quite impressive! LOL. He looked great and got tons of compliments! Very good price for such a nice costume!
I love this chain! I've bought several from this company before. The mirror box is great for pendants. I abuse them. I sleep with them. I shower with them. And they stay as beautiful as if they were new. I highly recommend them.
Very beautiful and comfy sole (padded?)
"Cons: sole is slippery and, as others have said, it is made of fabric like material not rubber. It wears off in threads. Weird. Probably less expensive to make. They are pretty costly.

Pros: really comfortable - spreads my abused 49 year old toes apart in ways that feel like something I have always needed. Not used for painting my toenails as I don't want to get polish on them. It's completely therapeutic. Even though they cost a lot I figure my feet are worth it. Will buy another pair for sure. Love the leopard design.

On fit: I wear a size 8.5 tennis shoe and found the 7-8 size fit perfectly on my feet. I like my sandals to fit my feet exactly the size they are. I trip if they are longer. Width perfect and decent arch support. Toe spreaders are a comfortable padded cloth."
Nicely tailored.
Amazingly comfortable!
Beautiful watch - heavy and nice large face - great value!!
"Wonderful shoe, and coincidently vegan. I've been trail running with these for a few months and only have good things to say. I'll be buying another pair when these wear out."
"Was not expecting ouch for the price, once I got it I was very surprised by how awesome it was. I would suggest if anyone is looking at one."
"The dress is amazing, it's simple yet classic. I am very impressed. Upon opening the package, I thought it might be too big for me however when I try it on it's perfect.

I am petite, about 4'11, I ordered size small and it's exactly what I needed. The material of the dress is very soft and comfortable, as a matter of fact it is stretchy and pure cotton..I am pretty sure it is durable. I wash it cold and tumbled dry.

There are several colors to choose and I got mine in color Jade. It is remarkable because I have stilleto in color Jade too and when I wore it to work everybody was so impressed how I carry my nice dress. My husband even said wear that to our date night..

I got this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. I am definitely satisfied with what I got. The delivery was great, the quality is perfect.

This dress is good for all occasion, wear it to work, church, party, home, shopping. It is suitable for spring,summer and fall season. I love it and it is one of my favorite dress to wear now."
Bought these for my husband and he loves them!  He has VERY large hands and the gloves fit him perfectly.  Seem to be high quality.
Great shoe. Looks even better in person. Very comfortable.
"GREAT! Super quality socks in neon colors. Cant get them, so good looking they stop traffic love them, other colors please!"
really very light and easy on a solid ground to maneuver  love the different color so can find my suitcase pretty fast.
I have two other pairs in a different style so I knew to buy a half size smaller than usual. I usually wear a 7.5..bought a 7 and was surprised to find they were still too long..kept slipping off my heel. I intended to return them but I purchased them on the last day of a 20% off sale and was going to lose my 20% off ..so I purchased a pkg of 2pr of heel protectors for less than $3..put 1 pair in my new shoes and they fit perfectly..these are my favorite shoes right now
"I can wear them conformably for hours.  I have flat feet, so I don't fault the shoes.  Nice look."
"I got this outfit and the matching blanket as a gift for a friend, The set seems to be of good quality and is very cute. My friend loved it!"
I love these pants and went on order record to buy some more but it comes up unavailable!  Please make more!!!!
"They are ok. Not the most supportive or comfortable slippers i have owned, but as novelty slippers they were nice. They don't last a long time before the padding goes flat."
These are fun shoes and look good.  very comfortable
Ready for business.
"The Nautical swim suit is very light weight, comfortable and colorful.
I am very satisfied with this purchase."
My girlfriend wears them all the time.. Its time to get her a white pair now
"4 stars for now since I just got it and walked around the block. The heel is the bulk of the feel right off the bat.  The measurement feels true.  Gonna break it in some more and I'll update it. Awesome so far.

UPDATE Dec 20, 2015
I had to update this review.  in regards to the lacing system, mine came with regular laces and not the quick lace system everyone is whining about.  I would've replaced the laces with regular laces anyway.  I've had these boots for a couple of months now and I must say, these are fantastic.  I've taken them on weekend hikes and most recently, to El Yunque rainforest in Puerto Rico where they performed flawlessly.  They were comfortable all around, great ankle support, waterproof as heck, and took everything the forest threw at it.  They have very good grip but there were some cases in the forest where these didn't help with traction(to be fair nothing would've lol).  But that wasn't a deal breaker at all.  i was dreading the 2 hour hike back downhill but the heel part of the boots finally made sense.  It gave you better control and support and put less stress on your knees which was great.  Highly recommend these and after i go through them i will most certainly without a doubt get another pair.  And so now we face the winter and will update on my winter hikes with these.  Cheers!"
Beautiful poncho..lots of compliments!
"I had to wear a tank under the top as the V neck is pretty open/low, but otherwise, this is a great shirt!"
My son loves this belt and gets compliments all the time
"Exactly the same picture , I love it"
"I love this skirt much more than I thought I would. It came a little differently than I expected, but I guess that I didn't look at the picture close enough. The top of the skirt is a bit fitted. In other words, the pleats don't start a the waist. I may not be explaining it well, but either way, I ended up loving the skirt. The material was great, thick, and high quality. The skirt overall was very voluminous and beautiful. The colors were rich and this may now be my new favorite skirt!"
First and foremost this is a juniors size jacket. Juniors comes after children sizes and then there are woman's sizes. So I bought this for my 10 year old daughter that wears true to her size of 10/12 in large children shirts. I bought a small because everyone said it runs small. Well it fits like a size 14 in girls. Which is what a small in juniors is. So the sizing is actually accurate. The tag even says a s 14. She loves it. It is rather thin but we live in California so hopefully it won't be a problem.
Just right thickness warmth for cold but not frigid weather.
"It is rather wide, but it is the most comfortable ring I have ever worn.  It will show scratch marks.  Very pleased with the price and quality of this ring."
"I bought the infant size for my 1 year old.  While it's still a little big, the quality of the hat is very high.  Because of the sizing issues, I would only give it 4 stars."
"Nice quality, and big enough for travel!"
Nice suit for the price!
Great!  Was just as stated.
"These are great shoes. Cute pattern on the leather. The strap is neither to tight or to loose. They are very light weight, making them easy to wear all day."
I bought these from a local store on an impulse and tried them on at home with numerous outfits and fell in love!  Because I had an amazon gift card I returned them to the store and ordered them from amazon.  They fit true to size for me.  I love that they go with so many different outfits!
Bought this before I got pregnant and loved it. I've been using it pregnant too. Great product!
Used for a costume.  Comfortable.
I can't say I love these sneakers but they do the job.  They fit a bit more snug then other Nike I have purchased and they are cute.
"Wonderful shoe, great delivery time frame."
Bought this set for my nephew. When he opened them he hugged them to himself. He was so pleased with them.
Very nice fit and feel.  Recommend highly.
"Runs true to size. Shallow pockets. Very comfortable. The price-to-quality ratio is pretty good.

We'll see how they hold up after a wash!"
"Great hoodie, nice seller!!!"
"Looks to be classic Kamik quality boots, but the boot and liner are tight on this one.  Usually have room for winter socks in my Kamik size 11 boots, but this will likely only be comfortable with a thin layer of socks.  Will keep them, as they may be more useful as summer boots now."
had a funny smell but that left after a few hrs. thick soled and sturdy. waterproof.
Well made and came as described. My wife liked her earrings. Of you are looking for an inexpensive solution for giving some earrings as a present this will fit the bill.
He was absolutely handsome in this outfit!
Dont like the pads but overall its a really nice swimsuit
high quality.  very soft fit perfectly
"The dress is very pretty and the colors are just as pictured, bold and bright.  I have a little room in the dress which brings out my shape and makes me look great!  The dress is very comfortable and cool and soft and the material is strong and made well, not see through.  I know I will have this dress for a long time.  I have ordered other dresses from MSK and I am never disappointed.  This dress fits me just right and I am 5'2 and weighs 145 lbs, in a size small.  This dress will be worn to work and church and I already have a pretty shrug to wear with it just in case I get cold.  These are the deals I like when I order a dress from Amazon good material, good dress, good taste and good prices!!!"
This costume was super cute! My son loved it. Good price and great quality!
"This was a Christmas gift for a family member and they're in love with it! It's extremely soft and warm and the color is even better than in the picture online. The price is even better! All I have to say, is I wish I bought myself one!"
The pink is very pretty.  The earrings are light and very well made.  Just gorgeous. Going back for more colors.
"The picture shows a legging, this is not a legging, but regular capris pants. They were huge on me, but Amazon has amazing return policy."
"The product is unique. Its smell and texture make it pleasant to use. I apply it with just my finger. It does wonderful things for my cowhide wallet. It softens the leather and after a few applications, it produces a deep gloss finish."
"love this brand..they are similar to dickies gen flex,they fit well and feel great,they have a flattering fit to any body shape.."
"I imagine this needs to be pretty much perfect for you- since it isn't all that adjustable, but for me this is a great bra.  I don't get those nasty bulges, because it fits very smoothly, and it's quite comfortable.  What isn't all that great is that it is not padded- you can't really use this with t-shirts, unless you don't mind nipple show through."
Much more comfortable and durable. Highly recommend.
SO DANG CUTE!
I recommend you purchase one size larger. Beautiful dress
Fun item.. one size fits all is good for me and my daughter.
"Beautiful watch. Substantial and striking. Haven't had it long enough to speak for performance, but I look forward to a long time of wearing it."
"Bought for my son and although a tad large for the size, he loves the shirt-breathes very well and comfortable to wear."
"I love this bra. Fits great. It keeps its shape and doesn't do the uniboob style. The straps and back are wide enough for good support for larger cup sizes. I also like the multi-colors. It's a good bra for everyday or exercise. It won't completely keep you from bouncing when running or high impact, but it's still a decent bra for the gym. It lifts really well and can make your chest look larger - so be aware if you are looking for a minimizer. It won't show cleavage even with larger cups. I really like the shape of this one. I plan to buy more in other colors."
I put them on on the first day as soon as they arrived in the a.m. and did not take them off until I returned home late in the p.m.
Earns 4 stars because I hate wearing a bra but it is comfortable
"The Mens Brief Basic Print Underware Casual Cotton is perfect fit. Colors are bright and wash well. The stitching is perfect, does not ride up when wearing. Love this product. Product was received for a discount for my honest review."
What a nice flattering option to shorts! Quality and fit is good. Size is as it says which is a huge plus these days! Material is durable. Have not washed yet but it's not flimsy in construction that I can see. I bought them for golf originally but I've already ordered more as it's my new throw on gear for summer. Great price too! Thanks for making them true to size!!
PERFECT PAIR OF SHOES FOR EVERYDAY AND HELPS KEEP ME WALKING IN COMFORT. A GOOD NEUTRAL COLOR THAT MATCHES ALL MY EVERYDAY CLOTHES.
"I got sick of my leather wallet sticking to my phone, forcing me to remove both each time.  This wallet is well built, and very thin.  Unless you pack it full of business cards.  I try to avoid that, but if you have to take 30 around all the time, you can over pack this thing.

Overall, it is very comfortable and I'm very happy with it."
Adorable. My cousin loves starbucks and this is the closest charm I could find that resembles that. Charm is shiny. Its perfect.  Would recommend !
"Purchased for our daughter's Sesame Street themed birthday party...all family members wore character t shirts. Has held up well, but the graphic cracked after a couple washings. Not a big deal since they aren't worn anywhere but around the house."
"So comfortable, feels like your walking okn clouds.. absolutely love these shoes."
"Came exactly as pictured. It's 2017 and I still have them and they look the same, minus the backs I lost."
"More comfortable than expected ! Super light, yet durable."
"Great Bra. Also used a bigger one during pregnancy.
Best bra Ever!"
I use these all the time. They don't fall down and the color is perfect for use with my flats.
"Nice bright color, fits well, son loves it."
"I was looking for a bag that wasn't too heavy and this is perfect.  Roomy, lined and with a cute print"
"My wife loved them, she has small earlobes and they fit her well."
"I'll probably buy this brand again.  The fit was correct which is always the main concern when buying clothes on line.
These are as good as any I've seen in dept. stores and price was fair."
I've worn these a couple of times now and really liked the way they hugged my feet and stayed on all day. Very comfortable.
LOVEEEE THEM!!!
"Comfy, sturdy, just wish rubber sole was more giving/ shock absorbing"
"I'm 5'4"" and 125 lbs. This fits amazingly well. It's clingy but not too tight, if you know what I mean, and it doesn't ride up at all, which is great. My only sadness is that I snagged it a little on the first wearing. The fabric is not the very highest of quality; you can tell the stripes are just printed on top, but it'll do fine if you don't snag it. I might just order another one, I like it that much."
Fit well!
Love the elastic that molds to your instep and helps to keep it on your foot!  It is elegant looking and very comfortable.  I would order another pair if they still had my size.
"Great dress! Cute, comfy and fun!"
"Very nice over knee socks: not tight as others ( I bought several of other brands). Looks good with black boots, with short boots as well as with over the knee one. For that price, better experience than expectation!"
"Kat says these shoes are have the usual comfort, style & durability that Clark is known for; They will last a long time.  Because of the color, they have some limitations, but are great for that perfectly matched ensemble."
"Bought these for work, there Great!! they are long just past my knee's. But im 6'2 so it works well with me."
"LOVE these shoes. They are cute and comfortable with enough lift to be sexy. The color is awesome too. The insides are nicely cushioned also. A+++++ Would buy again. Will probably buy in another color, actually."
Shoe trees were a gift no feedback at this time.
Got this shoe.  Awesome color.  Could wear all day if I had to.  Eventually bought another pair.
Love the bag evrythibg is perfect but I wish it was a little smaller but that's not a bad thing just my opinion. Thank you for the fast shipment and the beautiful bag!
"Good product,fit perfectly"
Very pleasant accessory.
"It was a little big for me, but I like it."
"I adore this dress.  Perfect length, perfect fit, doesn't look baggy, sleeves are slightly long but that isn't an issue because I commonly roll sleeves because I like the look and bracelets show. I love the green and taupe colors. I used  spray wrinkle remover ( my favorite thing to ""iron"" with) and it worked beautifully to remove the packing wrinkles.
Now if you wonder about sizing, and I know sizes can run differently) I would order your usual size. I am 5'4"", 142 pounds, bra size 36D. I ordered a size 10 and this dress is an absolute perfect fit. I love the colors because they are perfect for year round....paired with a sandal for summer or boots for winter. It is a style that can be dressed up with heels or worn more casually.  The dress was already wonderfully priced, but with some points from my Amazon credit card I really  scored for three bucks. Just love it!"
This product really worked to remove toe marks on my Toms!
"These are so sexy, sleek,and comfortable. The material is lightweight so it's cool."
Wife loves these and the matching necklace.
Beautiful dress for my 5 year old! She was a hit at the princess party and she was not the celebrant!
Looked great but fit large and wide.  I returned the product.
"I just love this brand, they are great. The sandals are soft and comfy and perfect for just running errands around town. I love them."
"not too big...not too small...not too hot...just right.  I ordered all the colors for my hubby...his (casual dress) office is so cold in the winter, these look great and do the job."
"Substantial knit, about as heavy as the Dickies, but while the fabric of the Dickies is very close-knit and somewhat stiff, the Carhartt's are softer, more supple. They are also not cut as narrowly as the Dickies. The Carhartt's seem like a true L/T, while the Dickies are too narrow. Good colors and nice pocket."
Love these flip flops.  Very comfortable and easy to walk in at beach or the grocery.
These were a Christmas gift for my wife and she loves them.  I see her wearing them all the time.
"These little guys are essential for anybody that wears athletic shoes or boots for multiple hours of the day. I have gone through trying many powders and sprays to help with moisture in the feet and odors throughout the day. These guys are the absolute best!  Don't get me wrong, I still wash my sneakers in the washing machine frequently, will still put a little powder and a little spray if needed, but the addition of these balls in my sneakers every night has really helped. I also suggest putting these in gym bags."
"I bought this to wear in Vegas for halloween.  I love the way this costume looks, but there was a fixable fit issue.  The costume is cute, it fits well through the bodice and the skirt hits right below my butt so that my entire butt is covered (although I did buy a short petticoat to wear under the skirt for some extra fit and coverage).  I have a longer torso and had tried on some other Halloween costumes that didn't cover my butt at all.  This one at least covers it, but I certainly won't be bending over in this out in public.  The main fit issue that I had was that there was way too much material in the bust.  I am a 34 C and I felt like my boobs were lost in all the extra fabric.  For a quick fix day of Halloween I pulled down and tucked the extra white fabric into the top of the black bodice piece and pinned it into place.  I eventually would like to sew it in, but haven't gotten around to it yet.  My only other problem with the costume is that it arrived extremely wrinkled.  Both the cape and the skirt were extremely wrinkled and both say that they can't be ironed.  I tried ironing the costume through another piece of fabric and it just barely helped.  I wish there was another way to iron the costume.  Other than those two minor issues, I'm still pretty happy with the overall look of the costume."
Reordered item in correct size.
"I bought these shoes to wear around the pool. They run true to size, I suppose. I use a Dr Scholls insole and the shoes fit great & feel much better when I walk around in them."
I have been having a lot of trouble with my arch. I love walking but could not find a comfortable pair of shoes. These shoes give great arch support and I can wear them all day with no discomfort.
Very very comfortable. You can be in these shoes and on your feet all day and no discomfort. Great delivery time.
Perfect top for those of us with flabby arms and cant wear female tshirts without feeling self conscious. It fits like a tshirt but with longer arms to cover the flab. I love it. Nice soft material as well. I don't know if it will shrink when washing because I dry clean.
The case is beautiful and exactly as I expected.  I like it so much that I have already ordered another.
"Beauty comes at a price. This is the most beautiful and the frustrating watch ever! I had to rely on my jeweler to adjust the band length, which is very long, then be given a tutorial as to how I could master the clasp well enough to put on by myself. It is very tricky, not for the myopic and incredibly fiddley. So, will not be worn often which is a pity as it looks so good"
Very Nice Hat - I would like it if the vents were a little more air allowed through.  My Dad loves it!
great watch at a great price!
"Lovely denim overalls. Son wore it often, until it grew out of size. Comfortable, not hard. To him go any T-shirts and sweaters. I'm happy. Now it is the boy next door. Gave as good as new"
"These things are super warm.  I'm 5'4 and weigh about 120. It's hard to find pants that fit in the waist AND the rear.  I think these run a little bit small. I ended up needing to get the 30 to not have them super tight but could have gone with the 28 if I didn't mind them being SKINNY skinny jeans. AT 28, the waist fit great.  At 30, the rear fits better."
Great fit. Long tail.
"This necklace looks much nicer in person. It sparkles, and the details are small and delicate. In the photo, it looks large and bulky, but in person it is a fine detailed necklace that looks very pretty. The sterling silver links on the chain are small and shine next to the ultra shiny gemstones. The 18 inch chain size is a nice size, for a small neck, but the 20 inch would hang lower. This necklace arrived in a hinged box that slid out of another jewelry box. Overall, this necklace is very nice!"
"very breatheable, soft and comfortable"
"I ordered these shoes for my son and the size was perfect and the shipping was fast, only if my post office would have gotten it to me on time I had to go to my post office and pick them up because they had them there and wouldn't ship them out yet but other then that my son loves these shoes he says they are comfortable and he runs great in them there not to tight which is the problem we have had in the past I would recommend these to any soccer player."
"I normally wear a medium, but ordered a large because I like extra room for layering. This hoodie is light weight, perfect for layering or when you don't need a heavy sweatshirt."
"fits perfect, I love it!"
Great well balanced purse for an adult

Needed a dress for Friday Night Wedding, Ordered it in Wine and Navy.  Navy I chose, looked very nice and fit perfectly and I loved the look and it was extremely comfortable to have on which made all the difference in the world.  I felt good in this dress!!"
"my 5 year old loves this, fit him true to size!"
"the best running shoe i ever had.
when the shoe fits etc'"
I am satisfied with my purchased. Warm and cozy
Everyone is on here bitching about these boots. you get what you pay for. you cant expect to wear these all day and them not fall apart. I wear them with a certain outfit to church and to work. (I have an office job). use your brains and think before you order something. they fit me great and they were comfortable. I wear an 8 and that is what I got. Gots lots of compliments on them. would love to have them in white if I can find them on here.
Fits well except the torso portion was a bit short on one pair and long on a second pair.
This shoe is as it looks. It fits great for lazy wear. But if you sweat in your shoes or get them wet... they stretch out and do not shrink back.
keen is my only brand
"I Had To Shorten The Band,But Other Than That It's Very Nice."
I like it but it is awkwardly shaped and difficult to wear
"nice loafers. very comfortable. just wish they were real leather, but for the cost, you could buy a new pair every year."
Seems comfortable for everyday walking.  Will probably order more of these down the road.  The top strap takes a little time to get use too.
good quality and sooooooo cute
"Great product. Fit as expected for the most part. Neck opening is a bit large, but liveable."
"Watch itself is great
Bracelet is ok
Hard to beat value"
"Bought It to make a present but it was so nice, they got a gift certificate and I kept it myself. Nothing else needs to be said"
"Tahnyou again IZOD as usual I receive this purchase in very good conditions, I love the apeareance of the cloth and the soft in touch of the fabric"
These make organizing and packing luggage so much easier. Love how they keep everything in its place and separated. The expansion zipper allows several more items to fit in the bag. Bought the turquoise and the lime green and love them both.
"My baby daughter hates wearing tights, but during the cold months they provide extra warmth.  As a compromise I purchased these sock along with the Jefferies cable knee socks and some leg warmers.  She always chooses the knee high socks over the tights.  She stays warmer and I don't have to fight with her about wearing uncomfortable tights."
An time. Look great
"Really beautiful bracelet! Was pretty disappointed that it didn't come in a box though. Just a plastic bag. Really lack luster for such a pretty item. Giving as a gift so now I have to find a box for it. Other than that, I think my mom is really gonna love it!"
Great pair of Nike's.
Soft and warm.  Just what I needed...
Warm and stay on very well.
Love this light weight rain jacket
"I have a drawer of bra's and don't like any of them, regardless of their price. I couldn't stop looking until I found the perfect one, this is it!! I got the 34 C, the fit is perfect, the material is soft, the straps are comfortable which is always an issue. This bra is perfect if you are looking for something that gives the right amount of support and lift. Now need one in several of the colors offered. It's a good day!!"
Looks fantastic on my hubby. It's his new  favorite hat.
fit great and colors are holding well in the wash.
"I ordered white, large. I am 5'6"" 127 lbs. Perfect fit. As another reviewer suggested, I removed the elastic at the waist. For me, it was not needed and are even more comfortable without it. There is lots of drape and puddling at the ankles and the band's are not tight. After I see how or if they shrink when I wash them I will order more colors. Great buy!!"
"Fits suunto core perfectly, seems to be good quality. I found it difficult to install, it was a 2 person job!"
A bit see through but overall very cute.
So comfy. Reef is my fave slipper
"These arrived on time and in perfect condition. They fit a tiny bit big, but if I think if I would've sized down a 1/2 size they would be too big. I love the old style emblem and pattern on the toe. Great shoes and worth every penny!!"
Very cute and stylish! I love a little heel and these shoes are perfect and make my feet feel secure and stable when walking.
These shoes exceeded my expectations. I was glad for customer feedback because while these sneakers were super comfy the advice to loosen the top laces was a game changer for the extreme soreness I felt in the tops of my feet .
"Lovely, cool dress.  Thank you!"
I love my cubes and take them everywhere I go when traveling
I usually buy  these socks for a gift for teenage boys. This pair is great! I LOVE how durable they are and just how cool they look. They are a great pattern and I have no doubt that my nephew will love them!
Nice good fit
"I like the combo of the red with the tan/beige at the bottom. Fits as expected, decently comfortable. The one complaint I have is that these are VERY slippery. These seem dangerous to wear during rainy days. I don't know what's going on with the bottom of these shoes, but avoid moisture like the plague."
They are comfortable. They fit. They are classy and I love the black color with the brown heel and bottom. I am happy and can wear them with dresses and jeans. Love.
"gave these to my wife as a gift she loves them, wears them several times a week. the quality is great and they have a nice sparkle."
"Exellent shirt, I ent back and bought another I like it so much.  highly recommended!"
Great quality especially for the price! Its perfect for my 3 yr old.
"Just got this a couple days ago.  Every time my wife flies back to her hometown, it's hit or miss whether her large suitcase will be over or under the 50 lb. weight limit.  This should help, although I haven't tried it yet with a loaded suitcase.

I also had an ulterior motive for purchasing this.  I play, and have several, bass guitars.  Whenever I buy or sell one, the first question usually asked is, ""How much does it weigh?""  Now I'll have a pretty fair estimate.  I weighed my basses this morning, and this scale appears to be pretty accurate.  My only concern is that because there isn't anything on the bass itself to hook onto the hanger part of the scale, I weighed them with the straps on.  But when I tried to weigh one of the straps by itself to see how much weight it added to the total weight of the bass, it isn't heavy enough to register on the scale.  So I'll probably just deduct one ounce from the weight I get of the bass with the strap on.

It does appear to be more accurate with heavier objects like a suitcase.  So all-in-all, I'm glad I got this.  It should be very helpful when flying."
"Looks great, won an ugly sweater contest at work with it. The colors really clash. The hat is pink, not red so it looks pretty awesome.

6'5'' 230, XL was too big in the stomach, too short in the arms but that can be expected with my size.

Only issue was the bottom of the sweater was tighter than the stomach area, so the fabric billowed quite a bit. But awesome quality for a $25 sweater."
"I figured this would be a nice bag, nice color - it's a GREAT bag! It feels well made when you hold it, its got a nice weight to it, and unlike other bargain-priced handbags, it stands on its own and feel sturdy. Before purchasing, I read some of the comments about how it was hard to get into, and yes - the top zip makes the opening a little smaller than it actually is, but it's not an issue at all. I'm planning on buying another in a different color. I purchased the dark pewter, and from the pics it seemed like it would be more gray, and in reality its more bronze than pewter. Still a great looking bag though -"
VERY comfortable and they look great with slacks
Like these pants but won't buy anymore until they are majorly discounted again.
Wife wears it.
The dress fit as described and looked really good. Was very happy with the purchase
These are the softest pants I've ever had. I love them. I plan on buying more pairs. I got them in light purple and they're pretty.
good quality.  soft cotton.
Little tight on top...wearer has skinny legs
My wife likes it alot
Fit but a bit tightly.
Pleased with my purchase.  Comfortable and nice looking for casual or dress.  I purchased a pair years ago and just now needing a new pair.
Im 54 and 150lbs and the large fits perfect. Its not the most amazing quality but it looks great for the price and I only plan on wearing in once anyways
"Cute, cute, cute !  And extremely comfortable.  Loads of compliments."
"Loved it,  realistic"
Cute but exchanging for a size down.
"Great material for costume quality, should last a while.
Buttons put it over the top, great item!"
If you have big eyes the ladies mask is better glued onto a stick. I painted a plastic chopstick with black nail polish and hot glued it on and it worked fine and everyone complimented me on it. The guys mask was perfect!
Very nice. I will get a lot of use from this bag.
Ill be darned if these no show socks don't stay in place.  The first ever I have used that are so small and yet so reliable.  They have a very clever non slip pad on the back of the heal that keeps them nicely in place.  And they are comfortable.  So if you are looking for something that covers to the low back of your heal these are the real deal.  Of note don't get them expecting them to give any friction protection at the top back of the shoe - they are truly no show and don't reach that far up the heal.
"I work for a grocery store, so it means a lot of bending, up and down, puching, pulling  you name it and this beast of shoes has taken it all  even when the are supposed to be office designed.

In simple words the older they get ,the better.

Highly recommend."
Very pretty bark like pattern with nice embroidery. Opaque enough to wear without a slip.pretty enough to wear in public.
Perfect for outside - Work for an NFL team - great jacket as well it keeps you warm.
"these short fit great, feel great and are a steal at the price."
Alfred Dunner always fits as expected. Very good basic pant to wear with a variety of pretty tops.
I bought my usual shoe size (9) but they felt loose and allowed my feet to slide around. I returned the 9s and bought size 8 and they're much better. They have a nice firm sole that provides cushion for my heels (plantar fasciitis) on the tile floor in my house. I think they're going to be perfect.
I had to take it in a bit but it's beautiful and I always get tons of compliments when I wear it!
I've received more compliments for this tie than any other I've worn lately. I'm not a big fan of polyester ties but this one is nicely constructed
Very clean and a good look.....made well and durable.
This was a gift to my wife. She Loves them.
Love this ring very well made
Very happy with socks.
4 stars only because I always buy a size 9 and they were too tight. I returned then and ordered a 1/2 size larger. Cut and comfy now that I have the right size.
Fantastic T-shirt. I'm gonna buy more from this seller.
"I have a few of these now- they are pretty warm (wool and/or fleece is probably a little warmer) and do the trick, plus they're a good price point."
Anuschka never fails to satisfy me especially when brand new.
Perfect storage for those multiple ball caps and hangs behind the door.
Very cute a little smaller than I thought it would be. But happy with it.
"daughter loves them, this is our second pair"
A litte short but i like it its a cute little dress
I got these because I wanted something cute but with foot support.  These are ideal.  Good foot support and nice traction for on floors. Love wearing them around the house and they are fun enough to wear outside if I wanted.  Would buy again.
They're cute and comfy. Great for watching morning games. :)
My boyfriend loved the ring!!! It fit great.
Love the colors and they're working well for my foot temp so my feet don't feel sweaty. I'm a size 7-7.5 and they fit me really well
As expected perfect !!
Great shoes. Always a fabulous fit.
This is great! The fit is a bit big on the bottom but I love it! It's great on its own or with leggings!!
This is an awesome little dress. Well made and fits like a glove. Very forgiving fit!
I loved the dress! My daughter was the flower girl and looked beautiful. Everyone complemented on how pretty the dress looked! It was exactly as pictured. Also she wore an under skirt thing to make it look puffier. I plan on buying more of the exact dress for other occasions. I'm glad they offer different colors. We want them ALL! :)
I bought this to wear under my Wonder Woman costume and it was EXACTLY what I needed.  I wouldn't wear them as plain old shorts but it was perfect for my costume.  I will wear them to lounge around the house in because they are very comfortable.  I usually wear a size 6 so I had no issues with them being too tight or small.
"I bought this to wear gardening, and it works really well.  Keeps the sun off my face and neck, yet is a breathable fabric that doesn't make my head too hot.  I especially like the tie, as it keeps the wind from blowing it off.  It fits a little snugly, but that's better than too loose.  Will probably loosen up over time."
Good boot for grandson
"Love it. I am very picky with  my Brass. I like them to hold me up with no spill over. This
was perfect"
I usually wear size 9.5 wide and that's what I ordered. It fits. I bought it for a wedding and my feet started to hurt after about 5 or 6 hours. By that time I was able to change into more comfortable shoes because they already took all of the wedding pics. The other bridesmaids hate these shoes because their feet started hurting during the ceremony at the church.
"Bought a black Zenana v-neck t-shirt from a Marshall's several years ago and have been slowly wearing it to death. I was super excited to find that I could buy it in a 4-pack, and for a totally reasonable price. The cut is nice and long, it has a good amount of stretch to it and keeps its form beautifully over time, the material is the perfect balance between too heavy and totally see-through, and the neckline is low enough to be interesting without being TOO low. It's even nice enough to dress up for work, but still totally great with jeans and sneakers. Seriously, favorite shirt. :)"
"My son wore this for Easter in the turquiose color- it was a fabulous color, very spring like. My son is a 2nd grader he is 8, however he measures more like a 3rd grader and wears a 10/12 so I ordered it in 12- it fit perfect! Even though he has extra long arms and is very tall nothing about the shirt was short like I read in other reviews! I feel like you should read the size chart carefully and purchase according to what you usually buy and it will fit as expected!!"
"The weather has gotten very cold all of a sudden, and my regular cotton socks aren't quite making the cut with my Chucks. Yeah I know I should use more substantial shoes in cold weather, but since I don't, these socks are great! I'm wearing a pair as I write this review, and my toes are very warm. Highly recommended!"
"This was so cute! We did a plaid themed Thanksgiving, and this was perfect with a pair of black leggings."
Nice product but very small and tight. If i inhale too mich the top buttons pop
"Ordered these in an 8-1/2 for my mom who wears an 8-1/2 or 9.  They are very nice slippers and seem to be good quality and well made, but they were much too large for her ... at least 1/2 a size too large (could fit an entire finger behind the heel.)  I have returned them and the vendor promptly issued a refund (which I appreciate.)  However, it cost over $12 to return ship these slippers (about half of the entire cost) and, in addition, this vendor charges a 20% restocking fee, so I definitely lost money on this purchase (and she still has no slippers.)  I rated these four out of five stars because the slippers seem to be a good product.  Received them fairly quickly and the vendor promptly refunded my purchase (even before receiving the slippers back), but I am not a fan of restocking fees and actually would have just liked to exchange them for a smaller size.  I would rate the vendor slightly less than four stars."
So awesome. Fits great. Very good quality.
I have had these socks in the past and they are very comfortable.  They fit great and their wearability is great too.  I would recommend them highly as I will purchase them again myself in the future !!!
Worth the investment and keeps you really warm!
"Was very cute but the top was a little small on my baby and she kept using her toes to pull the mermaid fin off. So I did not get as good of pictures as I wanted, but the costume was cute."
"I love this little number! The thong is a little big, but I was able to fix it myself! The top is perfectly super tiny! I wear it work and it's one of my faves!"
Best out there.
This dress is so darling. I am 5'3.5 and I weigh 185 it fit my curves perfect. I am very small in the middle and large on the bottom I hope that helps. I wear a 34DD bra size so that might help for people to know what the top was perfect for. I think it is absolutely great. I wore it on a cruise and got tons of compliments I bought it in blue. I would buy this again and other items from this retailer.
I purchased this for my son in law and he loves it.
This necklace is PERFECT. I love it SOO much. My only problem is when it gets tangled because it is very difficult to untangle.
This is the second pair of Lexi Marigold I have purchased. I have both the blue and black sandals. The style goes with dress up and casual.  Will definitely purchase the yellow.
Exceptional quality boots. The color they are online is exactly what I received.
Had to have comfy ridding in summer
"I would give this a 10/10 in both color and fit.  Ok, and pattern.  So soft.  I order plus and am usually 12-16 depending on brand.  These are awesome.  I have 8 of them and will continue to order."
"It fits well and the print proved to handle the washing machine very well.  No tags on the neck area, so it's a plus if you feel discomfort on tags sweeping around your back.  I got what I expected with this shirt."
Love sooo many compliments!
"Excellent quality.  Will need to break them in as they are somewhat narrow, but should loosen with continued wear."
"I like it. A nice cotton blend. I'm 5'3 121 and I bought a small. A bit more lycra to nip and tuck and it would perfect, but it fits wonderfully. Not to tight. Not see through as far as I can tell either."
no more truth could be spoken
"My husband wears flip flops all year round, and wears them out quickly. So I decided to find him something more durable for Christmas, and he loves these !  Even in the house with his pajama pants on, he is wearing these sandals as I type this. Very comfy says my husband. So glad I bought these."
love this shirt. I want it in every color!
"These are great shoes. I used them at the lake and they held up very well. We were on a rocky area, so these kept me from slipping and cutting up my feet. I haven't worn them at the pool so I'm not sure if they're slip resistant on tile, like some of these reviews warn against, but as for the outdoors, they're great. They're comfortable, soft, and cute, too!"
"Good product, for practice loading and feeling trigger.
Seems overpriced though.
You can get many, many times the number of REAL bullets for about the same price."
"I'm in love! Fast delivery and the purse is better than expected. Thick canvas material, excellent craftsmanship, and true to color represented. Amazing price and quality...I'm in love"
"Perfect for a Saturday out and about, lightweight, easy on strap, real leather and the price cannot be beat! 5 Stars!"
Nice shoes. Comfortable. Mom likes them.
"I haven't worn them yet but I did try them on.  I love the way they fit, just hope they're comfortable to wear all day."
BEAUTIFUL! Fits just as expected and the material is luxurious.
"My wife loved it.
I think its a good buy considering the price. It looks stylish..
No foul smell in the bag."
I am more than happy with this dress and excited to wear it to my upcoming wedding!  It is a very flattering fit!
gave as gift.
"Love it...i will most definately buy it again and again.
I just wish they will send it faster.
It took a while to receive."
"Purchased for my mother as she has bunions, calluses and problem nails (she let them get overgrown - I take her to a foot doctor to get her nails cut as they are much too thick for a regular pedicure).  She enjoys them and they are extremely comfortable and her walking has gotten much better.  She really needed the double wide.  I went to many shoe stores but could not find a pair to fit her comfortably."
Cute sunglasses! Just as described!
I must be losing weight! All too big in the waist.
"My husband always have a problem with sneakers, this is the first skecher I bought that fits him perfect. no complaint. will buy another pair."
"The sizing is ridiculous, a size large comes out like a 2xl. I try to shrink my 10 shirts as best as possible but they are still huge. They take daily mechanic abuse though."
I wear 7 1/2 and ordered 8. Sent them back and got a 7 which fit great.
Love at first site! I wore them without washing....yuk I know but they feel so good. I have washed them twice since and them are still yummy. I hope they hold up. I plan to buy other colors. They have not balled up inside which is my fear over time. Time will tell.
This belt is perhaps the most comfortable and best made belt I have ever owned. The material and workmanship are all excellent. the ratchet system used to tighten and loosen the belt work perfectly and is much more comfortable and adjustable than the conventional system used on other belts. I am very pleased with this purchase.
"These boots are industrial-strength, professional grade work boots. The wide sizing fits well with thick winter socks. That's really fortunate because it's lining material is not all that soft and is very rigid. You can get a bit of chaffing or pinching if it's not a perfect fit. That's where the thick socks comes in, great cushions."
"Love the look of this watch,, overall easy to program if you read the instructions. Can't beat it for the price"
"good fit and comfortable, lasts through a lot of washing too."
Love these things! They don't tear easily and they look great
We needed these for my son's dog tags.
"Very nice mask, made with good quality. I ordered this for halloween, and although it took a long time, nearly 3 weeks to receive, it did make it before  halloween. It looks just like the picture, and fits an average size face. They sell the exact same masks at the halloween pop up stores for $6.99 so this is a bargain."
"I Absolutely LOVE, LOVE these bras!  The best fit ever!  I love the material and the fact that the adjustment strap is in the front.  For (6) bras for this price and the comfort feel you won't find no where else.  I'm thinking about buying another pack!"
Absolutely love this! Order for my niece for a birthday present and she was so happy with it. She couldn't be more excited. I was very pleased with the quality. I am going to order one for my daughters.
Very cute and light. Perfect for wearing on my pinkie.
It's best to get the next size up unless you like snug fitting shirts.
"Suprisingly it has some very nice weight to it. I have always been an XL and does fit for an XL, but it is a bit snug. Otherwise i loved it"
Beautiful but I wish it longer.
"Fit perfectly. No problems.
Love it. Thank you."
"Exactly what is shown. I like them, 80s theme party"
"Comfy, with a supportive sole and leather lining so essential when feet sweat in hot weather.  Wonderful alternative to sandals when you want a dressier look with skirts and denims."
"I've lost track of exactly how many of these Green Silence shoes we've bought for my husband over the past several years (beginning, of course, with the bright red/yellow ones that looked like Ronald McDonald shoes).  These shoes have quickly become his favorites; and we now generally order 2-3 pairs at a time.  He finds the shoes to be one step above a minimalist running shoe...comfortable, breathable, and extremely lightweight, and yet well-cushioned.  He wears them for both training and races (marathons, halfs, and 10Ks).  The lifespan of the shoe is pretty good also; he usually gets 300-400 miles out of each pair."
Great shoe. I have a few pairs. Recommend to go a half size less.
Found what I've Been looking for
"i  am addicted to fit flops for comfort !!!... have many pair and always happy with the, !!!  have not been able to wear these yet, as  the cooler temps have kept me waiting !.....  been wearing my gogh navy blue clogs daily !!!"
LOVE  EASY SPIRIT ALL I WEAR. I  ONLY WEAR PLAIN DESIGNS AND THOUGHT I WOULD TRY SOMETHING AND THE PRICE WAS JUST RIGHT.  I ORDER SEVERAL TIMES A YEAR  WHEN I FIND A GREAT SALE.  SO THANK YOU FOR THE QUALITY MAYBE THICKEN THE INNERSOLES..  GREAT DESIGN WITH BLACK LEATHER.
"I own quite a few watches and have a *huge* collection of straps. This certainly isn't the fanciest, but it *is* among the most comfortable, especially for swollen wrists on hot days: I leave the strap a bit on the loose side, but the rubber holds to the skin nicely, and my watch doesn't move at all. One small caveat: It has fairly small holes, so it won't fit over 'fat' springbars."
"Nice fit, nice feel."
"A few years ago I bought the 'better clog bootie' - and just love it.  I have looked at the better clog line ever since (but they are expensive)  So when I saw this shoe at this (greatly) reduced price - I ordered it.  Generally I wear an 8 (even sometimes a 7.5) - in this I wanted/needed the 8.5 (as I did with the better clog bootie).  Could have kept the 8 - but want to be able to have a mid-weight sock.  Anyway - love, love the better clog smooth.  Love the sable brown."
"I bought this for my husband, and he loves it! It fits as expected, and it's very unique. I would definitely buy more in different colors!"
"if you like a classic design, solid construction this is it.  I have had it for several months now and its definitely a winner.  Also, price is unbeatable."
"I was looking for bi-focal sunglasses that I could use with a camera and not have to switch glasses to see the photos. These do very well. The bi-focal lens is attached to the inside of the lens but does not present a problem. Fairly well constructed, good fit with a super hard case for storage."
"These shoes was shown to me by my boyfriend, so I surprised him with them and he love the fit on his feet. They look great with jens or khakis. Thanks"
I'm going to buy them in all colors.  They are more comfortable than my slippers!
I love this tie!  It looks as advertised.  I love the fact that it has paisley and stripes.  It goes good with anything!
"These are the PERFECT shoe for a young toddler!  My daughter is 2 and can easily get them on and off herself.  Additionally, because of the added lip at the front, she can wear them with her Sunday dresses but I don't have to worry about the scuffs.  I only wish they came in several more colors.  These are well worth the money."
"These boots are amazing,they run true to size and there is no need to break them in they are comfortable from the get go. I am an avid down hill skier and as a result I have have large calf muscles and typically have a hard time wearing 12 or 14 inch boots but these fit great. The back laces make them easy to adjust and the side zipper makes it so you don't have to keep adjusting them. I have worn these with pants and skirts they are cute and sassy. I would buy these again :-)"
Very comfortable and very cute. Great for my SC weather.
"A lot of people say that this is big, but it fitted my husband's big head perfectly.  He likes it and  I'm glad I ordered two."
The size chart is off.  Runs bigger than measurements noted in chart.  Otherwise beautiful.
"Love these shoes!  I have them in grey, black/white, and blue/white.  They are light-weight and so comfortable!  I throw them in the wash and hang dry, and they come out good as new."
Adorable and comfy dress for Halloween.
"I have never spent more than 150 for a pair of shoes before, but in my opinion these shoes are worth the price.  I hope they are as durable as other new balance shoes I have worn in the past."
These were  great for a Saint Patrick's Day softball tournament.
Fits as expected but kind of sheer.
"I understand they weren't meant for children, but its hard for me to get my son to wear belts at all. He complains they are either cold to his skin or that when they split, he gets scratched. The quality of cheap or dual leather ones that are far more expensive burns me up."
"This bag is soo nice and it looks expensive, i get a lot of compliments for it. its a little bit smaller than i expected but i still love this bag and it arrived on time"
"I love it, but be careful not to overstuff it with cards or it will stretch. However, it definitely beats my old wallet. If I need to replace this one, I'll definitely consider another just like it."
LOOOOVE IT
"Comfortable fit, love the well positioned, good size pockets. Hope to get a long life  out of these pants."
Very Happy. Feel so good and comfortable! Fit as expected. Thank you!
Perfect for my husband. He likes them.
"Fit me like I wanted it too, felt weird at first, but now it's better. My arms are so long so the sleeves are a bit short, but that's expected."
"Great feel, great fit, great look.  I am very pleased!"
"Great product. Easy to use, flap makes identifying information more discreet, but the bright color made my luggage easier to identify when retrieving it at the airport. Would recommend."
So baggy. Love them
"I purchased this bag to go out of town last minute for work. I wanted something leather for sure. I was looking around and found this. The size was right. It had a shoulder strap and I like the texture and grain of the leather. Bag is awesome. Seems like it will last for a very long time with some basic leather treatment. Only thing I would have like to have is the lockable zip pulls for when this bag has to be checked on a flight. I just used some strong zip ties to keep the zippers closed.

Overall 5 Star Duffel Bag."
Fun SHIRT!
They are adorable and very absorbent. Highly recommend these.
"The shoes fit perfectly!
I am a first time buyer to this brand. Comfortable just like putting my feet into patted or cushion like sneakers.
Usually in the store you can look on the in side of a shoe and see the size. So normally I would see the half sizes printed 9 1/2 for my size.
But on line the sizes for me are 9.5 D(M) US and that was a good guess on my part. Maybe the sellers can explain what the M,D and E stand for, because it clears the doubt for those aren't familiar with these letters. Which might bring in a lot more sales with people having to know rather than not be sure."
I liked the quality and style of the pants but was uncomfortable with the fitment I may try them in another size. They were a little more snug than I anticipated compared to other Levis that I own.
When those cold winds blow this is very comfy.
I got this for my daughter and she loves it...there's an odd smell so wash before wear and air out a couple days.
"could be a bit bigger, but handles a standard size western hat ok; overall, very nice for the price"
Nice shoe.  I just tried on for a short amount of time around my home to test the size.  So far so good but I have not worn the shoe for any extended period of time.
worked exactly as needed
We live in California so it doesn't rain that much. But so far this umbrella has worked out just fine. My son loves it!
Actually love this wrap for my post csection support. I would give it 5 stars if it was longer.
"I have really sensitive ears, but I've had these in for a couple months now with no issues. I love them! The size is a little large for me for everyday use, but that's my fault for not checking the size. They don't bother me, so I'm happy with them."
"soft, flowy material, waistband fits perfectly at the waist.. think it should look nice paired up with a plain top. falls a bit above ankles on 5""5."
"This costume is super cute, my daughters in a 3T and the x-small fit perfectly. My only complaint would be there's a crease in the hair piece from being folded in the package but hopefully I'll be able to fix it. She was super excited to try it on and didn't want to take it off!"
"These are awesome!  my husband immediately commented on how much he liked them before I even had them zipped up! lol very comfortable, thinking of getting a second pair."
great slippers seco d pair first pair wore out was hoping to get the family guy but nothing this comfortable u cant beat these homers.....  weere are my homers the floors cold u will be saying
I love these sandals.  I am wearing them right now.  Comfortable to the extreme.
"These socks are so comfortable, and they maintain their color so well! I wear them all the time, and I will defiantly be buying these again!"
Cool golf shoes
"These arrived, I put them on, and went straight out on a run. They are excellent running shoes, good looking, and as a tend to put weight on the sides of my feet, made me feel as if I had finally arrived in the best shoe for me. Asics just earned a 40 year Nike customer, even my knees felt great. I have been running since before running shoes were invented, and these are hands down the best shoes I have ever put on. I hope they last the hundreds if miles I will put on them, but that is another review."
"I love this dress! Great fit, great quality and so pretty!"
"I ordered a large and it fits fine. A little snug for my preference but that's a personal preference. Most would find
The fit is as it should be. If I lose 3-5 more lbs will fit to my liking. Order according to your true size. I wear 12. Usually order 12-14"
"The Amazon Collection offers this pretty 18k gold (over rhodium) multi-gemstone bracelet seven and a half inches long. Pretty, but a bit snug on the average ladies wrist this bracelet holds quite an assortment of pretty mineral samples like: topaz, amethyst, peridot, garnet, citrine & white topaz. As to the ultimate design of the piece, the stones are firmly set w/ 4 prongs onto the bracelet, while I wasn't thrilled by the bracket's closing-clasp, it's not over user-friendly, but if your lady doesn't  mind calling in an extra pair of hands (I.e. YOU) while putting on your jewelry it goes on fine. Overall we liked it, for the price and the quality of materials it's alright."
"Got these as a gift for my 10yo niece. The looked nice and were the perfect size. I had to repackage them to gift them because they came in individual plastic bags placed in a drawstring bag- I put them in a box with cotton. I can't review how they feel in the ears or whether they caused any sensitivity- I will update if my niece has any comments or concerns. They open and close easily but securely. Overall I was very happy with the,- especially for the price."
"The shorts are what I expected, given past experience with carhartt.  The other reviewer was right about it being long enough for tall guys.  I am pretty tall, and the length is perfect in that it covers my legs all the way to the knees, but not below.  I carry a limited number of tools, and a telephone, and constantly get in and out of a vehicle, for my job and these have very well designed pockets for carrying a few hand tools, out of the way so they don't stab the truck seat.  The truly unique and excellent features of carhartt are attention to detail, and sparing no expense for quality.  However, I hope I haven't spoken too soon, as we shall see how long they last."
These are great for summer & exactly what I was looking for!!
Better than expected.. Grandson loved!!!
"These little pants are plenty long enough, but I was worried that they would be too tight in the waist since he is a little chunky (25lbs @ 9 mos, breast fed). The elastic is narrow & not to strong ( tightly woven) so elastic is quite forgiving, enough to get him through the winter in NC mtns. He looks adorable in them! ( of course!) The material is cotton, soft, not too thick, but enough to keep his little chunky legs warm"
"just love this skirt..the way it flows,, feels, fits! Perfect! washes well when hung to dry. can wear it to work, then change top for something mare dressy to go out in. well made, comfy, durable..highly recommend. great price too."
Love them and got lots of compliments. easiest heals to walk in!
"This suit is SUPER cute and way better quality than I expected, considering how inexpensive it was. It fits well, and the top is snug enough that you could wear it as a bandeau (the straps are removable) without it failing on you. The bottoms are rouched on the sides, which gives it a bit of flair & forgiveness. While the bottoms come up as high as in the picture, I was *slighty* disappointed that the top is not as long as it appears in the picture. That being said, it's still a great top & one that I can easily mix & match with other bottoms. Again, for the price, totally exceeded expectations (which is even higher praise since no one likes bathing suit shopping)!

Note: I also originally posted a picture of the bathing suit - similar to all the others on here - with my review, but Amazon deemed it somehow, outside of their review guidelines."
I like them a lot. Very comfortable and fit grest.
These are the best for running around in the house during winter.
"While I ordered this light pink shoe I received a darker pink shoe in a different style.  I was disappointed as they were supposed to match our daughter's Easter dress, but it was a surprise gift, and she absolutely loves them.  These are very well made, and as we have 3 girls and I expect them to last.  Bought my other daughter some purple ones at the same time and received the correct item."
"Love my robe. I only had issues with the tag behind my neck. I had to cut it out because it scratches but other than that, love the robe"
"These attractive open-filigree silver dome earrings are hollow so although they are a relatively large 1/2 inch in diameter, they are light in weight and comfortable to wear all day long. They are nicely finished with no rough edges.

The posts are a generous 1/2 inch in length, are securely attached and the post length should be a good fit for most ear lobes. These are a classic style that should not go in and out of fashion and they look good dressed-up and dressed-down. Small size metal earring backs are included along with a sturdy gift box."
Cute and versatile. Great fit. Comfortable for high heels. Easy to walk in.
"Really like the fit it I'd very flattering for tall people with a large midsection as well as pregnant people..not a fan of the diagonal pocket on the left hand side though. Overall it is great though....I wear 3x-4x and it gives me some shape rather than being a box, I also have a longer body so I love maternity clothes they just fit better!"
"Very attractive and solidly constructed.  A little narrow toward the toes and might need a little more support and padding at the heels, but otherwise quite satisfactory.  These are probably the best reasonably price slipper of its type available."
"Napoleon has a cameo appearance in our theatre production and I opted for the Elope Napoleon Hat over cheaper alternatives, and I'm very glad I did. The hat is substantial, not flimsy, and is generously sized to fit an adult's head. Too often I've purchased cheap costume hats and found them to be too small to be useful.

The hat is actually a tricorne turned around, not the traditional Napoleon bicorn, but I see that as a plus. If needed, it can be turned around and used for George Washington or a British Naval Officer or the like."
Great light weight beach/workout tank
Very nice outfit!!!
This is the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn. I travel for work and I spend a lot of time in airports. I call these shoes my airport shoes. The leather is soft. The style  is cute. I love Taos and my endless search for the Right shoe is finally over.  Taos is my brand for comfort.
The socks are very nice for the price.
Super cute and comfy. This is only my second pair of TOMS but I really like them.
"I was hesitant that I wouldn't like this when it arrived but I absolutely love it! It is made with a soft material, very nice coloring. If they had the same scarf with other major cities and landmarks I would most definitely buy those as well!"
"They are fine, expected them to be!!The best part is shopping on line as I have a problem walking.  Thanks Amazon."
Comfortable and true to size fit.  No complaints!
Flattering and cute.
baught it as a christmas gift....my grandmother fell in love with it.
got these for my daughter and they are absolutely darling!  i had to exchange for a size up though.... i think the brand must run a bit small as i had to do the same for a pair of saucony's for myself.  EASY to exchange and the new shoes fit perfectly.
My sister won't take it off!
Very comfortable  shoe.
So far very good.  We'll have to see how long they last.
great fit nice style
"SO cute! It fits the bust and just floats over my belly, hiding everything. I feel really pretty in this top."
Very cute on .  Fits well and washes well.
"Your back can be in pain the first few days wearing it. I suggest only for a few hours at a time spread out.

That being said, it works amazing, just as advertised, my only complaint are the sleeves are too long to hid under my short sleeve dress shirts."
Very nice wallet. Made very well and should last for years.
"Good fabric, seemed large."
I have yet to test these out in the field but so farvthey fit well.
"My kid loves this belt, a much better alternative to the adjustable, elastic baseball belts out there."
The fit is very good for me as they have the hidden expansion waist line that expands and contracts right along with me...  ;-)  I would recommend them as decent dress pants as long as you aren't expecting suit material...
Great wallet. Perfect for traveling.
Very comfortable. Had to get used to feeling as if I was walking on sponge but like them now.
I got these for a friend and he says they fit perfectly. He lives on a beach and says he also wears them basically everyday.
"I have a pair of Dansko clogs that are my favorite shoes. Unfortunately, the finish does not allow for regular shoe polish (the polish actually removes MORE of the finish than adding anything to it).

I was so happy when I found this paint because I can now have my clogs look nice again! I've sprayed them with Black, Red and Navy Blue, and they've turned out great each time. With one coat it lasts for about 8 months before I start seeing scuff marks and need to redo it.

This is been a life-saver. I thought I was going to have to get rid of these shoes.

This will be the first time I'm purchasing this off Amazon. The first few times it was through my local shoe repair shop, which charged me twice the price. So, it'll be great to get it a little cheaper too."
Same excellent quality as my old Rolfs - it lasted over 20yrs.  Hope this does the same
Good style and low price.  What's not to like.  I will buy again.
"Loved this bday gift! UA is all the rage for athletes, so my son was stoked for this. It is medium, so to me a perfect size. Not too big, not too small. Will definitely buy again."
"I am a teacher and these are my go-to almost daily. I teach Animal Science, so I am often required to get my feet wet/dirty and these put up with just about anything. They are super cute with a small heel, and very water resistant, although not as effective as a rubber boot. I can wear these all day and they don't bother me. I will be buying them in additional colors. I wear a size 10 and these were true to size. I just can't wear super thick socks, otherwise my toes get scrunched a bit in the toe."
Highly recommend this seller! Very cute product!
Gorgeous! Excellent quality
"I love these tanks.  Very nice material and form fitting.  They're not cheap, but in this case I believe you get what you pay for."
"Regular fit, true to size and length,not tight legged but the loose fit style is way too sloppy looking."
"I wish I knew about this kit uears ago, it could've saved dozens of white shoes I owned. This takes minimal effort and turned my shoes around in minutes! I have bought many kits in stores but after using this I will never go back!"
Comfortable...like walking on a cloud
Such a pretty ring.  Very petite so mightbe better on smaller fingers.
These are really nice pants that look good and fit well at a price well below what you pay for dress trousers in big name men's stores.
Nice backpack!  Sturdy and holds toys well and makes a great toddler diaper bag. It has Everest and Skye on it which pleases my toddler. Her brother wishes the boy versions had them as well.  He's five and questions the sexist separation of these two characters from all the other pups on products.
My mom loved these slippers. Highly recommended.
"This is an amazing purchase and my husband and I could not be happier!

We just got married November 2015 and spent our honeymoon in HI. While visiting Kona, we came across a local jewelry store that sold koa wood rings. We both agreed to wait until our one year anniversary and get each other a koa wood ring since they were so pricey ($200-$1000). So when I had the opportunity to purchase this koa wood ring at a discount for my honest and unbiased review, I jumped on it!

It arrived quickly and was well packaged. The ring came in a nice, masculine ring box. I took a look at it and thought it looked just as nice as the more expensive versions in Hawaii. I could not wait to give it to my husband yesterday! He was excited, then concerned that I just spent hundreds of dollars! I laughed and explained to him that I almost felt ""cheap"" by spending so little!

He loves it and said to give it 5 stars. I ordered an 8.5 (his 8.75 wedding band is slightly large) and it fit perfectly! In fact, he said he most likely will wear this ring on a daily basis in place of his wedding band, saving that for more special occasions.

The koa wood has a beautiful rich color and grain. The bevelled edge is a nice touch. The 8mm width does not feel bulky to him (his wedding band is 7mm and loathed 8mm when we searched for his wedding band). Surprisingly, it does have the comfort fit design, which was unexpected.

Since it is tungsten, I expect the ring to last a long time. We are thoroughly satisfied with this ring and is a steal at any price they have listed. I would highly recommend this, especially if you long for the Hawaiian islands like we do.

Now, let's see what he gets me! ;)"
"Love Stance socks. not too thick. they grab your feet/ankles nicely, so no socks that are falling down. and the styles/colors are super stylish."
Luv this shirt !!! Fits me perfectly and is very comfortable. Luv the tagless back. Will order more of these in different colors.
Heart in heart.  My family loves it.
This is a very cute sandal and fits extremely well!!  I have always had great success with the FitFlop brand!!
this is perfect ~ it goes very well with several tops i have
LOVE SO COMFY
"I love this robe. It is super soft, warm and luxurious. Definitely recommend this as a purchase."
"It's ok, not too bad, cotton,somewhat slim design."
The most comfortable boots I ever had on my feet.
"Looks good, accurate"
Very pleased. Goddess work jeans
Lots if pockets!
This is an eye catching shirt. A great quality T-shirt with the 2nd Amendment Skull logo printed front and back. It makes a great statement. Equal to it's Ad and reasonable price for the quality. Thanks for the great buy!
Like the style. Works well for me who has flat feet.
Beautiful ring set. The finish is gorgeous and I love it. Looks great on my hand and everyone thinks it's real and comments on how beautiful it is!
"Slippers are great, but the quality is less than desired. This is my third pair and I find the need to replace every year due to ripping that occurs from use. That's why I'm giving it only 4 stars."
"I love buying us polo clothing on Amazon because it's a great brand and they sell it for cheap prices so I don't have to spend a ton of money to have my son dressed nicely. I got this in the orange color because my son normally wears red, black, or blue and wanted something different in his wardrobe."
"Dress is perfect, however, check the seeming one the sides because you may need to grab a needle and thread to patch up a hole or two!!"
They are all cotton so will shrink a little when washed.
"I had never heard of this brand and with free returns and a great price I gave it a try.  It is a firm cork base, with a deep heel cup, and rigid sole.  It also has great arch support and adjustable straps.  I have a thicker ankle and was pleased there was ample strap. These remind me of a Naot in quality, and construction with perhaps even better support."
My daughter really like this watch.
shirt fits great bought it for my sons birthday
This purse is so soft and still able to carry all you need I love it
"AWESOME! I wasn't sure about these, but I love them. They have sparkle, and are the size for any adult."
"Trying a new size with these. Other than the heel being a little too wide, they'll do just fine for my once in a while use. ONE note, these shoes are rather pointy which I wish they weren't for style's sake."
Love Fly London!
"This bra fits well, is estetically pretty and it is comfortable. Just wish they had better colors. The champagne color is more of a light peach. And the beige color is a dark taupe. Please improve your colors!"
my wife feels like a punk rocker in these.
"I'm shocked at how beautiful and nicely made this dress is for under $40. Sure there are 1-2 things that you can see weren't done like a $100 dress, (like an unfinished hem at the bottom) - but at under $40 I don't care in the least!  Nobody is going to be staring at your he in this dress.  Wow.  I bought a 1x:  I am 5'5"", no hips, have a belly, size 16ish, and a 44"" chest.  This dress went on easily - but without something to slim out my lines, it just wasn't a match made in heaven.  If you have a smoother figure - or aren't as vane as me, this dress would be lovely.  I'd recommend it, even!  It's really pretty and could be used for a lot of occasions.  For the price, quality, and what you're getting - 5 stars."
I love these shoes. Very comfortable. So comfortable that I bought them in 3 colors.
Love this shirt. Nice soft material.
"A very nice and very light walking shoe. Normally I wear a 9 1/2 or 10. but when I reorder another Skecher shoe it will be a 10 1/2, the size 10 is a little tight in the toes.
 I do recommend and will buy more of this product."
"Just like my 8 other kipling bags, very roomy, great quality, vibrant color very light weight even with my everyday stuff in it. Love it!"
I have the most sensitive ears ever and was worried I wouldn't be able to wear these.  I've worn them everyday since they arrived last week with no issues!!  I love the small size.
"Beautiful!!!

It fits true size... well made and excellent quality as usual in frye shoes; i really love them... thanks amazon!!!"
"Below is the review of the orange Teva with the black footbed.  This all-blue one is almost the same, but the straps are looser.  The blue straps do not seem as sturdy as the orange woven straps.  However, I still like them.  If I buy another pair (and I might because I love them), I will probably buy the ones with the black footbeds.
*I bought a smaller size than normal.  I usually wear a 10, but bought a 9 because the length of the footbed was the same length as the footbed of a size 8 Teva Men's Universal Sandal that I already own.  The footbed is fine, but the straps are a little tight.  They are stretching though, and I think they are going to be fine after a couple of weeks.*"
Very nice fitwell nice cotton shirt grandson loves it
"I ordered a half size larger after reading
reviews and the fit was perfect.  Lots
of cushioning in the heels which is an issue for me because of plantar fasciitis.
Got a sale price which helps. Only complaint is laces are very short."
"I bought this for my son - 2 1/2 years, but small for his age. He weighs about 24 lbs, and it fits perfectly. The felt hood is about what I expected - sewn felt in a conical, hood shape with no straps. This would literally blow off his head if he walked past a fan. However, the addition of some velcro tape and a plastic Darth Vader mask will match everything up perfectly.

Why 4 out of 5 stars is only because the leg closures (diaper-changing necessity!) have velcro tabs. I took it to a tailor to have those replaced with snaps and problem solved. Cost me $5. If you are handy, you could probably do this yourself for less, but I am not handy. The velco on the legs is a problem because the rest of the fabric readily adheres to it - kid takes two steps, and his legs are bare. But, with that exception, it really is perfect!"
my son stole this shirt from me. gits as expected
"The headband works perfectly at keeping the sweat out of my eyes. I have a large head and I was worried that it would be to tight and give me a head ache,  but the material stretched perfectly and was to tight."
Love this dress so much the product is so nice so I advice who so ever wanna buy it should go ahead
"These are feel really nice.  Love the fur inside and really comfortable.  Haven't had major snow since I received them, but have no doubt they would be great."
My 7 year old loves them!
Most comfortable sneaker I've worn as of late... On my feet all day and my feet thank me for buying these AGAIN!!!
"These boots seem very sturdy and undestroyable, and of high quality. True to size. The leather is thick and very nice looking and the details (stamping and lace hooks) are pretty. The soles are very (unusually I would say) thick. I really liked the leather lining - silky and so soft, you won't hurt your bare ankles wearing shorter socks.

I only wore the boots around the house, so I can't comment on how they hold up, though I'm sure they would do a superior job. I returned them because they are VERY heavy. I was going on vacation intending to walk for hours (8+) every day - I thought that these would make my legs tired sooner. I tried on many hiking boots before leaving and weighed all of them. Most were 13 oz, one or two pairs 16 oz, these were 19. Doesn't sound like a big deal, I know. But I could really feel the weight. 6 extra oz per step, thousands step per day - I think it would add up.

I chose Anhu Montara in Red Mahogany and fell in love with them during my vacation, never wanted to take them off! My second choice was Merrell Azura Carex in wine color (yes, I did want boots in as close to red color as possible) but I didn't believe their soles and they were not vibram. These Teva boots were my third choice.
For colder weather or really tough hikes I would choose Keen Gypsum. I was so sorry to let them go! So comfortable. I'm still thinking about getting them back."
"Very light and of good quality, added benefit of being waterproof. They were a gift and the recipient liked them very much."
Cute jeans that fit my daughter nicely. She can be hard to find jeans for at times. I will buy Levi's again for her.
I love this wrap and wear it both with my swimsuit and as a scarf with normal outfits. The color is beautiful as well and didn't fade at all.
"People told me to buy icebreakers to keep me warm, i did.  I got the best they had to offer.  They didn't keep me warm.
However, the Duofold worked great!!!  I live in an area where the temps drop to 15F, these kept me warm.  I absolutely love them!!"
I always buy sebago but the color wasn't the way I expected
"Very nice looking shoes, very comfortable and light on my feet. CAT did a good job with these. Holding them alone even they feel they are built tough but in a way that does not compromise style and comfort.  Does not feel like safety shoes at all. My previous safety shoes were a Red Wing, felt like a brick on feet. I would even wear them for everyday activity."
"It's exactly as pictured and has long enough adjustable strap things to work for taller folk (I'm 5'10"") The bow is also super easy to remove if that's not your thing. It does a perfectly fine job of holding up stockings, so no complaints"
"Yay!!! Thanks to everyone's reviews I was able to order the Large. I am 5'4 and 170 and it fits perfectly. The length is great. These skirts are not meant for you to bend over but to kneel down like a lady so think about that. Fabric is light and almost swimsuit like, I could see it may snag easily, other than that very happy with it!  Oh and shipping was crazy fast.. Like it took 3days?!? But told me 3weeks or so?"
Nice to keep feet warm in winter months.
"Bought these for my mom and she adores them! One day as she was wearing them in a grocery store, she noticed a stranger kept following her closely through the store with her phone out, looking at Mom. The lady finally came up to Mother and said she kept trying to get a good picture of the shoes she was wearing because she thought they were so cute! So of course, Mom posed for a ""footsie"" picture! So the moral of the story is, these shoes are so cute, strangers may follow you! Plus, they are extremely comfortable she says. These are the 2nd Bernie Mev shoes she's worn."
"After couple of disappointing pairs of Sorel boots I ordered these as I love my Keen sandals. The boots fit as I expected, they look so cute with skinny jeans & are lovely & cosy warm."
One glove was sewn at a slight angle and was difficult to keep it straight... still worked out great.
Light weight shoe with hard foam soles. My 5 year old loves them.
Wonderful shoe for 8 hours on your feet. I think they would be good for any type of foot problem.
It's pretty good. The size is fine.
"I ordered this top in burgundy and the color looks just like it does in the picture. I'm 5'1, 105 lbs, and the small small fits great. It's loose-fitting (but not baggy) and it naturally slides off one should when I wear it, which I think makes it look subtly sexy. Great buy."
An amusing gift for a women who golfs.
Good fit. Prompt shipment.
I bought these for my wife and she loves them. Good polarized lenses. Very light and comfortable.
"As someone with wide feet, it's very difficult to find shoes that aren't sneakers that are comfortable and durable. These shoes have preformed very well in the rain, snow, and sun. I wouldn't wear them to walk directly through a swamp, but they keep my feet dry when walking to class in a downpour or walking across a damp grassy area. When it snowed here the traction provided by the rubber sole held up really well on the ice, and all I needed were fuzzy socks to keep my feet warm. When I wore them on a warm day my feet didn't feel sweaty at all. I can throw these shoes on with leggins, jeans, or a skirt and they look wonderful. In addition, they look so much nicer than sneakers. I'm usually out an about from 7:30 am to around 10pm and these shoes are so much more comfortable than most flats. Definitely worth the price. A nice plus is that even though I have walked through countless damp fields and mulchy pathways, these shoes don't look droopy at all.
The color on my shoes is exactly like the picture. They arrived quickly and broke in in about 4 days. They are the perfect everyday shoe for me. I would recommend these shoes to anyone!"
"I purchased this luggage to take with me on an 18 day luxury cruise to the South Pacific and I must say I am very happy with this buy. Although I did not need the smallest piece, my daughter and I did need to get two luggage sets as we used the two largest pieces from each set and we packed just what we wanted and needed.

This luggage set is very well built. You the buyer need not worry about the ability of the luggage to hold up to the stress of whatever handling it will receive in transit from airport to airport, etc. The look of the luggage is fantastic and the price cannot be beat. It is difficult for me to imagine that I paid less than three hundred dollars for this set as I feel that I should have paid much more for the quality and look of this superior luggage set.

Luggage is a requirement when doing some travel and your luggage will get beat up and will not look new after as little as one trip to and from your destination. It is helpful to have an understanding when purchasing nice luggage that your fantastic looking brand-new luggage doesnt look that way anymore after just one flight. I expected this going in because some of the luggage reviews here listed complaints along that line. This London Fog luggage set has the right color to hide some of the wear and tear it will get being tossed about on your vacation or business trip. It is the quality of the build that is most important. The material is nice and thick as are the zippers that hold everything together. This luggage will stand the test of time and you will be very happy with the way it moves while you are scooting it along the airport terminals. It rolls very smoothly with little effort, and that my friends is the one bonus that you will truly appreciate in transit. Nothing worse than luggage that wears you down while you try to move it and yourself through corridor after corridor at the airports.

London Fog is rugged, glides smoothly along with you while you walk, looks amazing--making you look better (eat your heart out), costs you very little to own, and is easy to find at the baggage claim because you are the only person at the airport that day with luggage that dashing!"
perfect for my passport and global entry documents. When traveling I use it for boarding passes & luggage receipts. It is of good quality & the distinctive color makes it easy to find in my bag.
Get it with the matching backpack if your taking them to school. It looks hella cool and you'll get compliments everywhere you go. ITS CRAZY!!!!
"True to size. I'm a 9-10 in women, so I got a 8 in men. Fit just right. The slides are pretty comfortable, too."
These are thick and soft and retain their integrity after washing.  Highly recommended.
"Love Vionic shoes, have several pairs"
Very nice product.  It's exactly what I wanted
I love this shirt!! The fit is perfect and the fabric feels great. I have a few other Patty Boutik shirts and this one is by far my favorite
"I've purchased the Fruit of the Loom Men's Pocket T Undershirts a few times, and I'll keep buying them as long as they don't change. I'm generally a Jeans and T Shirts kind of person, and I can get away with wearing these as my everyday shirts because of the various colors and the pocket. They don't look like underwear. Above all else, the Fruit of the Loom Men's Pocket T Undershirts are light weight and comfortable! I don't do hot weather very well, and I'm outdoors quite often. The regular T Shirts hanging on the store racks are nice, as are the multi-packs of white cotton T's, but they're just too darn heavy for me. I highly recommend the Fruit of the Loom 4 pack of Men's Pocket Tees."
Omg super cute and soft! Love this little outfit..
"I purchased this watch as a gift, need it in one week time. It arrived on time, great watch, price, an d in general great deal. Recommended for personal use and as a gift"
"I love these socks!  I have bunion problems and arthritis in my toes.  I spent $50 a long time ago on gel separators and did not like them at all...too hard to put on.  I had another pair of socks similar to these and wore them out.  In the evening, when my feet are tired and achy, I put these on for about an hour and my feet feel so much better!  I am trying to avoid surgery by keeping my big toe from ""hammering"" and they are working.  You will not be disappointed!"
"My friends all wear Sperry shoes and have pressured me into purchasing my first pair ever. I am so glad I gave into that peer pressure as these are the best boat shoe I have ever owned. They are a nice look and feel. You do have to break them in, but for me it only took about 3 wears and they wear perfectly. I wear these to work and expected my feet to hurt in them midway through the day and was very wrong in thinking that. I can wear theses shoes all day and not have my feet hurt at all! I look forward to my next purchase of Sperry's very soon!"
This is a nice and comfortable sweater. The color is so nice and pretty and it was exactly what I expected. I got it a little big and it was just a little big.
Absolutely beautiful Link Bracelet. My husband loves it and wears it alot and he's not a jewelry person.
Good quality hat for the price. Exactly as advertised!
"Nice, solid twill capris but don't be mislead by the stetch claim. They are definitely not stretch. They fit as expected, a little snug when pulling them up but good fit once on the waist. Made of classic Dickies cotton twill and they feel very durable. My girlfriend bought these as work pants but she will probably get some use out of these while hiking or kayaking, too."
had to sew up the sides (slits) but fits great
"I was really impressed with this set. I don't know anything about watch repair, so i can't speak to the quality of  the tools but they seem really nice to me. Buying the set was cheaper than paying to have two watches resized. The set worked perfect for what I wanted it for."
"Looks very cute on my daughter. Thicker, heavy material that is somewhat ichy so prepare to wear something under it."
"The band is exactly as advertised, and priced exceptionally well.  I am very pleased with it, and it is the only one I found in this size.  I don't care for larger bands."
Perfect shapeware to slim you all over
Nice dress. Haven't wore it yet. But nice fit and love how it feels on
"This dress fits great and looks good.  It's very comfortable and the length is just below kneecap on my 5'3"" frame."
This shirt is very soft.  It's one of my favorites to wear when lounging because of that.  I bought the shirt for a pirates shirt day.  I don't think this is what they had in mind.  I find it hilarious.
My grandson loves them ! He says more comfortable than the converse we usually ourchase.
"I bought this for my friend for his birthday. It's a great summer hat as it is a very open weave and lets your head breathe while wearing it. Something that wasn't obvious immediately, the back is lightly knit to have a scrunched look. It isn't a smooth texture all around and is pinched, but it is still stylish and comfortable to wear. It just has a distinct front and back, which isn't that common for a beanie without a logo or image."
Nice top for your money.
These fit a little bigger than I was expecting but I'm still able to wear.
Very good bag for the bike.
"I typically wear a size 10-12 or M to L in tops. I ordered this in a medium and it just fits. It's not too tight, but there is not much room to spare. Since I plan to wear it under a cami the fit is fine."
"I'm a size 12/14 and these fit so well. They do not show any separation in the fibers when they stretch out, so even on my bigger body, they fit perfectly. The material is soft and warm. The colors are vibrant. These seriously rock. Check out the photo to see for yourself."
"I wound up buying these in 6 different colors while they were on a crazy reduced sale over Thanksgiving. They fit well. Maybe a fraction smaller than other kd shoes, but it's no problem The only thing was one of the colors I ordered was black patent, and they substituted black smooth leather instead. Don't get me wrong, they are very nice. But I have like a billion pairs of black smooth leather high heels, and didn't really need another (or can one not have enough?). I would have preferred that Amazon acknowledged the problem ahead of time and gave me a choice. I actually then would have ordered a different color. But oh well, I got 6 pairs of Kelsi pumps for about a total of $160. Pretty nice. xox"
When I took them all out I didn't think a lot of them were gonna fit some of them look to small some of them look too big but I tried all of them on and they all fit perfect
BONITO PERO UN POCO GRANDE
I ordered extra large because other reviews said it ran small. Should have just got the large it doesn't run small. I gave it to my Mom and she loved it. Very cute and a nice tailored fit!
I had purchased another model of watch winder and one of the components was not turning anymore. My husband had 3 watches and I had one that needed this motion. This model not only solved the problem but looks very nice on his bureau. The wood grain  matches our furniture and looks  more expensive than it really was.
"Bought this for my fianc since I'm always schlubbing around in robes, and was shocked how much he loves it! ""Is this a man-robe"" he asked? WHy yes! So comfy, and fit is great I would buy him 6 more if he'd let me"
Fits great! I love it and get lots of compliments on it! It's very warm and thick so it's great for the cold!
Exactly what I wanted for work without the hassle of going to malls and not having my size.
"This bra fits well. The coloring is nice and will be invisible under most clothes. It shapes the bustline nicely as compared to many wire-free bras. Deducted a star because it creates little triangles of fat at the armpit, which are annoying. Otherwise, a comfortable, well made, supportive choice for women who hate wires."
"Very comfy and toasty.  Great for dog walking or city walking.
Have a feeling they will be good for one season only."
"These are some of the best silk shawls and scarfs that I've seen!! The colors and the quality are superb! They feel so soft and are great to wear with everything. I love them so much, I bought more. And on top of everything else, they're going towards a good cause. A+++"
Very nice shade Pink.  I like the fit and it is soft. I might buy another one in a different color.
gift for grandchild
i love this bag.  it is large enough for all my purse things and can even hold a book too!  i would recommend this to any aged gal and feel that she'd be happy.
Very good quality of product.
Its a little long but great quality.
Even prettier than in the picture. Perfect fit.
"My husband loved his ring and the price. All his friends compliment it because it doesn't look cheap at all. If you (and your husband) aren't picky about brands or pricey jewelry, get this band for your hubby and he'll love it. It hasn't gotten scuffed up either, so the metal holds up well. Might be a different story if you're in the construction field though, so take that into consideration."
Perfect shorts for summer at the beach!
Got it for my toddlwr to take to play school. It is sort of big for my 2 plus year old toddler. But she loves dragging it. And it is very light. It is a good buy! Good quality too
"Great costume, fits ok, only concern is the belt, a little tight for size Large. I need extend it with velcro"
"It fits well and seems very expensive, but the price is acceptable. I think it's for taller person, but for me it also good."
I bought this ring for my brother.  He wears it whenever he goes out.  I guess that means he likes it!
Very flowy and pretty. Sheer through and through so you need to wear a tank top underneath. Mine was more purple than it was blue and the flower print was off to the side instead of dead center like the photo. still like it though!
On time..soft and comfortable fabric.
Love this...only problem is that it either came with a small hole at wrist or was so easily torn I don't know how it happened
"NICE BOOTS FOR MOTORCYCLE RIDING, FLEXIBLE, COMFORTABLE AND WILL KEEP THE WATER OFF YOUR TOES IN HEAVY RAIN AT 75 MILES AN HOUR"
"I just found out I'm pregnant so my review will not be at all biased because I DIDNT FIT....HaHa But it is VERY soft and comfortable, and very cute! Once I have the baby I can't wait to lose the weight to jump into this! Very excited!"
I love these! Exactly what I was looking for!!!
"Good value, supportive"
Exactly as pictured. Very fast shipping. It's perfect!
I love these shoes. But I always order a half size up in DC and that matches my normal size in other shoes.
"I have two pairs of these, and they are so comfortable! I usually wear an 8.5 or a 9. The 8.5 in these fit great!"
Amazingly low price for nice shirt.
Great fit. Wish Puma didn't end it's line of production with so many products so quickly. Looks good with a matching pair of shorts or running pants.
"I like this nightie a lot but I had an issue with the fabric at front of the yoke. The way they gathered the fabric there made it very bulky and they left a lot of the fabric there all bulky so I took it upon myself to trim some of the bulk and I just had to put a few stitches there where I made a mistake and was a bit overzealous with my approach but it turned out great and I happen to like that nightie out of the many I do have. So if you also find that the fabric right there  between your greats is too bulky you can trim it just be very careful and don't go overboard but if you ca sew a few stitches then by all means go Florida it because it felt perfect free that.its the ""price""lol you pay for buying online. I'd rather do that as I not someone that likes to shop I feel it's a waste of my valuable time."
This pants are true to size and they fit really well. They are rather heavy cotton and they seem very durable. Great product and we got them at really good price in Amazon.
"I wanted to be Little Red Writing Hood (since I am a writer) so I got this outfit for Halloween. It arrived on time, fit well (I am 5""8, 145 lbs & the small fit perfectly), & looked great.  It says small is 6-8, and I also wear Banana Republic 6-8 sizes, as well as American Eagle the same. So it fit standard retailer sizes.

Unfortunately I forgot the hood at home, so I ended up looking like a truck-stop waitress. But heck, that is cute too.

I outfitted myself with a red headband, red heart necklace, white thigh-his with little red bows on them and white 4"" heels & danced the night away..."
"Perfect! So hard to find good shoes she can walk in for my 18 month old. She has small feet so still in a size 4. The leather on top of the shoe is soft and flexible. The bottom rubber sole isn't too heavy but its nice, thick and sturdy. Perfect fit and oh so cute!!"
All around great briefs.
"Always know when the Lee label is on something  it represents quality. I always  check  out  the reviews  before ordering  and I'm  glad I  did. I usually  order a size 12 but went up a size  to 14 to take in a small amount of shrinking  after washing others mentioned . Glad I  did!  The skirt is a nice classic  design and will be great to wear for casual errands etc. I would  have  given  it 5 stars,  but it  needs ironing when it comes out of the  dryer - and believe me I  get things  out fast so I  don't  have to iron!"
"Comfy, true to size and stylish! I love these with jeans"
Love them.  Not excited that they are slightly see thru but a long sweater fixes that problem. Comfy warm material.  Quick delivery!  Satisfied. Thanks :)
This is a lovely purse and I like it so much; have gotten many comments on it!
I purchased one for my daughter and loved it so much that I ordered one for my self. LOVE IT!
"You get what you pay for. It is okay, though, and my son loves it. The pocket ripped a little, and I fixed it before it got too bad. But he wears it every day, so it was worth it. I bought a size 'large' for him, and he normally wears adult medium in men's clothes. I'm really glad I read the other reviews and bought one size larger.
If I had a choice, I would buy it again.

UPDATE: The zipper pull fell off and he's very disappointed. :/ I tried buying replacement zipper pulls but they didn't work right. I might try another one I found in a catalog."
They're Levis'.
I thought it would be too small for my sister-in-law but it wasn't.  True to size
Love the socks. I wear flip flops year round. Not to mention they are a good conversation item.
My wife loved the fit and the comfort. She said that a are perfect for work. She is on her feet 8 hours a day in a retail store. She highly recommend this product.
"Arrived as expected, they are nice for the price, would order again"
Just as pictured.  Snapped easily onto my Pandora bracelet.  Great price.  Fast shipping.
"I have a hard time finding jeans that fit (and compliment) my middle aged body, and I'm so glad I tried these.  I love that the waist comes up to my natural waistline, and I love the skinny legs on these!  They make my rear end look good (well, as good as 4 kids and 53 years can look), and for once I have pant legs that fit and flatter my thinner hips and legs.  These also fit true to size on me, and have just enough stretch in them to still be comfortable after Thanksgiving dinner. I'm 5-4 and the medium length was perfect.  These aren't ""old lady"" jeans but they're also not something my college-age daughter would like.

There's no muffin top showing, no bulges or gaps at the waist or thighs, and really I don't think I've found jeans that fit me this well since I was in my 20s.  I wish they came in more colors (other than various shades of blue) because I'd buy one of each!

If you're a more curvy woman, try the 529.  I ordered (and returned) a pair of those - if you have a smaller waist and some hips, those are the ones for you."
LOVE this garment! excellent service!!
This is one of the best items I have ever purchased.  Great Quality!
"This jacket is nice, love the color and fit. I'm 5'4 and 175lbs and the large size fits me perfectly (even the thumb holes hit at the right length). It keeps me warm without being too warm. Very comfortable."
Retro style with modern flair. These have been my all-time favorite shoes. I own six pair in different colors. I wish they were still available to purchase.
Pretty but very small and only one size is offered.
"Perfect for summer! Fit both my 8 and 6 year old like a breeze. This is a light cover up, and better suited for summer than fall."
They are (one size) but didn't stretch enough for me so I had to give them to one of my daughters.
Super fast shipping and the quality of the product was great. Nice bright colors. I got it for a 2 year old so he could grow into it.
"Simply lovely well made. The skulls are defined beautifully. They remind me of Cinco de Mayo. Nice length and width. The background is a soft beige bordering on a light caf. Nicely wrapped and folded. Very pleased, I live in the northeast,cold,windy. This scarf meets my needs, can be used any way you want. ROCKERS DELIGHT ENJOY"
Received so many compliments. Very comfortable- I wore them the entire day without any discomfort.. Runs a little small. Go up a half size.

It has a nice real leather band and a classy looking face. I would not have guessed it costs under $30 if I did not see the listing price. The band maximum width 8.25"" (from the clasp to the last hole), if needed additional holes could be made to make it as wide as 8.5"".  The watch's face is 40mm (1.57"") wide and the watch is 7.5 mm (0.30"") thick.

The watch shows just hours, minutes and seconds. It shows no date.

Amazon description states that it is water resistant, but the watch case has no markings that it is water resistant.

This watch is provided by Besseron for evaluation and review. Overall, this is a very basic watch with an attractive face and band.

Ali Julia review"
"I love these little coin purses! I bought one for my best friend also, she loves hers too!! My wallet coin holder wasn't big enough. I was always having to dig out change. This is nice a deep."
"I'm an average height woman who is fairly trim and, fully extended, the straps on this ""kids'"" backpack makes it ideal for carrying my iPad (original model iPad 1).  If you have a thin silicone skin, it should be fine, too, but any thicker case such as a leather folio style will not fit.  I could also squeeze in my Targus bluetooth keyboard (model AKB32US), leaving the front outside pocket for housekeys, lipstick, etc.  Note, though, that there is no padding, so if you intend to use this for your iPad, carry it carefully.  It also would be the cutest little thing for children to carry a few small items and maybe a 5 x 7 book or two or possibly 8 x 10 (but no large textbooks).  The zipper allows for a fairly wide opening, making it easy to reach items inside the backpack."
This costume is a must have for any perent with a baby... so cute and the material is not bad.
Very nice dress looks exactly like the picture. I just may have gotten a size too small? It fits nicely everywhere but around my shoulders. Overall I do like this dress and the quality is very nice compared to most laced dresses.
Love this hat. Fit as expected. Got for my son and he looks super fly lol.
"Wore it over a white tank. Color bleed onto the tank but washed out in the laundry.
Great fit, soft fabric, and a nice color."
They look good .THANKS
"These earrings are beautiful much nicer  than pictured.  They are a little to long for me, but my Granddaughter will love them."
Teenager loves these. Not see through. Hold up well. Tons of compliments.
"Fit well and dry quickly. The length is short, as expected, but not too short. I'm 5 ft 5 in. tall and they fit a bit above the knee. Overall great shorts."
"This is a nice bra and it definitely adds some push up. It stays up well without the straps. The only small problem I had is that the band around is pretty tight. I'll take it off after a couple hours and have marks from where it was sitting. But once I wear it a little more, it'll probably stretch out some so I'm fine with that."
"Very pretty, still in one piece!"
Love love love this jumper!!! Super cute and the way more comfy than ever expected!
"I can fit my key fob, all my credit cards, a chap stick, money, receipts, and cell phone so nicely in this soft leather wallet - LOVE IT!"
"Love this boots, very comfortable and keep you warm during those cold days of winter."
Get compliments every single time I wear it.
"Very good running shoe, it fullfill my expectations."
"Love, love, love these shoes...the colors are awesome and the look is great.  They are super comfortable and fit great.  I wear an eight, bought an eight and perfect!!  They are a little wide but that is exactly what I need cause I have a bit of a wide foot...
Again....LOVE THESE SHOES!"
"Like all Red Wing ""Heritage"" boots I've seen and owned, the construction and quality are top-notch. Wearing Red Wings makes me not want to bother with any other boots anymore."
"Love how this looked! A little cheaply made, but it was cute!"
"Boots were a little stiff at first, but after wearing for about a week they broke in nicely. I work in very hazardous work area with extreme chemicals. These boots are now over a year & a half old and still going strong! Great workmanship & materials! I would definitely recommend these and may be buying another pair if this pair ever wears out."
"This dress was perfect for my event! I am 34 with three kids, and was looking for an elegant gown to wear to a ball. This dress made me feel great without being overly sexy or exposed. I received so many compliments all night, and no one could believe it was a $40 Amazon dress! I used the size chart pictured and ordered accordingly, and the fit was perfect. I used a hand-held steamer to get the wrinkles out of the skirt. Amazon dress for the win!"
I read the reviews and am very small but wanted this to not only fit but wanted it long like on the model so I ordered a large and it's perfect. The sleeves are long and it goes almost to my knees. I've got long legs so I love the way it's still form fitting and it's long. Don't be afraid to order a couple sizes up cuz it hugs the body so it's more about length. Will recommend this to friends and family.
"Michael Kors has beautiful products and I am a huge fan! I am constantly getting compliments whenever I wear this watch.  It is a big watch.  The removable links are helpful.  I can take out one of the links and it fits perfect, but I like loose watches so I keep all 3 links in.  Be careful when removing the links, they will fall off.  I have lost a link a couple of times, but luckily I have been able it find it every time."
Works in all weather 40 degrees or above.
"My son's favorite outfit. He wears this every time I wash it while ignoring most every other thing. The quality was very good on it, no threads coming lose and no color fading."
Great fit but a little thin. Not see through.
"Great dress...unreal value for price. I got the red in medium. I'm 5'6 and 148 lb's.  Fit well, got tons of compliments.  Sexy, but still a classic sophisticated look. Can't go wrong."
High quality item and fast delivery
"They're a lot stiffer than I have experienced with other DocMartens.  I was a little unhappy with that, but with some wear I'm sure they'll be great."
This wallet is one of my favorite things.  Even though I don't usually have a lot of money in it.... every time I take it out it makes me smile.  It's that nice.  There is no better wallet for ANY price.  I love the Tobacco Brown color.... just gets better with age.
Nice material and nice color.
Very elegant received many complements bangle not tight very comfortable

It is really quality-made and it looks so dainty and perfect. The rose gold is a great compliment to warm skin tones and is great at add warmth to cooler skin tones. I wear a size 7 ring and so that's what I ordered. The fit is perfect. It's not too snug at all it, it hugs my ring finger on my left hand. The little Cubic Zirconia sparkle better than any I've ever seen.

Which is why I made a short video because really anything I say about this ring I want to prove :) I really do love it and I think it adds so much beauty to anything I'm wearing. I personally am preferring the rose gold color to my silver wedding set.

The box it comes in isn't what I would expect from a really high-end looking ring like this. It's just an orange, light material, gift box with a pattern of white triangles and the company name on it. If I were going to give this as a gift, I honestly might choose a fancier looking box because the box doesn't give their jewelry the credit it deserves. I mean it's not a bad box at all and I certainly don't purchase jewelry for the gift box, but it could be more.

Check out the video and watch this ring sparkle. I fell in love when I did!!

I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
Very cute and comfortable. I wore them all day and my feet didn't hurt.
"Onex shoes have padding inside the lining and the toe divider is encased in a clear plastic tube, adding to the comfort. The color turquoise is beautiful and has quality detailed embellishments. Purchase a size larger than your regular size."
"I ordered these Birkenstock Unisex Arizona Sandals for my husband's upcoming birthday. The pair that he has had for the last 20+ years were finally wearing out in the heel.
I used the information from tne soles of the previous shoes to reorder, and they are a perfect fit! He loves them!"
"This garment fits perfectly, is very light weight yet warm, and is really soft so it  feels like I am not wearing it."
"My husband did have to re-attach some of the hardware, but that was no biggie.  I lovely piece of furniture. Amazon is my go to place!  I don't have to fight the crowds and I just let my fingers do the walking."
"I love this gemstone, have received many compliments on it. Maggie"
I love Birkenstocks and have worn them for years.  I ordered a size 40 (9) as usual.  In the size 40 box was a size 36 so they were returned and of course there were no more size 40 left to purchase.
"These shoes are cool. They are comfortable, but not really for walking 18 holes. They don't have enough support. If you are in a cart most of the time grab these. If you are buying  a second or back up pair, grab these. Just don't make them your primary walking golf show."
"This was a Christmas gift to my boyfriend. It's a nice wallet, and he appears to be liking it. Good price and good quality."
Better than expected. Pleasantly surprised.
This skirt is Awsome!!! It arrived real quick too. I am 5'7 155 lbs and this skirt fits like i a glove and material very nice and  too. Colors are nice too. BUT Very true to size!! I ordered L-XL.BUT IT IS A LITTLE SHORT ON ME BY I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH IT. AND IF IT IS TO SHORT YOU CAN ALWAYS WEAR WHITE LEGGINGS OR RED WHAT EVER YOU PERFER!!
"Excellent piece.

* Very elegant and sturdy design
* I love the fact that is not shinny, but a matte finish
* I like the color-line around it; It adds a very nice touch
* Cushions are also well made and soft, but do keep their shape

The only concern I must express is that while all cushions are armed with watches, there seems to be a enought room/space for the watches to tilt to sides.  But this could be one's personal preference as some may find it a plus when pullling one the watch to wear.

I certainly recommend it and would buy again both as gift and personal."
Wonderful beach shirt.
