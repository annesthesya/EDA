negative,2.0,"I've been playing Santa for 25 years ... I have authentic high-quality Santa boots and a very high-end costume, except for the belt.  I never got around to replacing that cheap belt.  So this year I thought I'd make the shift. This belt has rave reviews on Amazon and runs about half the price of the leather Santa belts on Amazon, so I thought I'd gamble.  I'm kinda sorry I did.  The only thing that is quality about this belt is the buckle.  It is VERY nice.  But the black Naugahyde is only about 15 - 20% thicker than the cheap belt I had, and frankly, looks about the same.  The rivets in the holes are the exact same cheap metal as on my cheap costume belt.  The buckle is great. The belt?  Meh.  So yes, the buckle is VERY nice, but this belt is not worth the price asked.  I wished I spent the extra money to get a nice leather Santa belt.

By the way, if this is all your budget allows, know that the belt runs pretty large.  If you even think you might need the smaller one, GET THE SMALLER ONE.",It's nice. But the Naugahyde is not as thick as one might hope for
negative,1.0,"I bought two of these because one had a better shipping schedule. The second pair are great. The first pair that took the longest to arrive broke beyond repair the very first time I wore them. I took a picture, but don't see an upload option on mobile. The clasp on the right shoe tore completely away as I was walking.
It's a shame. The other pair are great. Glad I still have those.",Inconsistent product.
negative,1.0,"Came out of the box with scratches on one lense. I know they are inexpensive, but they're unusable with a big scratch... That kind of defeats the mirrored lens effect.",Scratched
negative,2.0,"Okay, this is kind of hard to explain. I really liked the skirt, but I do not know if it is my body type or just how to skirt was constructed. Initially, I ordered a size medium, which was huge, so I returned it and ordered a small. I should also mention that I am usually a small to medium in skirts so I was sure that the small would be fine. When I tried on the small, the waist was still pretty large but I thought that I could work with it. Then, I tried it on with a shirt tucked in, and it just looked so strange. The waist was too large, but then the section that falls on the hips is tighter than the waist. This is clearly not a free hip skirt and doesn't really give you the ""circle skirt"" effect that vintage style skirts usually do. This might be a body type issue, but I don't know.",I really liked the skirt
negative,2.0,"The illustrations aren't even close.  I didn't care about which colors I received but I wanted the bright and vibrant colors on the picture.

negative,2.0,"I ordered the same watch in silver and loved it, so I decided to order the rose gold too.  After removing a couple links to make it fit, I tried the watch on and realized it didn't work.  I set it and the second hand started ticking, but only lasted a few seconds, got stuck, and stopped moving.  It was cheap enough I didn't bother sending it back, but instead used the parts to fix my first watch when the pin broke.",mine didn't work

negative,2.0,"I usually skeptical of ordering rings online, this time my skepticism was well deserved! I ordered this to replace the one I lost, in like 48 hours, my finger turned green.

negative,1.0,Fits as expected. Material is as expected. Image was as expected initially. Horrible fading after first wash. Save your money on this one. I had washed this shirt for the first time along with 4 other Ironman shirts I had just purchased and this was the only one that had any fading. I can understand a little fading but the image was nearly none sustain after the very first wash. Unacceptable.,Horribly faded after first wash!
negative,1.0,"Picture shows Blonde Wig clearly modeled after Donald Trump. Upon looking back at the description, I finally noticed it says 'brown' for the color. However, the wig is actually a deep red color, so neither the image not the color description are accurate. False advertising, very disappointed.",False advertising
negative,2.0,"Not big enough when fully opened to put paper bills in. I thought by the dimensions and the pictures, once opened,  I could put my paper money in and not have to fold it over so I had to send this back.  I wanted this for a small cross body bag but it didn't work out for me. I don't need all the plastic slots for cards, I just need a few slots and a place to properly fit paper money.",Doesn't fit my paper money even when opened fully
negative,1.0,"I guess I cannot be too surprised at the poor quality of these, based on the price. Put one of them on and it broke immediately.

negative,2.0,not great small and uncomfortable,Two Stars
negative,2.0,"I was a little disappointed with this shirt. The picture shown is clearly of a size Small shirt. I bought size XXXL as it was for a larger person but the santa beard and belt graphic on the front was the same size as what I assume they print on size S. So it was just a small little graphic on the front of this very large shirt, which looked stupid, especially since there's a belt on there which ended up just being a buckle and a tiny piece of the belt strap on either side of it and then it ends abruptly. The shirt itself was thick, heavy cotton - no issues there. But if you're buying a larger size, be aware of the tiny graphic issue..",Size XXXL was not as depicted in the picture

negative,1.0,"I have these exact same shoes in the same size (8), and the two pairs could not fit more differently. The material even feels different. My old pair, which I love, fit perfectly and are very soft. (I bought them at Big 5 Sporting Goods.) The new pair is almost an inch shorter and are made of much a harder material, almost a hard plastic. They both say China on the bottom. So either Crocs is having trouble with consistency (which I've read from several reviews) OR this new pair is a knockoff. Either way, I'm super bummed because I was really hoping to have a backup of my favorite summer sandals.",Not the same shoe as before

negative,1.0,"I normally love Diesel shoes, but this is the worst pair I've owned. The tongue on the left shoe came loose after about a week, and I suspect that it was a manufacturer's defect where the stitches were not properly added. I could probably have them repaired, but what a pain! I should note that I didn't purchase them from Amazon, I got them at The Buckle and had to twist their arm to get a refund.",Bad experience with Diesel.
negative,1.0,"Beautiful, but several sizes too small.",One Star
negative,1.0,"I'm not pleased with this skirt at all. It fits my daughter a full size too big, and the waist is especially huge. There are adjustable tabs inside, but they are located in the back. So once tightened, it makes the back of the skirt look strange. Only the pleats and decorative tabs on the front make it similar to the classic French Toast skirts. Everything is is way off.",Not like other French Toast skirts. Sending back.

I usually buy Front-Close Unlined bras from Soma.com, but they have discontinued this particular bra & I was looking for a replacement.  I hate padded bras!  I usually wear a 40D.  Other reviewers said that the band was tight, so I ordered a 42D.  The Band fit perfectly, but the D cups pooched out at the sides & I was actually swimming in this bra.  I returned it & have ordered a 42C.  We'll see how that works.

I ordered the 2nd bra in a 42C and the bra had the cups sewn in pointing off in weird directions.  This is the last time I'll order from Lilyette.  The bras are very inconsistent and not worth the trouble of reordering & returning them over and over again.",Nothing Special

negative,1.0,"okay so, this item is incredibly hard to figure out. Took me about two tries to put it on as the picture is shown here. And there is no, no way this fits me. The straps on the lower half are way too small even with the straps adjusted to the longest length. I'm not a big girl, I'm 37""b, 29w, and 36h and this suit cuts into my body making me look like some sort of abstract statue made out of playdough. If that wasn't bad enough, the stitching is just absolutely atrocious. The bows are all frayed and it's not nearly as sexy in person in my personal opinion. The garter straps do not look like the picture.

The only thing good about it is the stockings and that it shipped fast. I will not be using this item, I can't imagine any woman of average size fitting into it either. Please don't bother getting this item! I have ordered other G world things and have liked it but, trust me this is a waste of time if you're not an 24"" hip 0_o","Whoa, NOT SO SEXY."

It is like the material used to make Solo disposable plastic cups. The plan was to have my son pose with disc for a cool picture, but I was so upset I did it even let him see it. I planned on returning them but the company does not offer free returns and the shipping cost would more than likely cost more than the products.

negative,1.0,"Seriously, this purchase is the final chance I am giving to a company which, once upon a time, made superb footwear.

I purchased three pairs of 1460s (which were then made in England) in my late teens and early twenties, all of which I beat the hell out of. One pair lasted me two years as a laborer for a plumbing outfit I... labored for. Not bad considering they aren't a true work boot. One pair lasted me five, FIVE, years in the food service industry. That's five years of walking miles and miles a day for fifty to sixty hours a week. Astonishing. The last pair, which were my casual go-to in the beginning of their life, finally gave up the ghost two years back after long ago being relegated to the miscellaneous handy man/painting/I-don't-care-what-happens-to-these spot. They were at least eight years old. Wow.

After Dr. Martens ceased large scale production in England, I have purchased three pairs, these Harlows being number three. The first pair took almost a month to break in, but once they were, they were really comfortable. Until the sole split down the middle after only having them for four months. Hmmm... Well, I chalked it up to a fluke, and order another pair shortly thereafter. This pair was sub-Walmart GARBAGE. The ""leather"" started cracking after five or six weeks of wear, and...whatever, they were trash. I held off for a few years and then I spied these while browsing. Price was okay, they looked like what I wanted, and here we are, about a month in. First impressions were good - the leather seemed a good deal thicker than the last two East Asian pairs I got, so I took no chances and Lexoled the bejesus out of them. After many doses of a good conditioner, they got ultra supple, and really formed to my foot, and, after the addition of an actual insole, they were like walking on air . They reminded me of the old pairs I had fifteen years ago. And they have a kinda pseudo-flannel lining which adds an extra bit of warmth, which is nice to have in Wisconsin. The stitching is sound, the soles seem solid yet flexible, the eyelets don't pop off while you're walking - they are a complete one-eighty from the last two pairs. If all goes well, I may look into buying another pair down the road. If not, sadly, then I'm done with a company which I once loved; a company that used to make a quality product.

My only twp gripes are a) the laces are a joke, so you best buy a decent pair to replace the ones that will break almost immediately, and b) for $130 list, I expect an insole. Not a super-dee-duper space age technology orthopedic wundersole, but something. ANYTHING. C'mon.

All in all, I'm very happy with them and I hope to remain so.

Edit: 12.20.14

Guys, you blew it.

After not even two months of casual, almost exclusively indoor wear, the stitching is coming undone at the heel and where the vamp meets the upper (which boggles my mind because it is triple-stitched - how is that even possible?). And I babied these things, man. They were kept clean, conditioned and waterproofed. I even used shoes trees in them several times a week. The only reason for two stars is that they are very comfortable, but that's not gonna matter once the stitching deteriorates, is it?

Well, I'll still wear them until the end, whenever that may be, but never again will I purchase another Dr. Martens product. I should've spent the extra thirty bucks and got that pair of Chippewas I was eyeing.

See ya, Doc.","Last chance for you, Doctor Marten."

I'm sure it's an accurate and reliable timepiece as all Seikos tend to be, but I just had to send mine back.  Really disappointing, because I have been looking for a nice BLACK metal watch for under $200 for a long time now, and jumped at the Kinetic movement (no batteries!) and Seiko reliability.

Unfortunately, I didn't realize just how distractingly and distressingly RED the rotating bezel is, and also as another reviewer pointed out, there is a fundamentally WEIRD or OUT OF WACK sense of scale between the overall huge size of the watch case and the tiny, almost dainty, size of the actual dial and hands.  In a nutshell, when worn on my wrist it looks like two watches in one: a huge honkin' clunky men's diving watch, with a dainty women's watch inside of it.

Build quality is excellent, and I liked the weight and heft of this watch.  But sorry, it's just butt FUGLY, if you ask me.

negative,1.0,"I should of sized down, these shoes run large. On top of that the button isn't sewed on. It's placed in a hole in a shoe with a fastener type of medal, like the old time paper metal clips you would open and close.

negative,2.0,"I bought these because they were recommended, on another website, for people with plantar fasciitis.  They do have decent (not great) arch support, but clogs are not good for this because you have to scrunch your toes to keep them on when you walk.  Also, the little flap that sticks up at the heel ends up under your heel, causing pain.  The flap should either go away or be made higher.  I always wear a size 38 (size 8 U.S.), but I heard they run small and got a 39.  They were tight.  On the positive side, the fabric is very nice and warm, and the sole is nice for hanging out in the house.  I am having a lot of trouble finding well designed house slippers.",Look good but are uncomfortable
negative,2.0,"Firstly these boots are clearly the high quality you would expect from UGG. The leather and craftsmanship is sublime and they look very classy and stylish, timeless Chelsea boots here for sure. The bottom has a great grip tread but somehow manages to look steam line and not clunky in the slightest. For looks and craftsmanship these are five star all the way.
However.....a number of points cause me to sadly have to return these
1. Like a few other reviewers mention, they are strangely narrow in the heel which makes them quite a feat to just get on for that reason alone, yet for myself anyways this wasn't a painful issue, slipping them on will never be easy
2. I have regular width feet, bordering on narrow yet these are painfully narrow and scrunch your toe bones up so your feet click and crunch when you walk. One foot was worse than the other.
3. Sizing up is not a possibility realistically. Yes, Sizing up will give a little extra room at the length but they are not going to get wider and these are so narrow that wearing even the thinnest socks is impossible. I fear the extra length will just make them even more uncomfortable since now they are too tight width wise and they will slip and rub at the heel. Accounting for extra room by wearing thicker socks just can't happen with these

I would say if you have very narrow feet then these will work wonderfully for you.
I would say if your a sadist and are prepared to go through the torture of wearing them long enough to stretch the leather our enough to be comfortable then go for it.
Real shame, cause these are gorgeous on",Painfully beautiful

negative,1.0,"I'm very disappointed and will be returning the shirt. The transfer is not whole it has skips and missing places. This happens when transfer is not hot enough so when transfer paper is removed some of the color remains on the paper. This is so clearly not done correctly I would have to call it a second. The shirt itself is heavy cotton and looks to be good quality. I also got a ""First Mate"" shirt by same company that has the exact same problem.

negative,1.0,"This was one of my daughters birthday presents and she was very happy. She wore it each day but always taking it off for showers, pool and at night to sleep.

I knew it wouldn't be an expensive piece of jewelry or last forever however I did think it would last at least a few months.",Not what I thought..
negative,1.0,I can't testify as to the durability of these boots as I have to return them. I wear a size 10.5 in athletic shoes and most boots I wear are around 8.-9.5.  I ordered these in both a 10 and a 10.5 and it's as if the length of the boot didn't change at all.  The width of the heel changed which is bad for me because I have narrow heels.  But as of now my big toe touches the edge in BOTH sizes. No point in ordering a size 11 as my heel would flop around in the back. Otherwise they seemed like they would have been good boots.,Great if you're missing your big Toe
negative,1.0,"The fabric is nice, it didn't roll up on me - however I'm not the best judge of this considering I wore it only once.  The seam of the shirt of the neckline is finished with a thin layer of fabric - the piping? if you will, and it ripped right off and you could see it rising above the neckline of my shirt.  Also not happy because I went by the size guide and at the end of the night I had tender sore spots around the front of my armpits/upper boobie area from my skin rubbing along the material.  The arm holes go a little too far back so it became really irritating.

You might have better luck with this since it was relatively slimming on the stomach but if you're like me, 5'7 wearing a size Large, it might not work out.

Also disappointed that I e-mailed the company for an exchange and they never got back to me.",Dissapointed.

negative,1.0,"Original review :  I'm giving these leggings four stars because according to the size chart, I was supposed to purchase a large which I did. However, the large did not fit as snug as leggings are supposed to fit. The waist and leg area both were loose. I took the tag off and washed and dried them so I cannot return but I do feel as though I lost 36 dollars because I don't feel comfortable wearing loose fitting leggings with the outfits I had planned to wear these HUE leggings with. I have purchased HUE curvy denim leggings in large and they should be arriving today... I'm hoping the elasticity in those are a little less stretchy so maybe the large will fit and I won't have to go through the hassle of returning the ""jeggings"". I believe that if there leggings were a little tighter I would really love them.

After wearing leggings for a few weeks (not consistently) : okay this review started with four stars because the item was not exactly true to size and pretty expensive to me. Also the leggings are see through. Now I have to rate them 1 star because the stitching on the leggings are all starting to come apart and I can't even wear them anymore.

negative,1.0,"Updated review, 11/23/14:
------------
after having these shoes for less than a year, and wearing them casually and lightly for parts of winter, spring and now the fall of 2014, I'm sorely disappointed in their quality.  The shoes are already showing grossly excessive deterioration of the tread on both shoes, having lost numerous lugs on the rear third of both shoes.

Subsequent to purchasing, I found out that these shoes are made by Wolverine, the very same company that bought what was once a great brand of shoes in Merrell, and ruined them.  I've had three pairs of Merrell Chameleon Prime Stretch shoes in the last two months that have had such poor quality soles/treads that have become unglued and/or lost lugs in less than three weeks wearing, that I will never buy another Wolverine family product again.

I think the US Federal Government needs to prosecute this company for putting out shoddy products and charging top dollar for products that fail.  With the technology that exists today, there's not excuse for shoes that are worn lightly, in less than one year's time, losing chunks of the tread.  I've had shoes that have lasted me 5+ years that have never lost tread like Wolverine products do.

---------------------------------------------------------------
I find the Shelk to be a great all-around comfortable shoe that while running a half to full-size larger than other shoes, is excellent for the money and a far better value than its cousins in the Merrell line.  So far the shoe is proving durable in the two months I have owned it and hope it stays that way.  I might well buy 2-3 pairs for saving, in case they stop making it.","Very comfortable shoe, terrible quality and durability - don't buy!!"

i decided this week to try the black leather version hoping this would turn out different but instead it was worse. this time one boot was smooth leather, the other boot had the pattern you see in the photo. PLUS the smooth boot had a pointed round toe, while the other boot had a big huge full round toe on it, like twice as big.

back for refund, but what a hassle. i'd stay away from justin boots that are made in china, which means most if not all under $175 or so. if made to design, these would be wonderful boots, but because of rotten/NO quality control you get things like 2 different style boots when you order these (both idiotically marked with the same style number) or other weird things like toe stitched insignia looking like a postage stamp put on the wrong way.",THE ABSOLUTE WORST BECAUSE OF HORRIBLE CHINESE QUALITY CONTROL...MEANING NONE!!!!

As you can see from the pictures, these have holes within the first year.  I live in Philadelphia and we've had a relatively dry year until this week, so I've only worn these 20ish times.  Almost immediately after stepping outside this morning, I noticed my foot getting wet and the obvious hole in the side of my boot.  My fuzzy sock and tights were soaked by the time I got to work.

Very unhappy as I have a very difficult time finding rainboots that fit my calf and wide foot and from a comfort standpoint these weren't bad, but they are obviously lacking in quality.

****Original Review****

I measured my foot and calf prior to ordering, as I have wide feet and large calves.
My foot is 9"" long and wide, and my calves are 16.2"".
I ordered an 8 in the black without a buckle (Idk if that makes a difference), which is actually 9.6"".  They fit, lengthwise I have a thumb which is about 0.5"".  I could have comfortably gone with a 7.5, however, I am now reluctant to return, as width wise, they seem to just fit and the size chart does not provide width.  I actually would probably prefer a size down, as they are kind of heavy, but I don't want to risk it.  They fit my calf well, I can stick my hand down the side while I'm in.",Holes within a year

I purchased these shoes from a local vendor.  They are exceedingly comfortable for both casual and exercise wear. They offer great support, and are the first exercise shoes I've purchased in years that don't leave blisters on my feet.  I took them to work to wear for lunch time walks, and around the same time began to notice a smell that made me think someone had discarded rotten food in the area.  Then I thought one of my co-workers must have developed horrible body odor.  After a week or so, I took a trip wearing the shoes during my flight.  The smell followed, so of course I thought I had developed body odor!  But, after unpacking and leaving the shoes in the hotel closet for a couple days, the closet began to take on the same odor.  I was able to track the smell back to the soles (not the insoles) of these shoes.  The smell is a horrible gassy/chemical smell.  I found the same complaint not only with other NB models, but other manufacturer's shoes.  Other reviews mentioned it might be due to the shoes getting wet, or the adhesive, and/or a certain type of foam used.  In any case, they smell too bad to keep in the house.  So, I keep them on the patio, and put them on only when walking outdoors.  They're too comfortable to toss, or they would be gone.  Unfortunately, it seems as if the smell didn't fully develop until I'd owned the shoes for several weeks.

And no, it's not my feet causing the shoes to smell.  And yes, I actually made my spouse to a sniff test, comparing my old, well-worn sneakers to these.  It's the new shoes.","Comfortable, but REEK!"

The pad seems to work reasonably well in the small of the back or across the back below the neck.  The control allows for a welcome range of temperature.  However, the location of the ""plug in"" for the electrical cord makes it cumbersome to use the pad.  A better design would be to have a cord come out of the pad for several inches before the electrical supply cord attached.  The only way I have been able to apply heat effectively to my shoulder with this pad has been to hold it into place with my opposite hand cupped to force it down onto the area.  The pad seems to be well made, and it heats effectively, but I would not recommend it for areas where the pad could not be fully extended flattened (and the plug-in would not interfere).",Not a good choice for shoulders

negative,2.0,"Bought two Playtex bras from this seller as replacement for a discontinued Playtex bra that I wore for years and years ( Playtex # 4138).

This bra (Playtex # 4913) I will be returning for an exchange to a different style because the quality of it is VERY poor, with lots of cheap plastic parts (strap loops and band hooks). It's unevenly sewn together and the seams are off, so there's no way it'll last for repeated washings and wear. But that's NOT a seller problem, that's a Playtex problem! It also fit weird, kind of baggy along the bottom of the cups next to the underwire, like I was wearing a sock instead of a bra. But that's likely a function of the cup style, which is two thin layers of fabric rather than thick molded cups, which I'm used to. As a size DD cup, fit and lift is critical to a comfortable and attractive fit. This won't work for me at all. Too bad because the color and style are very pretty on the hanger.

This seller was fairly quick in getting the items to me, and very helpful/responsive when there were weather related shipping delays. Would buy from them again.

negative,2.0,"I had these shoes bookmarked for two months before splurging, so I was disappointed to find that they didn't meet my expectations on several fronts.

1. proportion - there's something wrong with the scale of these shoes from a design standpoint. They're just bigger and clunkier than any photo reveals. This is magnified once they're on the feet. I have a closet full of chunky shoes, but these just make me feel like a clown. Not funny.

2. fit - I have wide feet, but there was too much space on the sides for a secure fit; consequently, my ankles buckle constantly.

3. weight - for a ""foot friendly"" shoe, these are far too heavy to be of any significant benefit.

4. hard to put on, take off - admittedly, I'm impatient when it comes to donning shoes. I want to be able to slip them on, buckle and go. But these require me to sit and wiggle my feet into what is actually a pretty narrow passage way more reminiscent of a boot than a sandal.

In sum, these shoes are an example of something that looks better on the rack than on the feet. I can't recommend them; I can't even manage to resell them, sigh.",So disappointed

They are now a piece of junk after normal wear for two winters (to and from work in the vehicle, but no hard work in them) because the snaps and zippers are falling apart.  I wish these were better quality because then we would be repeat customers.  Looking for a new brand now.  This has sullied the name of the Dickies brand for us.

Then we found out that Dickies would replace them!  This made us so happy... at first.  But after spending two whole months of dealing with Dickies customer service, they ""lost"" the record of our first two phone calls with them despite the girl remembering my DH, kept saying changing what they would offer to replace the overalls with, and finally (4th call) ended up offering to replace them with an inferior Walls brand (the zippers on the legs do not come up past the knee).  Hubby asked if they would at least throw in a free cap or shirt, and they are sending two cheap knit tomboggans with the Dickies logo.  Sorry, but we won't be advertising such bad service!!!  NO MORE DICKIES purchases for us!!!

Previous review when they were new..."" My husband loves these.  He formerly owned a pair of the regular insulated bib overalls by Dickies.  The difference in these are that the leg zippers begin higher at the hip so that he can zip down to reach into his jeans pockets.  He says they feel wonderful.

They are also very comfortable but not designed for a narrow foot.  I had the top as tight as it would go, and it fit, but this did not allow for the leather inevitably stretching with wear.  I had to anticipate that in the near future, they would feel loose.  The back strap was the real problem.  It is made to look like a buckle, but it is actually velcro.  When I tighten it as much as my narrow foot requires, there is not enough velcro-on-velcro to hold it together and the strap kept coming undone.  Could I add more velcro?

negative,1.0,"Ariat makes great stuff. Ask any equestrian, particularly English riders, and theyll tell you they make a good, if expensive, boot.

These are (mostly) no exception... Quality, supple leather. Great style and details. Robust construction. Really a near perfect boot.

Except for one huge thing: the sizing. I need the pair of boots by the day of this review so im not going to keep guessing on the sizing and return these for a different size.

I really feel like the dimensions were put together by drunk cobblers. Seriously. Its terrible.

I'm a size 10.5-11. These in size 10wide were horrendously too big. Like amusingly so. So I tried again and re-ordered in 9.5m. They manage to be both slightly too large, and slightly too small in several places. And not quite in the normal just need to be worn in spots. I have owned all manner of boots. I have purchased riding boots from Ariat for many friends. I have never seen anything like the sizing of this boot.

So as others have suggested, order one full size smaller. And the only thing i can think, is that because of the smaller size, you may need to get it wide too. I really cant tell how easily mine are going to break in. Its loose in the heal (more than normal) but tight in the ball and top. And the calves are some of the largest and loosest ive ever seen on a boot. (normal for more suede type tops but this is crazy large, imo.) They manage to be a little too tight to put on too. Maybe this is on purpose because the floppy calf won't keep it on?

I'm going to oil and maybe even warm these up later to try to get a good fit. I've had them for 6 hours so far... Either way, for these prices, they really ought to have the sizing figured out. This is absurd. While im a huge fan of Amazon, this is one item you're better off buying at a boot shop so you can get the size figured out.

And the reason these get 1 from me is because ultimately, not matter how great a boot, if your boot doesnt fit right, and in this case im defining that as within the universally agreed upon standards in the US since Ariat is a US company, its a terribly boot for the consumer.",Tough to rate
negative,2.0,"Well, I waited a couple of weeks in order to give a more accurate review.  Let me first say that I have always been a big fan of New Balance shoes.  Is just about the only brand along with the Asics that I prefer.  Having said this, I have to rethink about New Balance and what is happening with their shoes.  I have been extremely disappointed with the last two pairs (not even the same style) that I have purchased.  I have always spoke highly and recommended New Balance shoes.  After this pair I will not be so quick to make this recommendation. The shoe runs wide (I did not purchase the wide variety either), has not heel support although it claims to do so.  I have a more narrow foot and I run 3.5 miles 4 to 5 times per week.  This shoe although it claims its for running has absolutely no foot support.  It runs wide and that in itself is another problem for me when running, I like a snug supportive fit.  If I would have kept the box I would have requested a return on it.

negative,1.0,"I thought these looked good at first, or at least, on Amazon's website that is - prior to having purchased them. However, when they arrived, I had a much different opinion of them. They were so skinny - starting from the mid-sole to the end of the toe box, that they could've easily been mistaken for cowboy boots. If that's the fashion that you're looking for, then you'll probably like them; that is, if you can bear having to stand in them for 10 minutes or so, or if you are able to walk down a city block without stumbling or looking like you're inebriated as hell. I most certainly couldn't so I returned them.

I contacted Amazon and was told the return period was over, however they were willing to send a return label and refund my money. This is actually what I would expect so I am happy to report it as my experience. My one complaint, though, is that I don't have a box large enough for the return and Amazon wasn't able to help with this.

I felt the shoes and couldn't find any rough spots or anything, and the shoes seemed to fit me properly, so I can only guess that it's because the stuff they are made out of is quite rigid, unlike normal Crocs.  I have a friend who bought the same shoes (because she thought mine were so cute) and hers didn't seem to do the same thing to her, so I'm not sure what happened with mine.

negative,1.0,"This is my first pair of Cole Haan shoes and probably the last. The shoes look great and feel moderately comfortable. My issue is that they are very slippery on wet floors.

I slipped in a stairwell and took a bad fall. Since then I have been very careful not to wear these shoes in wet conditions.

negative,2.0,"I purchased these tanks in a medium, specifying that being a 38-40"" chest,  and they fit accordingly.  I wear these as undershirts with knit polo and dress shirts. For this use, the fit of these undershirts would be perfect when worn as such. However, there is a problem with them that resulted in a 2 star rating and a refund request.  This issue has to do with the seam at the top of the shoulder.  It is poorly constructed and finished as I will attempt to capture in the photos.  Now I am no seamstress but I am competent with a sewing machine, and to me it appears that the seams in question are some kind of serger chain seam with looper threads that are not at all finished leaving those pieces sticking out.  This combined with the fact that the seam too tight leaving it puckered, you have an uneven seam that would be obvious under any shirt that lays flat over your shoulders appearing like little bumps just to the sides of your collarbones.  Perhaps I am being overly critical, but I expect an undershirt to be inconspicuous and these shirts certainly did not meet that criteria.

The width was the most disappointing part. I didn't have any trouble with the strap closest to the ankle , but when I tried to adjust the strap over my toes, I could barely make it! I managed to get the strap velcroed, but it was extremely tight and extremely uncomfortable!

negative,1.0,"Quality is terrible. When they arrived the first thing I had to do was trim loose threads from where they hemmed to keep the yarn unravelled.

They're too small, and I have thin arms. Unless you're really petite and small and almost certainly female, they won't even come close to fitting. They would work for a child or young teenager.

Nonetheless I plan to use them for the time being because I need something to keep my hands warm and my fingers free due to Raynaud's. If they don't fall apart like I expect and/or loosen up a bit to fit more comfortably from use, I might add a star. Maybe. In the meantime? I can't recommend these.

UPDATE:
3 months later, they're falling apart something fierce. There are two holes between two different pairs of fingers. There was three holes at one point, but I mended one of them. The hem is completely undone on one, and it's probably only a matter of time before that one straight up starts unravelling. I haven't even tried washing them yet because I'm afraid they'll fall apart completely (fortunately, they don't stink and aren't stained). I don't even use the gloves daily most of the time, only when it's cold.

I ordered five of them in different colors and had to return them all...but Amazon sent me an R/A and a UPS label and all I had to do was pack them up, slap the label on the box & take them to a UPS store without any hassle whatsoever. Wish I could say the same for 4 other shirts I ordered that I didn't realize would be shipped as ""Marketplace"" orders from 3 other locations and I had the same problem with those shirts (cut way too small). I had to return those at the post office and pay the return postage which was over 40.00 for 3 packages. I'm still trying to resolve this and Amazon is helping. In order to post this, I see that a star rating is required. Although the shirts looked fine, I don't feel that it's fair to give it a one star rating, so I'll just give it 2 stars and say ""I don't like it"" even though the shirts seemed well made and looked good. It's the fit that's the problem.",If you've got allot around the mid-section better order this shirt 2 or 3 sizes bigger.

negative,2.0,"This is NOT the same dress the model is wearing and you can see it in the customer pics as they all have the difference displayed. How is it different?
1 - There is a seam with what looks like a zipper on the back. This does not exist on the garment you receive. Instead the creases are down the sides where the color blocks are.
2 - The model displaying this has the top come in and hit the shoulder muscles. This is NOT the case with the dress received. Look at the 4 pics women who bought this dress and put it on posted. The top comes in no where near the shoulder muscles, aka midway between shoulder joint and neck. Instead it sits off the shoulder joint. It's blown out immensely.

Other Cons:
- The arms material is not stretchy. So if you have big arms, it's going to be tight and not give. if you have thin arms, they are going to swim in it. There is no give and no stretchiness. (Look at the customer pics again, you can see in one of them it's folding over on itself on the arms).
- This is a $15 dress with a $25 price tag
- The tag is on the side seam at the bottom, no clear indication which is front and which is back. Normally this isn't an issue, but since the top is so BLOWN OUT WIDE it's not an 'at a glance you can tell' type deal. Instead you gotta line it up and be like.. ok that's my front that's my back.

Pros:
- Delivers quickly.
- The sizes are actually American in size and it fits as expected per size ordered but not design wise.","No Ladies, sorry, it's really NOT that good"

negative,2.0,"So far so good!  Very comfortable and half the price of other sandals I have purchased.  I will see how they hold up and post an update later on...
Review Update:  I purchased these sandals the beginning of August and initially loved them.  Very comfortable and held up well to almost daily use.  After about 8 weeks of use all of a sudden one area on the side of the shoe where the side of your heal is just came out of the rubber insole.  The glue just gave it up.  I read some reviews of this happening and hoped it wouldn't be the case, but it was...  Very disappointing because of how comfortable they are.  Wont be purchasing again...

***Update 12/2/16*** After contacting both the seller and Amazon regarding the side of the shoe coming unglued from the sole, neither was able to do anything because it was past the 30 day return limit.  I decided to contact the manufacturer's customer service by email and explain to them what happened.  I received a reply within 48 apologizing for what happened and offering to replace the sandals at no cost to me.  They asked for a couple of pictures and gave me a few options on replacement sandals.  I chose a different style and color and they were shipped out today.  The whole process took about a week.

negative,2.0,"After reading the rave reviews of the ExOfficio Give-N-Go both here and on travel gear sites, I was underwhelmed by the product after trying it out for a few days.

The biggest issue with the Give-N-Go is that they do not really fit like boxer briefs should. I ordered both a large and a medium, and the large was almost comically loose both in the ""central area"" and around the legs. While I wear a large in everything else, I had to stick with the medium, and even then they are still loose and lacking much support. I believe it is the cut, not the sizing, that's causing this issue. Moreover, there appears to be too much extra fabric in back, which creates problems of its own that I am sure you can imagine. It is also important to point out that the fabric is not smooth, but rather ""waffled"" to an extent. There is one area in which the Give-N-Go excels, however, and that is durability and anti-microbial / odor properties.

If you're looking for a great non-cotton, travel ready boxer-brief, I'd recommend instead the Airism or Airism mesh series from Uniqlo. They accomplish the same thing, but fit like a dream, feel like silk and give you that ever-sought-after ""feels like I'm wearing nothing"" feeling.","Extremely loose fitting, irritating fabric"

I also felt like the strip running from the chest to the bikini area was too loose. If you're a B cup, and maybe have a more normal-length torso or longer, you'll fit this perfectly.

I bought it as an ""add on"" item since I needed just a few more dollars to qualify for free shipping and I was going to attend a private screening of the new Star Wars movie. Needless to say, I was very disappointed in this purchased. You can barely see the light if it comes on at all. At best, it's just a piece of costume decoration. Don't buy this for a child.

negative,2.0,"Both of our girls (ages 2 and 5) received one of these dresses each as a gift.  They were both so thrilled until my 5 year old tried it on and it was WAY too small.  Hers had to be returned.  The dress is one size and seems to be about a 3T, maybe a 4T.  My 2 year old wears 3T and it fits her nicely.  Here are the pros and cons:

Pros:
The removable skirt is great since it DOES fit my 5 year old so they can share the one dress (since it's really a dress with a detachable skirt)

Cons:
Runs small and only comes in the one size.
Quality is horrible.  We've had it a month and it's already fraying.
The dress when worn alone without the detachable shirt is VERY short (mini skirt length!)
And my biggest complaint, which is my I'm writing this review, is the plastic brooch sewn onto the neckline is a STICKER on plastic.  Since it is sewn onto the dress, it is not removable.  I had not noticed this was just a sticker of Sophia (instead of it being screen printed onto the plastic brooch as one should expect) until I was pulling it out of the wash machine and saw the sticker had peeled off into tiny little balls and my 2 year old gasped.  How gross that I can't wash this without it being ruined further!  All because they were cutting corners by using a sticker on a piece that is sewn on!  Urgh.",NOT washable!

I have to say lacing them up for the first time felt great because I was able to pull them super tight and it felt great for the first month or two but then one day I was lacing them up and the black sheath came off about 18 inches of it so now I had black and white shoe laces that I couldn't keep tied which was aggravating.

Also, although it says Reversible, the stitching at the top of the shoulder strap is obvious so people can tell you've reversed the bra. Though that style is so common these days, it may not matter to you. I personally don't like it when the stitching can be seen.

Since I live in Singapore, it's a waste of money to return the purchases, so I'll be using this, but with another bra underneath for added support.

neutral,3.0,"Instantly became my favorite shoes!  No breaking in at all and instant comfort.  They were the only shoes I brought to Honolulu and wore them for 5 days straight, and my feet were happy!  I love the fact that they are closed toed shoes but I do not feel hot or sweaty in them.  I did however add an Aldo terry cloth insole to them, so my feet would not stick to the footbed, and adds a little more cushioning.  The best part is the outsole, which is fabulous for walking on any type of terrain, as it has a lot of grip, and is super sturdy.  If you're traveling in warmer climate and can only bring one pair of shoes, these are it!  The reason I'm only giving them 4* instead of 5 is because the memory foam footbed compacts down pretty quickly and does not rebound after the first 2 wearings, making the front much more roomy (maybe even too roomy if you have a thinner foot).  I wish they would mix some other types of cushioning in addition to the memory foam layer for a more sustained cushion.

Update: May 6, 2017.  The memory foam has really packed down to almost non existence, and for the first time I was very uncomfortable walking in them, as the front is so loose and the heel has almost no padding.  So I've added a heel pad and it is feeling a lot more comfy now.  Will be adding a pad for the front too and see if it will help.  There is no excuse for using inferior foam in such an expensive shoe, as the cushioning in all my other shoes are still going strong after way more wearings.  Therefore I've deducted a star*

I hope you found my review helpful. If so, I would greatly appreciate it if you would click the HELPFUL or YES button. Thanks so much and Happy Shopping! :)",Instantly became my favorite shoes!  No breaking in at all and instant comfort.

I did a ""pack test""  I compared this bag to my cheap, 4 wheel, ""I don't care what happens to it"" bag which I got at one of those discount designer stores.  I was traveling with carry on for 5 days, which I often do.  I put all my stuff in this bag, and when I did, neither of the compartments were serviceable.  I couldn't even get a tablet in the side pouch, and my liquids would not fit in the top pouch.  I had to transition everything to my other bag for the trip.

This bag doesn't have a lot of ""give"" so when it's packed full, that's it. There's no more room for anything else.  I find that problematic.  Honestly,  think this bag would be better suited to men's clothing and toiletries.  Unless he's a guy who travels with a lot of shoes.",Video review

Pros: small profile and cute design. Comfortable and easy to wear.

Cons: instruction book was in the smallest font imaginable. The features are pretty limited and inaccurate.

You can track your steps, sleep, glasses of water, and exercise minutes, or set a custom goal. There are some other options like remote camera shutter and make your phone ring remotely.

I did a test to see how the step and sleep tracker worked. I'm a nursing mother to a 7 month old and typically get up twice a night. Last night I went to bed at 11pm, got up once at 2:30, and then was up for the day at 6:30am. The step tracker calculated my trip to the nursery and back twice (I checked this first thing in the morning) to be almost 100 steps. I measured it out and one trip should only be about 25 steps. It also said I only slept for 4.5 hours, which seems odd because I fell right asleep at 11pm, woke up at 6:15, and was only up with the baby once for about 15 minutes.

neutral,3.0,"I have a pair of medium blue ""Samantha""  style size 4 bootcut jeans in my closet that I bought a while ago. Since then, I've lost about 5 pounds and the jeans themselves have simultaneously gotten a bit stretched out simply due to regular washing and wearing. And while I still do wear them occasionally, they're definitely more ""baggy and slouchy"" than ""fitted and flattering"" at this point. So when I saw the ""licorice"" (black) color ""Samantha"" jeans in a size 2 at a crazy-low price, I was so excited - and certain they'd fit - that I immediately bought 2 pairs.

Unfortunately, it seems either that Miraclebody has changed their jeans sizing entirely OR the ""licorice"" jeans were inexplicably cut larger than other colors in the ""Samantha"" style - because both size 2's I received are at least the same size as, and seemingly even slightly larger than, my older stretched-out size 4 pair!

Given that these new jeans were (or should have been) essentially the same jeans as the ones I already had and loved, it was a real disappointment. Regardless, I'm hoping those particular jeans were just a fluke manufacturing or labeling error (which might explain why they were being offered at such an unusually low price). The Miraclebody brand doesn't seem to be as widely available as it was a couple of years ago so I don't have any recent purchases for a size comparison, but I'm very tempted to spring for a pair in the ""Pacifica"" color and cross my fingers that they fit as expected. If so, I'll be back to update this review accordingly...",Size 2 is now same size or even larger than older Miraclebody size 4 jeans?

The Citysafe 100 has all the positives of the bigger 200 purse--steel wire in the handle, steel mesh in the body, well-constructed, heavy-duty fabric. But it is considerably smaller and lighter.

In fact, it is almost too small, and I must agree with other reviewers who wish Pacsafe offered something in-between the 100 and 200.

The outside end pockets on the 100 are so small and so tight that they are useless except for perhaps carrying pencils or pens. My very thin cell phone does fit--however, once in, it is hard to get out because the pockets are so tight.

There are no other outside pockets. The 200 has a large outside zippered pocket (actually divided by stitching into two useless small pockets, but the stitches can be removed.) This purse has nothing like that and that's too bad, because an outside pocket would allow you to carry tickets, brochures, coupons, etc.

As with the bigger 200, I am considering making some modifications to the 100, which would include mesh water bottle end pockets with cord locks. I did this to the 200 and it was very useful on a 10-day trip to Paris. But once again I'm wondering why I have to make such heavy-duty alterations on a new purse.","Too small, needs more pockets"

Instead of paying few hundred for a shoe, this was ok, so not going to bother about the smell too much. Ferro Aldo shoes' design looked impressive thats the reason i bought these.

I suggest you go with the sizing guides, cause for me the reviews on here failed. As for the other aspects of the corset, if was nice enough, I didn't like the bows, it made it looks cheap.

neutral,3.0,"Fabric is nice and soft, I bought this to use under a sheer shirt, and this does work as an underlayer so I will wear it. Fit seems to be fine. I like the racerback style because it stays where it's supposed to as opposed to scoop front and back tanks.

The arms, neck and hem are serged edges which look cheap (but at least they lay flat). Even though it was ""only"" $10-11 delivered, this seems pricey for a very thin fabric undershirt. The ivory fabric was definitely see-through and would not work worn on its own, and would just look like a cheap tank top - which is what it is.

The fabric garment label is of a more robust fabric than the shirt and annoyed me sufficiently to cut it off.

Here is a question for the maker of these tanks. I wonder if the following is reasonable:
I have been looking for a good tank for use as an underlayer for some time. I took a chance on this out of desperation, a blouse I bought was too sheer to wear without that underlayer. I have never been able to figure out why what is basically an undershirt that guys can get in a 3-or 4-pack for almost nothing has to be so much more expensive when it's made for a woman. This garment's construction costs have to be pretty inexpensive - the fabric, cutting, serging, that's about all there is to it... but I paid $10 for it while it weighs maybe 4 oz. and it arrived in a small envelope. It's not as though tank top styles change that much, and when it's essentially a perennial item - a shirt like this should come in multiple packs to be useful. If it was available in multi packs I would love to see a 3- or 4 pack - which I would likely pay say $25 for .... that seems a reasonable price for something that looks so simple to produce.","Too expensive for the item, which is a basic undershirt"
neutral,3.0,"I just want to start with saying that this bag is durable as well as stylish, and I do love this bag. Unfortunately, due to the way this bag opens, it is not easily accessible. I find myself just dumping everything out of the bag on a regular basis just to grab my wallet or makeup bag.

The flap that attaches to the side of the bag makes it awkward to reach into the bag to grab stuff out. Also, the dimensions make it narrow and long, which doesn't allow for much room to search around inside of the bag.

So, if you are looking for a bag to use daily as a purse or messenger bag, and have more than just the minimal amount of items to carry around, I wouldn't suggest this bag.

neutral,3.0,"I like the idea of this watch more than the reality, alas. I'd been looking for a casual watch that I could wear on weekends or out on casual occasions, something that didn't have sparkle or glitz and went with a jeans and t-shirts look. This fit the bill -- but wearing it just didn't prove that comfortable and trying to use it for its intended purpose hasn't been that simple.

As far as the feel and looks/wearability goes: I love the strap, which is thick and yet comfortable. It's nice to find a strap that is this comfortable, although I think that it's a bit short: I have a relatively thin wrist (on bracelet watches, I usually have to have pieces removed and the fastening adjusted) and yet this watch is fastened on the next to last hole, with no room for additional holes to be made. Something to consider for people with thick wrists. I did find the watch as a whole on the heavy side to wear, and when I had to change the time (flying back and forth from Chicago) I had a lot of trouble with the knob not doing what it was supposed to. More significantly for me -- and this is a subjective issue -- I found the broad contrasting stripes actually bothered me when I was trying to read the time. The hands of the watch are so narrow that they kind of got lost in the big stripes, and I occasionally struggled to tell the time, and wound up pulling out my phone to verify that I had gotten it right. Several times, I hadn't.

So this will take a back seat among my watches for the time being. I've been wearing it only occasionally, and pulled it out to wear again recently to be sure I had given it a fair try. I had...","A bit on the heavy side, and (subjectively) the stripes are overwhelming"

The top of the bag is so much more narrow than the bottom that as things sunk into the main compartment, the bag became misshapen and more difficult to zip.

neutral,3.0,"There are some things I love about these, but also some things that I'm experiencing as I start to wear them that I think are good to pass along.  So today is the first day I have worn these.  I really like that they cover my foot and weren't slipping all day.  I have a wider width foot, and previous brands of this type of liner I bought were always slipping or pulling off of the heel.  This does have a gel type lining on the inside of the heel that probably helps keep it into place, but I also think that they elastic around the opening matters as well.  It tends to fit a bit snug.

As another reviewer has noted, these are going to be very visible in your flats.  So if that bothers you, then perhaps keep looking.  For me, I just really don't like the feel of sweaty feet in my flats, so I'm not about to go barefoot in any closed toed dress shoe really.  Not to mention, experience tells me that leads to stinky feet and stinky shoes, neither of which I enjoy.  So I place a higher priority on these staying on my feet then being invisible. And honestly, one of the amazing blessings that's come to me as the mom of a special needs kiddo is that I no longer care what people think about how I look in my clothes.  Standing in a dance studio waiting to pick your daughter up covered in puke will surely do that to you, among other things.  So I'm not really bothered by that so much, so it's an FYI for you.

The reason I took stars off is that after one day of wearing these, there is already considerable wear visible to the areas contacted by the shoes shown in picture one.  Those shoes, by the way, are wide width, and they are not in any way, shape, or form snug across the top of my foot.  My life needs shoes that I can walk, stand, etc. comfortably in all day long.  The fabric is pilled up, thinned out, and showing signs of distress in those areas.  The top side of the pilling is shown in picture two.  Also, in case you are sensitive to such things, note the pinkish red line where the sock has shifted as I moved my foot to take the picture.  These things grip enough to leave a mark, indent and color wise.  So again, if that's something that bothers you, it's something to be aware of.  It didn't really cause me any issues where I noticed it during the day, but someone with sensory issues or skin sensitivities might.

So while I love that I didn't spend all day pulling these up, they are showing enough signs of distress to indicate they are not going to be so durable.  So it's probably a good thing I won't be wearing flats too much in the summer months...",Showing Too Much Damage for One Wear

For those of us with high arches this shoe is troublesome because of the strap at the top. Particularly where the two straps meet and form a bump with a particularly inflexible (stiff) and unsmooth juncture which presses in to the top of the (very bony) part of the foot. For my feet these are an impossible design. Which is sad because they were adorable.

The best thing about these boots is how small they make your foot look.  It's a neat optical illusion the way the sole cuts inward below the tip of the toe, because your eye registers the shoe as being much smaller than it really is.  So that's a plus.

Still, they are comfortable after breaking in (doesn't take long with the dual density soles.) I really appreciate the aluminum toe, which gives protection with little added weight. They support my ankles well when I walk on uneven dirt slopes at landfills and demolition sites. The soles do show some wear, and I suspect that they might not hold up as well for a guy who does heavier work than I do.

I bought mine at a Red Wing store. They measured my feet and told me I would need an 8.5EE. I told them I'd been comfortable wearing a 9D for nearly 40 years now... but they were right!

neutral,3.0,"Fine watch. Heavy, clean design. Keeps accurate time. Absolutely no issues with the part of the watch that keeps time, the case.

The band, however, is a complete abomination. Clarification. The band is fine, the clasp is a walking disaster of legendary proportions. If you set a mechanical engineer to design the most problematic, least functional, horror show of a clasp, it still wouldn't be as bad as the unit on this watch.

First of all, who puts a disconnecting clasp on a heavy men's watch? When you manage to undo the clasp, the watch case is heavy enough to instantly topple the watch over, sending it sliding off your wrist onto whatever surface is below your feet. But, at least it's not that easy to undo.

That's the second problem. It's easy to unlock the clasp, but getting the hooked lever side off of the bar that it locks onto is an exercise in pure frustration. Once unlocked, there is no easy way to push, pull, move the two parts of the clasp to easily and reliably separate the two free ends of the band. Push on the lever? No. Pull on it? No. Push while trying to lift the bar? No. The clasp locking mechanism is designed such that however you choose to grip or apply pressure fails to move the two free ends into a relationship where they readily separate. My description is a mess because the mechanism is a mess.

But you only have this problem if you get the watch on and clasp secured. When you try to close the clasp, it reliably gets stuck or wedged on the retaining bar and forcing it doesn't help. You have to jiggle it and sometimes undo it entirely and restart again to get the clasp over the bar it grabs onto and try and close it again. My god, but this thing is an unmitigated failure. I cannot imaging how this design made it past proving.

Now, once you have figured out how to get it on, you can at least remove links to achieve that perfect fit, right? Not exactly. Unlike a typical buckle clasp, there is no micro adjustment capability. There is no series of holes for you to move spring pins around in half-link increments to customize the fit to some wrists. If you're lucky, you'll get to the point where taking out just the right number of links makes the watch sit perfectly right above the wrist. If you're unlucky, like me, taking out 5 links will make the band too tight. Taking out 4 links makes it so loose that it slides down past the wrist so the crown digs into the back of your hand. Too bloody tight or too floppy loose. Take your pick.

I was sooo close to sending this back because I hated this disaster of a clasp so much. It really does sour the experience of an otherwise really nice, solid man's watch. Instead, I researched here and ordered a replacement band made by MiLTAT. Once that comes in and I've had a chance to install it, I'll be back to post my impressions and perhaps some photos.

So, bottom line is unless you really love the case and movement and can get it at a good price and are willing to deal with the mess of a clasp or buy a replacement band, stay away from this problematic unit. I just cannot imagine that any Victorinox could have given the green light for such a total train wreck of a band clasp.","Nice watch, horrific, torturous band clasp"

My only complaint is that the legs are very short and if they are worn during exercise or a run, the friction can become very irritating so I deducted a star.

I took off another star because I asked the vendor for a longer leg version of this same brief. I was directed to a version of this brief with a longer leg that turned out to be nothing like these briefs, except for the material. The other version has different seams which ride up your back side, a higher waistline which I hated, and they don't come in black. Basically, NOT the longer leg version of this.","4 star briefs, 3 star vendor"

It does fit snugly but I think it is really the Spandex.  If I could relax the Spandex a bit, I would really like this jacket.  I love the number of pockets, especially the fore arm pocket.  I use it for my ID card.  I love the hood with the visor.  I wear it to work over a tee shirt and polo shirt normally.  I would say it would be comfortable no lower than the high 40s F by itself.  You could extend that if you wore a fleece or sweater underneath.  It is more comfortable in the 50s F though.  I have worn it in some pretty good wind and rain storms.  Wind intrusion is not a problem.  So far, the rain has not penetrated the material either.  The slash pockets are a little high up for me though.  It could be an inch or 2 longer in the overall length.  It could also be a bit more packable.  I wanted it to roll up in the bottom of my work back pack for when I travel.

For me, that didn't quite work because, having heavily ridged nails, this polish did NOT apply smoothly, and did not allow me to leave my nail with complete coverage of polish over my nails.  So that meant I had to apply another brand of base coat over that in order to be able to finish my manicure.

As far as hardening properties, can't say this did much of anything.  Some of my nail are fairly pliable, and even with this hardener they basically stayed the same after application.

Don't get my wrong they are most likely perfect for putting your things in to separate in your suitcase or carry on (maybe shoes? socks undergarments) but I am glad I only paid 1/4 of the price they are asking for regularly because it was an ""add on"" deal.

When up, the hood raises the shoulders which causes pressure on one's head, making it very uncomfortable.  Im not sure that's clear.  In other words, when one puts up the hood there's more than an inch gap between your own shoulder and that of the hoodie.

Though I will not post my own photos, you can see from other review photos that, while the design is extremely similar, it is not exact. I was quite disappointed when I had realized so.

However, I still do quite like the swimsuit. Like I said, they are very similar designs and it fit nice, though a bit tight around my hips. Make sure to follow the size chart, you'll most likely order 2 sizes bigger than what you're used to, but measure yourself just to check.

The material is comfortable, I had a bit of difficulty situating my breasts (D cup) at first but eventually I managed. The cups in the fabric are removable, though I've chosen to keep mine in. As for the underwire, it was a bit awkward and taking it out would be difficult, though I'm keeping that in as well.

neutral,3.0,"The clipper, nail file, and tweezers are a nice stainless steel. The slanted tweezers work well.  They grasp the hair and pull it from the root instead of just breaking it.  The nail file is wonderful.  One side is coarse and the other side is fine.  Both sides work extremely well to shape and seal nails.

The nail clipper, on the other hand, is a bit flimsy and hard to open.  It's also made of stainless steel, but it's so thin that its difficult to cut your nails. Unfortunately, the design is great but it falls short on functionality.  I find that it slips out of place.  I have long nails and I bent one of them when the nail clipper slipped out of position.  I won't be using it again.  I'll stick with my Trim nail clipper.

neutral,3.0,"These shoes have a comfortable footbed with memory foam that provides all day comfort. The front straps are non-adjustable and are designed for a wide foot. Since I have a wide foot I was pleased but they would be too loose for narrow feet. I wish they had been made adjustable.  It's great for people who stand on their feet all day but I wouldn't recommend them for a lot of walking as the front straps can loosen up after a while and the foot slides a little which can get really uncomfortable on long walks.

The ankle strap has a velcro but my feet swell during summer at the ankles or after long periods of sitting and the strap is too short, or rather the velcro does not come up far enough so I can seal the strap when my ankles swell. This renders them useless to me. Since I got them on a good Amazon deal, rather than return them I am going to stick some more Velcro on them. I just have to find the right color so it does not look bad.
Update: see pic I found sticky Velcro dots (for fabrics) at JoAnn in a similar color and stuck them on so the strap can be looser and fit. The Velcro dots are available on Amazon too, but at a higher price.

There is not much arch support on these sandals, but it's seldom that you can find any with good arch support. At least it provides memory foam comfort to my feet so they don't get all rough and chapped.

neutral,3.0,"Things I like about these stockings... #1 they are actually my skin tone... As I have gotten older (I'm in my early 30s) I have embraced my fair skin tone and I try to avoid getting too much sun (and my legs never tanned anyway). I have always bought the barely there color, because in stores it usually is the lightest color. This has always baffled me quite a bit because I don't really view myself as being pale, or porcelain... I even have a couple of friends with fairer skin.. but I was SO pleased with this color. They look nude on my skin.

Things I don't like about these stockings. I have only been able to wear each pair 2-3 times before they are just shredded. I'm not sure why this is happening, I buy other hanes stockings and don't have this issue, but the material feels less silky and all of a sudden I just get a big hole and there is no option of just spraying hairspray or putting a dab of clear nail polish to stop the run for the remainder of the day. As a bonus: since the stockings are so close to my skin color, it is barely noticeable when I get these catastrophic runs.

The stockings I have been sent are definitely not control top.... The package says they are... but these just feel like regular stockings at the waist...

This review started out as a 4, because that is how much I love the color... but based on the limited times I can wear them and not living up to their product description, I knocked it down to 3 stars... (If the color wasn't so fantastic it would only be 2 stars though). I wear stockings every week day...

neutral,3.0,"Part of me wonders why Amazon Vine keeps offering me clothes way out of the size range I indicated on my preferences, but I'd guess that might be for family members and close friends to try them out. In any case, size medium wasn't too far fetched for a loose, floaty style like this, so I sprung for it. (BTW, if Amazon has their headphones on, medium or large in a junior's line with its smaller, different proportions usually fits me just right.) This size and style hangs loosely, but it's not ridiculously voluminous around and not too long.

Although I imagined blush would be a peachy color and not red flowers on pink background, that's partly opinion. I discovered the flower print and camel tan pants created a nice color palette; any intensity of almost any blue would look good, too. The entire top is very see-through, so minimally you'd need to wear a cami or tank top underneath, or a lightweight long-sleeved solid color jersey as I did. The loose flowing sleeves with no way to gather them in to your wrist and secure them are my major point of contention and I need to ask why that style? Recently the fashion world has featured a spate of sweaters and jackets without buttons, belts, or sashes to keep them closed. Possibly to save a pittance during production, gain a few pennies at retail by not adding buttons, buttonholes, a sash, or a belt. Before I wear this top again, I'm going to gather the sleeves onto a band (probably not elastic) so they don't flap around in such a silly manner. And the price is way too high!

neutral,3.0,"I bought this pith helmet to accompany a beekeeping veil. There is no doubt in my mind that the hard plastic shell of the helmet will prove to be impervious to bee stings. Although the fit is a little too tight for my fat head, I purchased it for my daughter and it fits her comfortably, if a bit loosely.

As popular as this helmet is with people buying their first batch of beekeeping equipment though, I'm not sure I would recommend it for that use. The plastic shell is lightweight, comfortable in the heat, and keeps bees off the scalp, but the smooth surface does not ""hold"" onto the elasticized hem of the beekeeper's veil, so it slips and slides as we work near the hive. That could turn out to be really problematic. A better solution would probably to buy a wide-brimmed hat made from heavy cotton duck or oilskin, which is what I did for myself and which works very well.","Good quality, Might not recommend for beekeeping."

neutral,3.0,"The extent of RFID snooping may be somewhat hyped, but as products like one designed by Bishop Fox show (sorry, you'll have to look it up), it's more of an issue in industrial settings than for individual citizens.

That said, this wallet has RFID snooping resistance as a net plus.

The design has 3 card pockets on each side, and space for a couple more by sliding beneath.

The wallet seems sturdy, though I notice there is a stitch on the outside surface that might conceivably break after heavy use.

I would rather have a much fatter wallet that held more cards and IDs. The cards and gadgets have to go somewhere, hence the popularity of cargo pants, with their numerous pockets ready for smartphones, battery packs, keys, and -- relevant to this discussion -- a wallet and the overflow cards that don't fit in one.

The typical wallet design -- can you blame Lewis N Clark for designing to the popular notion? -- is designed for paper currency, but with some occasional exceptions, currency is less often used by many of us. I needed it today for a cash-only venue, but that was the first time in six weeks, so I had only a general idea what was in the wallet. Wallets should be designed less for paper currency and more for IDs and paper maps (e.g., folding map or mass transit schedule -- needed during smartphone outages or travel settings).

Style

Functionality wise, the scarf is quite thin. When held out in front of you it is nearly see through. Therefor it doesn't do great at keeping you warm. Most likely fine for anything above 40 like a chilly autumn day or a warm winter day. But bellow that you will feel the cold come right through.

And style wise, same problem. The scarf is very thin and the knitted pattern is very feminine. If that is a style that doesn't concern you or what you're looking for then more power to you! I was just looking for a simpler more masculine type design to it. That is all.

I'm 5'4"", ~112 lbs., fairly straight figure, 32A bust, 26"" waist, 32"" hips;  the size small fit me great everywhere except the chest.  The top of this chemise is sewn so that it has two slightly ""cup-formed"" areas that will accommodate a larger chest, and this area puckered on me, much like a too-big bra.

I finally decided it was too cute to pass on, but when I received it I knew instantly it was too big. I put it on and tried to find an attractive way to arrange it, but honestly it looks like I'm wearing a tent. I think for a larger woman with a bigger bust size than my 36 C's it might be a better fit, but for my size or smaller you're going to look and feel ridiculous.

Update 7-7-2016; One big drawback is in the wear dept. The soles are thin and shallow in the tread. Would have been a great boot if the designers designed a deeper tread on the sole.
The soles are wearing baled within 4 months. You wouldn't get past a year with this sole if you wear them everyday.
If the mfg. re-fits the boot with a deeper tread sole, you have a winner, However, the sole should never wear out before the rest of the boot does, which this sole will..",Not long on duration

Did you ever put on a pair of hose that was all kind of crooked and you had to remove, adjust and re-wear them? Well, that is more of less the case here, except you don't get to fix them by taking them off and putting them on again because... these leggings were sewn backwards!!! Yes, meaning that the back is sewn in front and viceversa.  The bandages still are in the front, but the waistband goes very high (almost to the ribcage) in front and so low in the back, that it is ridiculous.  The front is slightly roomier -the area that would accommodate your buttocks in a perfect pair of leggings, while in the back you run the risk of showing the beginning of your derriere -to say it nicely- and they tend to go up in between the cheeks in a way that is kind of (sorry) a reverse camel toe!!! They are still wearable, but not very comfortable due to the explained issue which makes them tight in the back and loose in front,  and of course, I can only wear them with something on top, but never just as leggings.

neutral,3.0,"These shoes have a leather upper with no seams around the toes, which is a big plus to me because sometimes sneakers with stitching around the toe box rub and irritate my little toes.  No problem with that.  The toe box has plenty of room, too.

These shoes fit very well.  The tongue is gusseted with elastic fabric.  This keeps it in place, and I hoped it would prevent pressure on my instep.  It's difficult to find shoes with gusseted tongues, but I've owned them before and that feature made the shoes very comfortable.  In the case of these shoes, however, though the gussets keep the tongue from sliding around, I still get pressure on my instep.

When I first wore them, I thought I'd wind up returning them.  The sole has very little flexion and my feet felt a bit bound.  But they are leather, and after I wore them a few times, they ""broke in.""  What I mean is, the leather stretched some, allowing my feet to flex a bit.

The heel is a bit wide, and a little bit too low.  Like many people, I tend to put my weight on my heels, especialy when I'm tired.  Due to the shape and shallowness of the heel, I must make a concerted effort to center my weight properly.  There is good arch support, as well as heel support, though the heel support is diminished due to the aforementioned flaws.

These shoes are good for walking, but ironically, not so good for lateral movement.  The heel slippage and instep pressure cause foot fatigue.

neutral,3.0,"This is such a cool watch. When I got it I was breath taken upon opening tho box it came in, even though I had looked at plenty of pictures online. The pictures online just cant prepare you for the real thing. It looks so modern and original and high tech, yet has a relatively simple design. I was skeptical of the Chinese Seagull movement, but it does look beautiful in person and I was pleasantly surprise to find that the movement is hacking. It is very heavy too, which I really do enjoy, it feels very solid!

Why only 3/5 stars? Because of the fit and accuracy. The watch is made for big wrists. Android customer service will tell you that the cuffs will overlap for smaller wrists - and they will, but not far past 0.5cm. I can still wear it, and do, but a better fit would be nice. Maybe if future generations of Hydraumatic watch came with a set of smaller interchangeable cuffs a wider variety of customers could enjoy it. Also I expected better accuracy from the mechanical movement, I loose about 30 seconds a day, regardless of how much I wind it. I know the Seagull movements are inexpensive Asian movements, but I have a similarly priced mechanical Miyota that looses about a minute a week.

Overall a very cool looking and feeling watch. I'm very happy I got mine.",Pictures don't do it justice.

I found them on Amazon, then decided rather than refer her to them, I would simply buy them for her upcoming birthday at the end of September. She lives in another state, but flew home the day I placed the order. They arrived during her visit, and she went nuts over them! (this was before she even opened the box).After squeezing the sh*t out of me with a hug, she grabbed the boots and put them on. They were gorgeous at first sight! They fit exactly the way she hoped, they looked the way she had hoped, and in fact, she wore them Friday evening to an event only a few hours after getting them! She wore them for about 7 hours, and commented that they were still comfy. BEST hundred bux spent for her, if I do say so myself! Great job, Chinese Laundry, and bravo, Amazon Prime, for once again coming through for me, with next day shipping for a mere 3.99, which was so so worth it!

positive,5.0,"I love these work pants.  They fit as expected.  They are a good mid-weight - not too heavy or rigid, but still tough and good for year round wear.  Pretty darn durable as well.  I bought my first pair of these on Amazon a little over a year ago.  I wear them quite frequently for work, and they have held up great. Dickies are usually a great value, but I have had issues in the past finding the right size with some Dickies styles -which is incidentally my biggest complaint about Dickies, overall.  There seems to be no consistency from style to style (or even sometimes with differing colors of the same style) regarding sizing and fit for Dickies pants.  The styles of Dickies that Walmart carries seem to run about a size and a half too small.  I typically wear 34x30, and I couldn't button the Wal-Mart Dickies in that size with a pair of vice grips.  However, the 36x30 in the same style are way too baggy for me.  I also had the same problem with the first pair of Dickies I tried from Amazon - https://smile.amazon.com/Dickies-Mens-Relaxed-Duck-34x30/dp/B000PSVEUW/ref=sr_1_1?s=apparel&ie=UTF8&qid=1490228952&sr=1-1&nodeID=7147441011&psd=1&keywords=Dickies%2BMen's%2BRelaxed%2BFit%2BDuck%2BJean%2C%2BMoss%2C%2B34x30&th=1&psc=1.

 Fit is OK but Im not sure how you would go at the larger ends of the scale. Not real thick but they are not designed to be and come in a really small box which makes you wonder how they can get six sets of socks in there until you see how small they are.

 They stretch OK but are less stretchy than regular socks in my opinion which means you have to put them on the right way otherwise they won't fit. Still, they fit so little to complain about - Ill update if any issues after a wash.

All these items fit but I can't zip it up. My sunglasses case made it difficult to get in so I had to just keep them in the car which is disappointing since I usually need them when I am also not in the car.

positive,5.0,"Purchased so many from other choices on line trying to find the right size and fit, right style and cuteness and almost gave up when I decided to give it one last shot before I headed to the store to pay much more than anyone needs to.
So I gave this a shot and boy, am I glad I did. This is all that and then some. I purchased the tortoise because I plan to have my transition lenses transferred and I find the dark lenses look much cuter with a brown frame.
I have a broad face and these are just the right size. Not consuming  nor conspicuous. They just compliment. I also tried them on my sister who has a much narrower face and they are also perfect. So they will work for anyone. They seem very sturdy and do not look cheap at all. Famous brand names have only one thing one these...their exorbitant prices, which we do not need.

I really love Lucky brand Women's tops, but I don't think this is a good fit for me with the baseball shirt type shoulders. It just makes me look bigger than I am. X1 is my size though, maybe I am too old or busty to wear it. The model has much broader shoulder than me, and it hangs well on her.

The point of mine is droopy not pointy and upright as pictured. That isn't too bad and sort of adds a twisted wicked witch thing but the real disappointment is the brim.

There is a head covering that is fitted into the hat and the brim - and that is cool, keeps the hat snugged down and looks sophisticated... but the brim, although bent like shown, doesn't line up so that it has that nice graceful curve over the front. Instead it's about half way off. It will work but it isn't quite as cool as the picture.",A bit of a disappointment.

If that's not an issue, I'd concur with the majority here; these khakis feel soft and elegant, fit nicely and look good.","great fit and finish, weak color"

positive,5.0,"I purchased this for my comic-book nerd boyfriend and he absolutely loves it.  It has stitching!  That's what he keeps saying.  I guess because the stars and stripes are sewn rather than printed, it's a big deal for him.  It's made from quality materials, it hasn't faded.  The only thing I can say about this t-shirt if that if you're waffling between sizes, go with the larger.  It doesn't stretch out over time.",Boyfriend LOVES it!

positive,5.0,"I have to review this jacket because it has lasted over a year for us. My son is small for his age so take that into consideration. We bought this in November, 2015 when he was 8 months old and at 22 months, this size still fits (snugly but it fits). It's one of the only 6-12 things he still wears. He wears 18-24 mo in most pants and shirts. This is a fantastic jacket to wear in the car seat as it's not bulky at all and was recommended by the Car Seat Lady blog. It's been appropriate for temps as low as 40s and 50s. I plan to buy him a 2T next and let him grow into that one. Given how inexpensive this is, I was even more pleased it lasted that long. I wouldn't say there's much stretch to it but I feel it runs larger than normal shirt sizing. It's the perfect fall or early spring jacket and a great first layer for much colder temps.",Fantastic fleece jacket
positive,5.0,"This dress is perfect. It fit as expected. Although the packaging sucks, but no big deal just put it on a clothes hanger and hang it on the shower curtain.

positive,5.0,"Got this to replace my wedding ring and band that I accidentally broke while working on our Ford Expedition together. I wanted something lightweight that wouldn't break, as well as something smooth that would never scratch me or our young children.

It shipped quickly, and looks pretty, but it's very thick, and a little bit loose on my finger. If it was a 4 1/2 instead of a 5 and half as thick I might like it more. We got a great deal on the price, but I don't know if I'll be able to wear it 24/7 like I would like to.","Beautiful, but thick."

It is simply a brilliant idea - one of those ""why didn't I think of that"".  You will not go wrong ordering this product.",Outstanding Product & Company
positive,4.0,"These shoes are really comfortable to stand in, but the plastic coated strip up the top of the toes means they bend really oddly and rub on your toes when you run (or otherwise flex the toe box). I'm hoping that this is something that'll loosen up/break in over time, but the first few wearings have definitely made me aware of this flaw! It's not painful, per se, but it's just irritating enough that I think over multiple miles, it could end up ouchy.

The cushioning, however, is GREAT. I really appreciate Altra for making zero-drop running shoes that still have that ground-protection. I run mainly on asphalt and while I love my Nike Bionic Frees and New Balance Minimus Zeros for sprints and gym work, I like a little more padding between me and the gravel and concrete when I'm putting in the miles!

Aesthetic note: be aware that the colors are SUPER bright and, when combined with the wide toe-box, can remind you of clown shoes or bowling shoes. I don't find this a drawback, personally, but I understand why someone else might.","Stiff plastic on toe is a drawback, but otherwise awesomely cushioned zero-drop shoe"

My patience paid off and we got this for an excellent price on Amazon and I love it. Beautiful and goes with everything! The picture does not do it justice.

positive,5.0,"So far so good!  I've never had any type of wallet, and after reading the reviews and as well as noticing the product itself looked very nice and looked of very good quality, I decided to give it a try.  One reason was to get the RFID benefit, due to upcoming travels, I felt I better protect my cards/ID better.
After having received it and using it for the past couple of weeks now I can say it has taken some getting used to.  I""ve always used a tri-fold type mostly throughout my life.
This Money clip type wallet definitely does not hold as much as my old billfolds, but it has allowed me to eliminate the unnecessary cards and crap that I used to carry around for basically no reason, other than ""it might come in handy some day"" reason.  Lame right.  Every man can realte I'm sure, right?
Getting used to it is coming along nicely, and the wallet is loosening up little by little as I use it daily.  The first several days I could barely get the cards back out from the two card slots on either side, but I do have them pretty much to capacity.  The product info indicates that each of the two slots holds up to six cards, which is about right, but like I said they are in there pretty tight, but slots are indeed loosening up as the real genuine leather gets broken in and sat on (in my pocket) and whatnot.
I love the look of the leather and I've already gotten a few compliments on it as well.",Minimalist in a big way!

positive,4.0,"This product is a very sturdy yet pliable vinyl material, it's definitely going to last a while but it's not the color I expected. I ordered the 'rose red' color and online it looks like a pinky/red color and it's very dark in person. Almost brown or maroon. The closest to red I would classify is oxblood and that's still too red for this color.

On the bright side it does have tons of pockets and as long as the color doesn't bleed on the inside o my bag if damp, I will be completely satisfied.

PROS: Pockets, very portable, easy to use and transport,offers a lot of space for little volume.

CONS: Color, netting feels very fragile.",It serves its purpose

positive,5.0,"Okay, let's get this out of the way - this backpack is expensive. I admit if this weren't available as a Vine item, I wouldn't pay so much for a backpack because I'm too frugal. But, if you're looking for a designer-label backpack for the masses, you're already prepared to pay a bit more for the item.

The bag is suitable for all genders. I can fit an older 15"" Macbook Pro circa 2009 with a non-SSD hard drive and a Super-Drive in the lightly padded laptop pocket, with the two corners touching the top of the bag without stretching the bag or struggling to stuff it in. I've already decided this bag is what I'll use to transport my old laptop.

The backpack is very classy and understated, which is how I prefer my products. The outer material feels very sturdy and uses thicker nylon fabric. The inside is lined, unlike many cheaper backpacks. The zippers slide smoothly. The zipper pulls are big for easy zippering. The bottom panel has something stiff inside for support, giving this a bit more structured look. The slightly rounded boxy look also uses space more efficiently.

I like that the bag doesn't have a dozen compartments. It doesn't have a special panel for headphone wires, pen holders and other tiny pockets. Besides the laptop pocket, the main compartment has two additional pockets and a zippered compartment, along with the zippered outer compartment. However, I do wish this had a water bottle holder, though I admit adding one would take away from its simple, refined look.

This has a bit of that premium feel than the book bags I'm used to. The black color gives this an elegant look. It's a very nice bag without screaming, ""I'm expensive - steal me.""","Classy, comfortable, sturdy backpack made of nice material."

I am not pregnant w/ my 2nd with just a little more time to go.  This bra will serve me very well as a sleep bra now and then as a sleep and nursing bra (even though the cups don't open up, the wrap front will be almost as good) after baby is here.

positive,5.0,LOVE THESE & FINALLY THE PRICE WAS RIGHT. I SIMPLY REFUSE TO PAY MORE THAN I THINK A PRODUCT IS WORTH.,THE PRICE IS RIGHT!
positive,5.0,"O. M. G. I can honestly say I have never worn more comfortable underwear in my life.

I don't like to spend a lot of money on underwear, and my standard has for several years been off-the-shelf multipacks of Hanes or FotL. But they stretch and sag over the course of a day. When retail outlets stopped carrying single-color packs of them (I don't care for dark-colored underwear, and the mixed-color multipacks always have a dark color in them, usually black), I decided it was finally time to look at something a bit higher up the ladder.

I found these here on Prime Day 2017, when they were roughly half their usual price. The reviews were overwhelmingly positive, so I decided to splurge and buy four packs while they were on sale. I figured I'd open just one pack, and if I didn't like them, I'd just return the other three. (I'm not crass enough to try to return underwear that's been worn, even if it was for less than a minute.)

Needless to say, I won't be returning them. Thanks to the spandex content, they don't sag at all after a full day's wearing. The material is incredibly soft and comfortable, so much so that I now wonder how I put up with the coarser material of the mass-market stuff. They don't appear to have suffered any significant effects from washing. Some reviews have complained about the sewn-in logo tag, but I haven't had any issue with it. They are, quite simply, awesome. I will be buying more at the regular price (which is still lower per pair than many of the higher-end brands), and will continue to buy these as long as they are available (assuming the quality remains the same).

As for the eco-friendly marketing, well, I'm too cynical to believe that any of it is true just because they say it. I'm not saying I think they're lying, but most companies that tout the ""green-ness"" of their products are at minimum exaggerating. So my recommendation doesn't take that into account, either pro or con. I recommend these based solely on the quality of the product I gotand that quality makes them worth every cent of the price.",Worth every penny

positive,4.0,"Ok, here we go. I have been dying to do this review... I have a ring that is size 7. I have a ring finger that is a size 6-6.5 and a middle finger that is a 7.5. I need to up the size of the ring or reduce it but either way it doesn't fit. $30 to enlarge (or reduce) it professionally by resizing or $15 to reduce it with ""plastic"". Interesting concept so I figured... what have I got to lose. I have other rings that are 1/2 sizes to big also.

Well, I got the product and read the directions carefully. I bent the hanging hook up and anchored the card under a heavy book for extra stability. I opened the can and peeled back the film and looked at the contents. Relatively clear and sticky... hmm, ok. I took the ring but the face in my thumb and middle finger and dipped about 1/2 way in and sort of scooped it forward. I got a good glob on the inside and coated the outside. I checked to make sure the edges were covered and hung it on the hook. Now here is where I think people get into trouble. I left it alone for 2 days. When I got home from my weekend vacation I looked at it and it seemed flat inside. No glob at all. It had settled into a well. I put the ring on and felt the texture of the the product. It has a certain kind of rubbery texture that seems to give it some gripping power. Still, it is a little big so I dipped it again. Instructions say you can so here we go again. I followed the same procedure and waited 24hours. I put the ring on this morning and it isn't tight and has that rubbery gripping power and is kind of comfortable. I can dip it again but I am happy right here.

Now, you don't want to go rubbing on the edges because they will come up and will be rubbery ( I think the name of ""plastic"" they use is a bit of a misnomer) If you wash your hands, the ring will feel a little slick. Just take the ring off and dry your hands well and put it back on- no problem. I think this might last for a bunch of wearings. I don't intend to wear it every day. This is just a right hand ring anyway. I have lots of them. I have included pictures so you can see what this stuff looks like. You can see that there is no mess on the front of the ring. You can also see that if rubbed it will peel up a bit but I think in a few weeks after wearing it a few times I will just redip or peel the current coat off and redo the application. I hope you like this product. I think it is kind of handy. I don't like the metal clips you can install in your ring because they can come loose and scratch you and the plastic round things have a habit of falling out when I take the ring off or the ring slides in a circle on my finger. I hope this helps some of the unhappy people too. Try it again and see if it works better.",Works for half size increases very well.

I think part of my disappointment was that so many reviewers mentioned how there was no bounce at all when they wore this bra, even for larger chested gals.  I did not find this to be the case at all (maybe they were doing lower impact exercise?), but then again, I found ""no bounce"" to be hard claim to believe in the first place.

positive,5.0,"I bought this ring to wear during trips so I could leave my wedding set in a secure place.  I had previously been using a titanium band, but it became scratched and dull after 2 trips.  After reading up on tungsten, I decided to buy this ring.  I *love* this ring.  The weight reminds me of platinum.  It is a domed ring,approximately 1mm thick, but I don't mind that. I find it to be very comfortable to wear.  I normally wear 3 bands on my ring finger and the 6mm width is perfect for me, as I've developed a permanent indent from my wedding set.  If your finger widens below the knuckle, this may rub a bit against your other fingers--but with Amazon's free returns policy on it give it a try.  I knew going in that the color would be gunmetal gray, which I find lovely--if you're looking for a silver-toned ring (i.e. silver/platinum/white gold appearance), this isn't for you. The shine on the ring is incredible and I'll be interested to see if it truly holds up.

positive,5.0,"I just received this 30 minutes ago, but my first impression is that it's a better deal at a higher quality than I expected. The face is large enough that I can read it w/o my glasses. It looks and feels sturdy. The battery model, as another reviewer mentioned, is stamped on the back of the watch, and a similar feature is that the band's width--24mm--is written on the band. Finally, most cheap watches have soft faces, meaning they scratch up in no time; this one is said to have a harder face. Now, if only the battery will last a few years...

update: months have past. the watch keeps time to about 15 seconds/month. as clumsy and as active as i am, the watches' face could easily be scratched beyond usability, and yet there isn't a scratch visible. i wear the watch 24/7, meaning in the rain and in the shower, and not only is the mechanism well-sealed, but the watch band still looks new.",first impression: well worth it... and update

It kinda catches on my clothing and I'm a little concerned that the stone with eventually fall out because of it. To be fair, the ring is such a low price ($2) so it's not totally surprising.

positive,4.0,"I have been running on these for about 4 months.  I put about 20 - 30 miles per week on them since I bought them with a grand total of just over 300 miles on them (I alternate between 2 pairs of these for longer life).  They have been going strong but are now starting to show signs it's time to replace them.  Most of my miles are on road pushing a baby jogger and these have held up to the task with flying colors.  Like most minimalistic shoes, yes you can feel sharp rocks but the rock is 2 steps behind you before your brain registers you stepped on it, at least that's how it does it with me.  These shoes have gone up to marathon distances without any issues.

I have only one gripe about them, you need to wear socks.  My first run in them was without socks, as I prefer to run in hotter weather.  I got a great big blister on my arch from a seam inside the shoe.  Since then I added a little body glide before long runs and have not had any issues.  I point this out because the shoe stated it was great for running without socks.  The time I got the blister it was only a 4 mile run so it was not like it was a long distance where I have learned to expect blisters.

Aside from this the shoes are  great investment.  I just ordered a new pair for a Christmas present to me.",Great lightweight minimalistic running shoe.

(1) Material: Like with all official Pusheen tops I've bought (3 Ts including this one, 1 sweatshirt), the fabric quality is soft and excellent. Definitely higher quality than shirts you'd buy at Target or other popular stores.
(2) Fit: I'm happy that with multiple washings (maybe 3?), it now is a better fit on my shoulders and stomach. (I'm 5'5, approx 140lbs.) It also looks nice on my bust (D), but read on.
(3) Print: The image is cute and funny. The print is definitely ""screened on"" in a ""thicker"" way than most printed shirts. The intention is likely that the image will withstand many washes, without fading. ~Yet--with my larger bust, it's a weird feeling.~ The large Pusheen image wraps around and under my breasts, so they feel strangely ""contained"" by the image's heavier imprint material. I've never experienced this effect before. The image may begin ""cracking"" over time with the bust situation, but again, I recognize this shirt was intended for men and my situation is odd. But, FYI for women with bigger busts.

Summary: I like this shirt. I gave it 4/5 stars because it's a terrific shirt, yet the feel with the larger print is strange and unexpected. I won't dock for the overall fit, though, because I knew what I was getting into. Overall, Gund's Pusheen items continue to be higher quality. They cost more than average shirts because Pusheen is ""so hot right now,"" much like Hansel, but I still want to rock a DJing Pusheen.","Ladies, read for fit with larger busts"
positive,4.0,"Very cute and seems of good quality.  I'm a 32DD, and I usually wear a size 6.  Thought a large would be okay, but it's definitely too small (both top and bottoms).

positive,5.0,"This is a perfectly gorgeous jacket, and the fake leather really looks and feels convincing. I'd say that this jacket runs TRUE TO SIZE, Hillfiger products are usually cut generously, that has been my experience in the past. My hubby adores this jacket and appreciates the fact that there's no ""cow smell"" as is common with leather jackets especially in the Summer when it gets warm.

This jacket has a classic look and appeal with bomber jacket styling. It's waterproof too,which is super handy if you get caught out in a storm and don't want to ruin your nice leather jacket. It fits really well and is generously cut in the shoulder area, a benefit for my hubby who likes to lift weights and has a larger upper back region due to athletics. The sleeves are perfect as well, niether too short or too long.  This is a hip looking, and sexy jacket particularly for the over 40 crowd. It's classy and simply ""feels good on"" as he says.

positive,4.0,"These are a great pair of boots for the price. I ordered the gray leather look boots in a size 8.5, which is my normal size although sometimes it fluctuates with different brands. Upon opening the box I was impressed that these have a really nice color and texture to them, they look like they were more expensive boots. They fit my feet pretty well, and should be decently comfortable to wear. They felt a little narrow at the toe but I have kinda wide feet so that wasn't surprising. They might be uncomfortable for long periods of wear but I probably won't find out until fall/winter (it's 110 degrees where I live right now). I also have short legs so the boots come all the way up to my knee, the calf area is a tad wide but overall they fit pretty well considering I ordered them online. They look cute with my skinny jeans and I will definitely be wearing them come winter. The pictures that other people have uploaded are very accurate to how they look on me, they hit right below the knee and have a nice slouchy look.

Other people mentioned that they were really thin, but I didn't really notice that. I mean, ordering boots online for less than $50 what do you really expect? These are not heavy duty boots, they are just cute and fashionable. I always wear thick socks under my boots in the winter to keep my feet warm, as these boots are not lined heavily enough for warmth. Overall I am very happy with these boots, I like the style and the color, and the material is nice. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I still paid for the product and will wear them, I just received a promotional price in order to review them.",These are a great pair of boots for the price

positive,5.0,"Its true, this World's Greatest DAD Shirt, would make a great Father's Day or Birthday Gift, however I got it for my fiance simply because its true. What a nicer way for dad to know you appreciate him, and think his kiddos have the best dad ever! I love that it comes in so many color options, however black was my favorite option, as it is next ti impossible to stain. The shirt itself is very nice. Thick and seemingly well made. It came with a paper saying ""there is nothing wrong with this t-shit"" explaining the printing process and why the ink on the shirt may look ""weird."" I think it looks great though, and even though the ink may be a bit broken in places it gives it character and by no means takes away from the shirt. My fiance usually wears a 2xl but these days I have been noticing them getting a bit snugger on him, so I am glad I bought a 3xl because it fits him just right with a lil wiggle room. Sometimes plus size shirts are wider but not as long, causing belly to show, but these were just the right length. It felt a little scratchy at first, however after a wash it feels much better.

positive,4.0,"I would not wear these out of the house. They are very comfortable, but they are also a little see-through. The material itself is soft and very stretchy. It's also pretty thin. So thin in fact that I may have to come back to update this review if they don't last very long. Despite washing instructions, I just threw them in with the rest of my laundry. They have been washed in a regular cold cycle and then dried on the regular/high heat setting on the dryer. And so far they've held up pretty well. These are supposed to be capri style pants, but they are only a couple of inches from touching the floor when I wear them. I mean I am 5' 1 1/2'' but still.

positive,4.0,"My mom told me that I destroyed my first pair of shoes in no time, and I have wrecked every pair since. These are my second pair of merrel trail glove shoes. The first pair was the trail glove 2, and it was the best shoe I ever owned. While most shoes last no more than 4 months, sometimes 6, these shoes went 10 months before causing problems for me. The feel is closer to barefoot than any other shoe I have worn; I prefer them to vibrams because you can reasonably wear socks and they are more comfortable and I would say slightly more durable.

I have ran in these shoes, worked countless hours on a factory floor in them, and as a sending off after 11 months I wore them in a tough mudder. (If you're gonna wear these in a tough mudder you will be better off barefoot.) If you have feet that can handle hitting the ground under their own support like mine, i highly recommend them.

4 stars because this particular pair had a hard spot that gave me a small blister on my pinky toe before they were broken in, which rarely happens to my caveman feet. I cannot remember the last time a new show gave me a blister.",and it was the best shoe I ever owned

positive,5.0,"These are good quality shoe trees that adapt to the internal dimensions of the shoe.  The construction is solid and the cedar smell is very pleasant.  I have gotten into the habit of putting these into my shoes after a long day's work and they do indeed help my thinner leather shoes keep their shape.  They are also great for working with the shoes while polishing them.  The great thing about these particular trees is the adaptable toe for fitting into a variety of shoe styles, and the whole heel with handle for easy grip while using them or polishing your shoes.  If you have spent a lot of money on shoes and want to keep them fresh, then these are the go-to shoe trees.  Make sure you get the right size for the shoes they will be used with.  They should be firm in the shoe but not stretching out the leather but not too loose to make good contact with the leather.
UPDATE: Having now tried several brands of cedar shoe trees, I recommend these most highly due to the full heal construction, which puts even pressure across the heal and maintains the most natural shape.  Others with a smaller heal seem to distort the shape.",Quality Item

positive,5.0,"For this price point, you cannot go wrong.  I needed a simple analog watch for everyday wear but with my new job needing me to dress a little more professionally than I have had to in the past I thought that I would go for a watch with a more fashionable look to it.  After looking at all the Fossil and Citizen watches that met what I was looking for I noticed this Timex.  It had the same look to it, but was a heck of a lot less expensive so I figured that I would give it a try.

I was really impressed when it arrived, as it has very sleek styling and the satin metallic black finish looks just as fancy as the watches going for upwards of $200.  My wife has mentioned on several occasions that it looks great and we even stopped at the watch counter in Macy's to compare it to the more expensive watches, and it fits right in with them easily.

At first I thought that there was something wrong with the date marker as it didn't move ahead after midnight, but then after playing with it I realized that I needed for ""forward"" the watch through a full 24 hour cycle so that it would ""catch"" on the date dial moving the number up at midnight.

positive,4.0,This bracelet stand looks pretty nice on the top of my dresser. It holds quite a few bracelets and you can see them well to pick one out. I've wanted to put my bracelets out where I can see them for a while but didn't know how to do it. Braclets can take up alot of space if you put them in boxes and if you want to separate them to see them. This black velvet stand looks elegant and makes your braces look nice and they're all in one place so you can find them. Each rod easily comes off to remove the bracelet you want and you can easily set it back down into the stand. I purchase this product at a discount in return for an honest review. I'm enjoying it and it's working well for my bracelets. The only negative comment I have is it was not packaged very well in the box and the packaging it was holding it was torn. This didn't hurt the product at all but wouldn't have looked very good if it had been a gift.,Elegant bracelet holder

positive,4.0,"Great product. Very comfortable to wear. My only complaint is with the internal mesh pockets. It is very difficult to insert items as the corners get stuck in the mesh. It would be much better if the pockets were made of a thin sheet of material, allowing items like passports to be slid in easily. Using the RFID blocking sleeves makes the problem even worse.","Good, but could be better."

positive,4.0,"This backpack is great to take on trips and use a day pack, we just did so across Europe. It folds very small, in fact if it had a compression sack of some form, it could probably half as small as it does into it's own pocket. We've not experienced any issues with the material. It's not big, but we had two bottles of water, a rain-jacket, a sweater, a smaller camera and some other stuff in it without it sagging too much or being uncomfortable. The netting material on the straps is nice and we didn't sweat much wearing it.

Funny enough, in Portugal a department store was selling the exact same backpack, just not Eagle Creek branded and bright green for less than $10. So maybe shop around and see if it's available from a third-party before settling for this one.",Great solid day back for touring cities - but check pricing

positive,5.0,"Know why you want to order this hat?  Because you will not find any linen, ""ivy"" style cap as nice, or as accurately sized-fitted as this, from any online vendor operating in the US.

First, linen is far more difficult and costly to make than cotton-based fabrics.  The fiber it's made from is flax, and one of the few remaining regions in the world that still has a flax farming/manufacturing base large enough to manufacture large quantities of quality linen is ... guess where ... Poland and its surrounding areas/countries.

Second, I literally spent DAYS looking at the offerings of vendors all over the US trying to find a hat like this.  I ordered several, and had to return them all, mainly due to sizing issues.  I've got a big head, and I can never seem to find any caps that I like that quite fit me.  Even this vendor's largest size (XXL -- 62 cm) is right at the limit of the minimum for my head, which measures 61.5 cm.  One of the hats that I returned was SUPPOSEDLY an ""XXL,"" fitting up to 62 cm, but when I received it and measured the circumference of the band, it was actually just a little over 60 cm.  That cap wasn't constructed anywhere as nicely as this one, either.

I paid extra for expedited shipping on this one, and received it within one week of my order.  As I opened the box, I was just praying that it would fit, because this was my last chance to get the kind of cap I wanted to wear to an outdoor wedding ceremony in the coming week, and my time to find one was up.  When I pulled it out of the box and put it on my head, I practically wanted to cry ... it fit me PERFECTLY.  The quality/consistency of the linen is great, and craftsmanship/construction of the cap is very nice throughout.

In sum, I can't recommend this vendor/product highly enough.  Carefully measure your head; follow their instructions on sizing (e.g., if your head measurement falls between two sizes, order the slightly larger one), and you will be very happy.","Choose size carefully, and then buy with confidence!"

positive,4.0,"As an avid hiker I have tried a number of different sock options to ensure I do not get blisters.

This includes sock liners with regular socks. Sock liners with thicker wool socks, and wrightsocks.
For anything other than extreme cold weather I will typically use these. I do prefer the crew to the low cut socks, but I think that is more of a personal preference.
These socks are very convenient in that I don't have to wear 2 pairs of socks, and they do a fine job. I have had some pairs of these socks last over 2 years, and though they don't look extremely thick, they do last a long time.
If you are going to go on extremely long 10+ mile hikes, you may want to take a couple of pairs and swap them out. These socks do seem to be less effective if your feet become extremely sweaty, or if a lot of dirt and rocks are in your boots or shoes.

They are not perfect, but their are the best all in 1 sock solution to avoid blisters.",The best anti-blister sock solution

Lots of compartments in this thing and doesn't look or feel cheap at all. The pleather is soft and the snap on the outside works perfectly. My only reason for four stars instead of five is that some of the stitching (while it's still beautiful) is already coming unstitched in the back, and for having just taken out of the package, that seems disappointing.

I used to be a guy you see in the gray or tan T-shirt walking down the street. My wife couldn't figure out why my T-shirts were either tan or gray and asked me to loosen up and put some color in my life. I gave it some consideration and I decided maybe it was time for a change. Several years ago I began purchasing T-shirts in various colors. When I saw the rainbow of colors available from Next Level, I decided the royal blue and the Kelly green T-shirts were good colors for me. To date, I've worn a green shirt, I've washed it and still fits. The material has a good feel and it drapes well for my somewhat overweight body. I tree treat clothing items like shorts, T-shirts and pants as commodities and I look for the best value for my dollar.

positive,5.0,"These ""Dark Used"" jeans are 85% cotton,  13% polyester and 2% elastane.  The jeans come right up to one's hips. The fabric molds to one's body.  There is definitely some stretch to the material, which can make these warm in hot weather, but are comfortable while sitting down and standing. The jeans stretch out over the day and shrink back during the wash cycle.

These jeans fit snugly from waist to knees, then flair out some to the ankles.  No butt crack!  The dye has that ""used"" look in the thighs down to the knees, but is even across the butt and legs. Front pockets are small (3"" deep) but back pockets are deep enough for a normal wallet, 5"".

positive,5.0,"I can't say enough about how useful a shemagh can be in hotter climates.  I keep at least one of these handy in my camping/survival gear for many reasons:

- Keeps you cool when it is wet, either worn just around the neck or wrapped around your head
- Makes a great arm sling
- Can be used as a camp towel or wash rag
- Could be used as a tourniquet in an emergency
- Makes a great bandage wrap for a big wound
- Keeps the sun off your head/neck
- Can be used to pre-filter mucky water that you need to prep for drinking
- Partial head/neck camouflage
- Protects my neck during paintball play while keeping me cool

I keep finding more and more uses for this shemagh.  I now own 4 different colors.  They are easy to wash, and you just let them air dry.  Instructions say to machine wash cold on a delicate cycle or hand wash, and air dry only.  Wring it out, let it air dry for less than a half hour fully opened up, and it's dry and clean.",So many uses!

positive,5.0,"I bought my first pair of asics a few weeks ago and loved them, so came back to Amazon looking for a deal on similar.  Found this pair ""4E"" shoes on deep discount. I know I have wide feet, but I was skeptical about the 4E being too wide.  So I read up what Asics had to say about it, which was that the actual width may only vary by a milimeter or a few.  When I got these, I compared them to the ""normal"" pair I already had, and holding them tread to tread against each other, I could not see that the 4E was any wider at all.

For me this was great news because I wasn't really looking for a lot wider. So the information to share is this .. the ""wide"" actually comes more in the form of the cloth-like materials above the tread base.  I have very high arches, and on the ""normal"" shoes, the tongue bulges out and laces look liek they are covering a big gap.  On these 4E shoes, the shoes look normal, like they fit!  I now feel educated about what wide really means ... I will definitely be back for more!","... first pair of asics a few weeks ago and loved them, so came back to Amazon looking for ..."

positive,5.0,"I am used to the old fashioned kind of leather key holder that zips as this one does, but the keys had to be slipped under and through little key chain holders. It was very difficult to do, and one could lose some finger skin in the process. This Genuine Leather Key Chain Holder Coin Pocket #412CF is a bit larger than what I'm used to, and instead of getting right to work inserting the keys (as I am used to) I am sitting here trying to figure out how to open these larger key chains without breaking them off of the holders. Okay done. Do not order this key chain holder unless you first have a pair of needle nose pliers, a regular medium sized screw driver and some very strong fingers. I was able to open a few of the key chain holders with my fingers, but with some I absolutely needed pliers. If you should open the individual key holder too wide to close it, gently close the holder with the pliers until you have a snug fit. All this is actually as easy as I hoped it would be.  The Leather Key Chain Holder has been my preferred style for the last twenty years. The main problem is eventually the the small circular holders for the key chains will break out of the holding bar (that is attached to the leather across the top) These key chain holders would last a lot longer if one remembered to be gentle, every time you unzip the key chain holder to grasp an individual key and slowly insert your keys into your doors and other types of locks. This can be a hard thing to remember depending on what kind of day you are having! From experience I have learned to carry an extra set of keys on a small round key chain, just in case one of the keys happens to come lose without me realizing this. These appear to be solidly made so I would not expect any problems for at least a year or so. I am giving this the highest rating because, this is my type of key holder in style, plus I like the new wide key chain holders, that are easier to manipulate than they look, and you simply cannot beat the price!",Genuine Leather Key Chain Holder Coin Pocket #412CF is the key for comfort.

Previous review:
I have several pair of these boots and have never had a problem with putting them on until I received these. I have requested a return, but unfortunately a size larger is not available in this particular color (chestnut distressed).  The problem I had with these is that the shaft is so small around I cant get my feet down into them.  Hoping this is just a flaw on one pair of boots. I may try to order them in this same size in a few weeks. Will gladly change this review when I get a pair that fits. I love Bearpaw boots and have never been disappointed until today. Huge disappointment!",Shaft is WAY too small to get my foot into them.

positive,5.0,"I am 6'0"" and 165 lb with 33 size waist and bought two Red colors in M and one Super Blue in L size to compare and chooe one. There is a bigger than expected size difference between the M and L sizes. I usually opt for the large in many jackets and tops I buy because I have very broad shoulders but lean body, but in this case the Large was bulky. It is very wide cut especially around the waist. It depends on how you want it to fit; Just as a rain jacket, the large is fine with room for a sweater or sweatshirt when it's cold I would choose the large for hiking. The Medium fit just right, looks good even for a casual wear with not much room for a bulky sweater but can wear a sweatshirt or long sleeve T-shirt under it for warmth. Mind you, all pictures were taken while wearing a t-shirt only. Also there is definitely a slight but noticeable cut difference BETWEEN THE TWO MEDIUM sizes I purchased caused probably by period of production and slight design changes that accompanied it. For starters the Rocket Red fit me more nicely with a slightly more room around the shoulders and wider overall cut and the mesh was softer and more fine. overall more comfortable to wear. The Mountain Red was a little snug around the shoulders and sides and the mesh is definitely coarser on my arms which is fine, but since I have broad shoulders I chose the Rocket Red. The Mountain Red had a solid polyester fabric right below the collar where the Columbia tag is for durability, but the Rocket Red was soft mesh all the way to the edge of the collar. Also the mesh interior is more fine and softer on the Rocket Red than the  Mountain Red. Also the Blue one has fine soft mesh also and missing the collar solid polyester  fabric. I would bet the Rocket Red is a discontinued product since it's not offered on Columbia.com as well as many of the colors offered here on Amazon. So I can assume the colors here that are not offered on Columbia's website are probably discontinued and will have a softer mesh and fit a little bit more loose or classic fit. I guess Columbia upgraded it to make it more durable around the neck area and fit more modern a little bit. I would also like to add about one other review that said quality defect in one pocket being sewn all the way to the hem but not the other pocket(Left pocket), IT IS NOT A QUALITY ISSUE, that pocket is where you pack the jacket. it has a two sided zipper, so you can turn the pocket inside out and pack the whole jacket inside, so it's intentionally sewn that way. All the three jackets I got where sewn like that. It will have a patch near the zipper pocket that says PACKABLE. Overall really nice quality jacket as to be expected from Columbia, and a steal on these prices, in stores it usually is  twice.",Tackle Rainy Days in Style with this Lightweight Comfy Jacket from Columbia

The black cat part feels thicker and higher quality than the nude tights part, which seem a little thin and needs more care while stretching. When I first got the tights, the merge between the black cat ears and the nude colored thigh section was already strange as there seemed to be some black not belonging to the cat ears on the nude section. After wearing this for a day outfit 5-6 times, the line between the black cat ears and the nude tights has begun to fray, and the soles and ankles of the feet have begun pilling.

positive,4.0,"After buying different brands of sized 36-inch waist pants, there seemed to be much variation in brand fitment.  I went with the 38-inch waist Haggar because several brands at 36-inch were too tight.  The Haggar seems to be a quality pant, but 38-inch waist seems to be on the large side for my fit, I probably would have liked a 36-inch waist in the Haggar brand.  That said, it seems other reviewers seem to find the length of the crotch to hip on the short side, and with this I tend to agree, making a 38-inch the better choice for my build.  The length of the 34-inch inseam is very generous, I'll probably need them hemmed.

positive,5.0,"Love that Crocs have finally come around to making attractive, non-""orthopedic"" looking shoes in the last few years. This style is even cuter in person/on.  Seems impossible, but they are even lighter than ""original"" Crocs.

You can actually use them as a stuff sack, if you zip up the one size and place them on end. When stuffed completely full, I was still worried that the fabric or the seams would rip, since it is so thin.

positive,4.0,"These shoes are both stylish and functional. I use them for both lifting and roadwork, and they have held up for going on 5 months. The inside of the sole peeled pretty quickly after I started wearing them, but this is not a major problem.

Edit: I usually untie these shoes when putting them on/off. Today, I made the mistake of trying to don these while they were loosely tied. I crushed the back (this is the first pair of shoes where this has ever happened). After 5 or so minutes of tugging, it popped back into place and now works just the same as before. However, just a warning, don't use these as slip-ons.",Good Shoe

Overall I have used these nearly every day and love them when outside on a breezy/windy day.  Sure, the lower 1/3 to 1/2 may still flop around but that's acceptable to me.  However, I have a few ties that no longer have a complete tag loop on the back to allow these tie stays to work so I am also going to get a traditional tie clip preferablly a magnetic one.

They are just a tiny bit big on me, but not enough to make them uncomfortable or slip off. It's actually kind of nice that their a teeny bit big because my heal doesn't rub up against the back.

It looks rich and the color is perfect ( the color in the photo matches the color of the bag).  It says it is leather but it doesn't have that ""leather smell.""  I question that but it does look like leather.  It has a different smell to it but it's not bad and it went away in a short time.  It may be the shipping wrap that they use.  It still does not smell like leather though.  What I really like is the lining.  It appears to be satin and it is sewn in very tightly and does not hang loose when I'm digging in the bag for something.  I love that!  There is plenty of room for just about anything you would want to carry.  I don't really need the extra long strap since the shorter strap is plenty long to go over my should and can be adjusted in length.  If you love hobo bags you will love this one!",Very nice hobo bag!

positive,4.0,"My boyfriend absolutely LOVES this ring. The design is so awesome and intricate. I gave it 4 stars because it's not exactly scratch resistant.. My boyfriend scraped it really bad after the first time going to the gym and picking up weights so as a result, he takes his ring off every time he's at the gym. Also, go half a size smaller than you expect. The overly smooth surface makes it really easy to slip off when in contact with water. It's pretty inconvenient that not only does my boyfriend have to take it off at the gym, but now also when he washes his hands or takes a shower just so he doesn't lose it. He doesn't complain though and says he wants his wedding ring to be modeled after this exact ring. He's happy; that's what counts most I suppose.",Not scratch resistant..

I wear a size 18/20, for reference. I ordered size 2x and they are perfect.  I also have found them to be very wearable at work without being costumey because it's only a 2-layer crinoline, unlike many of the 5-layer fluffier ones you can buy.

I was going to give it to the thrift store, but never got around to is.  Which was fortunate, because my next costume - I HATE costumes! - was as a little old lady from ""Arsenic and Old Lace,"" so I plopped it onto my white hair and it worked great, again.

They don't rub me anywhere, and the heel height compared to the platform height makes them easy to walk in all day.  Plus, I got several compliments on them.

These were the perfect choice. The gray/brown combo goes with everything and I like that they don't have a lot of fluffy fur like so many boots I looked at. The fit is shoe-like, not heavy or clunky, but there's still room for heavy wool socks when needed. I can comfortably tuck in regular or skinny jeans too. I was a little nervous about lace-up boots, but the speed laces at the top make them fairly easy to take on and off. **Update: Still loving these boots after two seasons of wear.

They do feel pretty soft, though. Only one thing is iffy about these...it looks like there might be some thread ends that may unravel around the knees, but I'm not sure yet if this will pose a problem, so I won't take off a star for it.

The white lightweight blend poplin has slate blue substantial stripes which contrast well, giving it a very crisp impression.  The collar is a little more dressy than a button down, and with the enclosed removable plastic collar stays to keep the fabric put, it can be worn with or without a necktie.  Having a rounded cuff keeps the fabric from fraying as easily as otherwise, and it is closed by using a single button.  There are two on the cuff, so you have the ability to have it looser or tighter.  All stitching was done well and the bottom side seams have a nice little curved piece of fabric sewn in.

I like very much that the bottom button is stitched in blue thread and its buttonhole is also in blue.  This is a cute accent that seems almost like a secret.  The fit is average and because the fabric is thin and white, if you are shy, it's probably smart to wear a t-shirt underneath.  It is a great shirt for hot climates.  This is a very nice shirt and well worth the cost.","Ignore the picture, it's much more attractive in person"

Let's see...
I see a lot questions and comments regarding the manufacturing of Manitobah Mukluk (MM) products. Just FYI, like any high output manufacturer, MM does outsource. Specifically, in MM's case, to China. And some of the components are sourced from Australia. That said, yes, some of their products are still made exclusively in Canada as well.
You can check MM's website and the styles that are 100% Canadian made have a red maple leaf on their listing to signify as much.
Either way, the Manitobah Mukluk website clearly states ""International Production"" on the products that applies to. Nothing tricky or deceptive.

Now, on to the boots. *sigh* '
The design is just my style. Before I first purchased a pair of these many, many years ago, I was so excited for them to arrive that I was showing the pictures of my anticipated purchase to everyone.
No one seemed to think much of them. And some people even said they thought they were ugly.
That is, until they saw these babies on my feet in person!! LoL
Everything about them is great in my opinion. I love that there are no laces or zippers. I just slide my foot in or out of them with no hassles. The structure of the shaft and the leather are sturdy enough that the boots don't slouch excessively. Manitoba Mukluks are the type of boots that look great on skinny legs; at the same time, are wide enough to fit and look even better on big[ger] calves. '
Beautiful quality leather; very thick yet supple. The color is vibrant. The etched detail/design is lovely but not overbearing.
The lining in the shaft is faux fur. The footbed is plush, non-removable, natural shearling and does get worn down but it's a quick and easy fix to order new shearling liners and slip them on top of the existing footbeds when need be. The Vibram soles are the absolute best. Flexible and they move naturally with the movement of your foot. Not restrictive at all. It's like being barefoot without the nuisance of feeling the objects underfoot that would otherwise be sharp or painful if you actually were. Do be advised, though, that if you require arch support, you'll need to purchase accordingly because these are completely flat. Luckily, I don't have any issue of that nature and these are, by far, the warmest and most comfortable shoes I own. So much so, I have 3 pairs in varying colors. ' ' ' And I always have my eye out for new pairs. I'd wear them everyday if I could.
I've worn them in snow in the dead of winter. I've strolled in them in the rain. They have definitely held up in all types of weather. I've heard people say that these, like any inclement weather shoes, should be waterproofed with a silicon--or a similar--all weather spray. But I've never done that. And my feet have never been cold or wet in these boots. Ever. ' To their credit, these boots have held up for years. Soles, leather and all. To this day, I get compliments and stares every time I wear them--which is often. LoL

What else can I say? Oh! Sizing: I have an annoying pair of feet. Narrow, bony, almost always cold...not to mention the killer bunion on my right foot (which, mind you, never hurts when I'm wearing these boots!!! '). I'm somewhere between a size 8 and an 8.5 in most shoes. So I usually purchase an 8.5 to be on the safe side.
The first pair of Manitobah Mukluks I purchased with the Vibram soles was a size 7 since everyone kept emphasizing that these run large and should be ordered down a full size. Even the MM website says that.
Upon arrival, my big toe was so close at the front of each shoe that it was visible to others that they were pushing at the toe of the boots.
However, I kept them because at the time I ordered, there were no size 8s available and I didn't want to wait for them to come back in stock (who knows when that would have been, if ever). Plus, I didn't want to risk them being way more expensive than what I'd paid for the 7s.
Over time, the leather did stretch and the boots fit like a glove now.
That said, the next 2 pairs of MM I ordered are 8s. And those seem to simply have...""softened up"" over time, as opposed to stretching to accommodate my foot. I, personally, wouldn't order these in a 7 again. So, my suggestion: if you're juuuuust over a size or at a half size; don't go a full shoe size down when buying these.

That's all I can think to say about these at the moment. But I'll definitely update if anything else comes to mind. Oh, no; I know. One more thing.
If you're on the fence about purchasing these or debating paying so much for a pair of boots: GO FOR IT!!! They're so worth it. You won't be disappointed.",These

positive,4.0,"These pants are very cute.  They are a little too small for me but then, I'm an adult who is small enough to fit in XL girls sizes much of the time, so I tried them.  They do fit, and are fairly comfortable.... but I would suggest ordering the largest size you can, so that they will stretch less when wearing...because when these pants stretch, some of the color is lost a little in the flowers and the background.  When the material stretches, you can see a whiter part of the material in the weave of the fabric a little more... It is not very noticeable... but essentially the colors will dull some the more these pants stretch... so for more vibrant pants... I would suggest ordering up in size.  Then the pants will last longer also for growing children, who for sure will not be happy about growing out of these pants!",Cute pants... consider ordering up in size....

This purse is a perfect size and has so much room!  I had trouble trying to visualize the size of it when I was debating whether to buy it, so I took a picture of of it next to a regular 16.9 oz water bottle for size reference.  The water bottle will fit in the largest part of the purse and you can still zip it, but the water bottle would need to be at an angle, and I'm not sure there would be room for anything else in that compartment.

I love that there are so many zippered pockets on the outside to make for easy access for me.

I was nervous, as I saw some reviews mentioning receiving a product with a strong chemical smell.  Mine is perfect and smells like leather, but not overpoweringly so.  The seller that I went through was Vine Branch. Prompt shipping and prime eligible.  The color is gorgeous (I got the burgundy), and the strap is adjustable but can be set to be pretty long if you want it for a cross body, or shorter for an over the shoulder purse.  I wanted it to sit just at hip level when wearing it cross body, and it is long enough that it could be even lower than that.  The strap is thin and not obtrusive, yet sturdy.  The only negative thing, which is not a big deal to me at all, is that the material on the inside seems cheap and thin.  I'm not going to try to tear it to test it, lol, but it seems like it could tear if you had something sharp in there.  Just a guess though, I could certainly be wrong, and it's not something that you see anyway.  Overall I am extremely pleased with this product.  I don't even want to say that it is such a great item for the price, because I would compare it to much more expensive items and still say it is a great product!","Spacious for a small purse, looks much more expensive! Nice leather smell."

positive,5.0,"I purchased this Incantasia the Glamour Witch costume for my 6.5 year-old and she loves it! I was looking for a good quality witch's dress because I wasn't impressed by the witch's costumes sold at some of the local retailers (the material was too flimsy, barely held up, and looked really cheap).

In contrast, this Incantasia costume not only looks beautiful but feels luxurious too. The material is soft and the purple inner lining is a great touch, not only aesthetically but also to provide some form of insulation. After all, by the time Halloween comes around, the weather might get a tad cold. The dress also has an attached belt which can be adjusted with a beautiful jewel brooch in the middle. The witch's hat also feels sturdier than most of the witch's hats I've seen at local retailers. It fit my daughter's head perfectly and is made in such a way as to be able to accommodate larger heads (since it states the size is for 6-8).

My daughter is about 50 lbs, and is about 46 inches tall and this dress fit her quite well, except for the collar which was a bit loose and there was a little room in the waist too. This is one of the most beautiful, well-made Halloween costumes we've purchased, and I'll definitely be checking out the manufacturer's other costumes for next Halloween!",Great quality and looks gorgeous!

positive,5.0,"Really awesome product. Although we've only used it once so far, it was a breeze adjusting and putting on my son. Some Pro's and Con's..

Pros:
- Very professional and attractive packaging.
-Liked the idea of a product that could be registered for warranty
-adorable design/pattern
-Nice material
-Company seems to take much pride in their product
-The ""for best results"" and ""for worst results"" instructions on the tag for washing was a cute and humorous addition

Cons:
- I didn't like that the rivets on the inside were all the way through both layers of material. I feel as though that would get annoying or even painful on baby's skin. I read in a review somewhere that the newer version has the rivets through only the first layer of material so they don't rub on baby's skin, but that wasn't the case for the item I received, and I was under the impression that I was purchasing whatever model was up-to-date for this product.
- Says it fits 8-36 pounds, however my son is 3.5 months old, and although he's huge for his age, he's 17.5 pounds and on the last set of snaps for width adjustment, and the middle setting for rise adjustment. This is a disappointment, as it won't last longer than this summer.","Great product, some flaws"

positive,5.0,"Cons: sole is slippery and, as others have said, it is made of fabric like material not rubber. It wears off in threads. Weird. Probably less expensive to make. They are pretty costly.

It's completely therapeutic. Even though they cost a lot I figure my feet are worth it. Will buy another pair for sure. Love the leopard design.

On fit: I wear a size 8.5 tennis shoe and found the 7-8 size fit perfectly on my feet. I like my sandals to fit my feet exactly the size they are. I trip if they are longer. Width perfect and decent arch support. Toe spreaders are a comfortable padded cloth.",Happy Toes

UPDATE Dec 20, 2015
I had to update this review.  in regards to the lacing system, mine came with regular laces and not the quick lace system everyone is whining about.  I would've replaced the laces with regular laces anyway.  I've had these boots for a couple of months now and I must say, these are fantastic.  I've taken them on weekend hikes and most recently, to El Yunque rainforest in Puerto Rico where they performed flawlessly.  They were comfortable all around, great ankle support, waterproof as heck, and took everything the forest threw at it.  They have very good grip but there were some cases in the forest where these didn't help with traction(to be fair nothing would've lol).  But that wasn't a deal breaker at all.  i was dreading the 2 hour hike back downhill but the heel part of the boots finally made sense.  It gave you better control and support and put less stress on your knees which was great.  Highly recommend these and after i go through them i will most certainly without a doubt get another pair.  And so now we face the winter and will update on my winter hikes with these.  Cheers!",GET THESE BOOTS!

positive,5.0,First and foremost this is a juniors size jacket. Juniors comes after children sizes and then there are woman's sizes. So I bought this for my 10 year old daughter that wears true to her size of 10/12 in large children shirts. I bought a small because everyone said it runs small. Well it fits like a size 14 in girls. Which is what a small in juniors is. So the sizing is actually accurate. The tag even says a s 14. She loves it. It is rather thin but we live in California so hopefully it won't be a problem.,Buyer please read. Junior sizes. Junior comes after children sizes.

positive,4.0,"I bought this to wear in Vegas for halloween.  I love the way this costume looks, but there was a fixable fit issue.  The costume is cute, it fits well through the bodice and the skirt hits right below my butt so that my entire butt is covered (although I did buy a short petticoat to wear under the skirt for some extra fit and coverage).  I have a longer torso and had tried on some other Halloween costumes that didn't cover my butt at all.  This one at least covers it, but I certainly won't be bending over in this out in public.  The main fit issue that I had was that there was way too much material in the bust.  I am a 34 C and I felt like my boobs were lost in all the extra fabric.  For a quick fix day of Halloween I pulled down and tucked the extra white fabric into the top of the black bodice piece and pinned it into place.  I eventually would like to sew it in, but haven't gotten around to it yet.  My only other problem with the costume is that it arrived extremely wrinkled.  Both the cape and the skirt were extremely wrinkled and both say that they can't be ironed.  I tried ironing the costume through another piece of fabric and it just barely helped.  I wish there was another way to iron the costume.  Other than those two minor issues, I'm still pretty happy with the overall look of the costume.","Love the Look, Had to Adjust the Fit"

positive,4.0,"Just got this a couple days ago.  Every time my wife flies back to her hometown, it's hit or miss whether her large suitcase will be over or under the 50 lb. weight limit.  This should help, although I haven't tried it yet with a loaded suitcase.

I also had an ulterior motive for purchasing this.  I play, and have several, bass guitars.  Whenever I buy or sell one, the first question usually asked is, ""How much does it weigh?""  Now I'll have a pretty fair estimate.  I weighed my basses this morning, and this scale appears to be pretty accurate.  My only concern is that because there isn't anything on the bass itself to hook onto the hanger part of the scale, I weighed them with the straps on.  But when I tried to weigh one of the straps by itself to see how much weight it added to the total weight of the bass, it isn't heavy enough to register on the scale.  So I'll probably just deduct one ounce from the weight I get of the bass with the strap on.

It does appear to be more accurate with heavier objects like a suitcase.  So all-in-all, I'm glad I got this.  It should be very helpful when flying.",Handy Little Helper

It feels well made when you hold it, its got a nice weight to it, and unlike other bargain-priced handbags, it stands on its own and feel sturdy. Before purchasing, I read some of the comments about how it was hard to get into, and yes - the top zip makes the opening a little smaller than it actually is, but it's not an issue at all. I'm planning on buying another in a different color. I purchased the dark pewter, and from the pics it seemed like it would be more gray, and in reality its more bronze than pewter. Still a great looking bag though -",Great bag - color is a little off from photos

positive,5.0,Ill be darned if these no show socks don't stay in place.  The first ever I have used that are so small and yet so reliable.  They have a very clever non slip pad on the back of the heal that keeps them nicely in place.  And they are comfortable.  So if you are looking for something that covers to the low back of your heal these are the real deal.  Of note don't get them expecting them to give any friction protection at the top back of the shoe - they are truly no show and don't reach that far up the heal.,They really stay in place

positive,5.0,"Bought a black Zenana v-neck t-shirt from a Marshall's several years ago and have been slowly wearing it to death. I was super excited to find that I could buy it in a 4-pack, and for a totally reasonable price. The cut is nice and long, it has a good amount of stretch to it and keeps its form beautifully over time, the material is the perfect balance between too heavy and totally see-through, and the neckline is low enough to be interesting without being TOO low. It's even nice enough to dress up for work, but still totally great with jeans and sneakers. Seriously, favorite shirt. :)",My favorite shirt.

positive,4.0,"Ordered these in an 8-1/2 for my mom who wears an 8-1/2 or 9.  They are very nice slippers and seem to be good quality and well made, but they were much too large for her ... at least 1/2 a size too large (could fit an entire finger behind the heel.)  I have returned them and the vendor promptly issued a refund (which I appreciate.)  However, it cost over $12 to return ship these slippers (about half of the entire cost) and, in addition, this vendor charges a 20% restocking fee, so I definitely lost money on this purchase (and she still has no slippers.)  I rated these four out of five stars because the slippers seem to be a good product.  Received them fairly quickly and the vendor promptly refunded my purchase (even before receiving the slippers back), but I am not a fan of restocking fees and actually would have just liked to exchange them for a smaller size.  I would rate the vendor slightly less than four stars.",Runs Large

But on line the sizes for me are 9.5 D(M) US and that was a good guess on my part.

She was super excited to try it on and didn't want to take it off!",Perfect!

positive,5.0,"These arrived, I put them on, and went straight out on a run. They are excellent running shoes, good looking, and as a tend to put weight on the sides of my feet, made me feel as if I had finally arrived in the best shoe for me. Asics just earned a 40 year Nike customer, even my knees felt great. I have been running since before running shoes were invented, and these are hands down the best shoes I have ever put on. I hope they last the hundreds if miles I will put on them, but that is another review.",They are excellent running shoes
positive,5.0,"I love this dress! Great fit, great quality and so pretty!",Perfect for little girls!
positive,5.0,"I ordered a large and it fits fine. A little snug for my preference but that's a personal preference. Most would find
The fit is as it should be. If I lose 3-5 more lbs will fit to my liking. Order according to your true size. I wear 12. Usually order 12-14",True to size; looks like picture. Nice light material
positive,4.0,"The Amazon Collection offers this pretty 18k gold (over rhodium) multi-gemstone bracelet seven and a half inches long. Pretty, but a bit snug on the average ladies wrist this bracelet holds quite an assortment of pretty mineral samples like: topaz, amethyst, peridot, garnet, citrine & white topaz. As to the ultimate design of the piece, the stones are firmly set w/ 4 prongs onto the bracelet, while I wasn't thrilled by the bracket's closing-clasp, it's not over user-friendly, but if your lady doesn't  mind calling in an extra pair of hands (I.e. YOU) while putting on your jewelry it goes on fine. Overall we liked it, for the price and the quality of materials it's alright.",A nice wrist parade of minerals for your lady
positive,4.0,"Got these as a gift for my 10yo niece. The looked nice and were the perfect size. I had to repackage them to gift them because they came in individual plastic bags placed in a drawstring bag- I put them in a box with cotton. I can't review how they feel in the ears or whether they caused any sensitivity- I will update if my niece has any comments or concerns. They open and close easily but securely. Overall I was very happy with the,- especially for the price.",Perfect for a young girl
positive,5.0,"The shorts are what I expected, given past experience with carhartt.  The other reviewer was right about it being long enough for tall guys.  I am pretty tall, and the length is perfect in that it covers my legs all the way to the knees, but not below.  I carry a limited number of tools, and a telephone, and constantly get in and out of a vehicle, for my job and these have very well designed pockets for carrying a few hand tools, out of the way so they don't stab the truck seat.  The truly unique and excellent features of carhartt are attention to detail, and sparing no expense for quality.  However, I hope I haven't spoken too soon, as we shall see how long they last.",good so far
positive,5.0,These are great for summer & exactly what I was looking for!!,Perfection.
positive,5.0,Better than expected.. Grandson loved!!!,Super Cute!!!
positive,5.0,"These little pants are plenty long enough, but I was worried that they would be too tight in the waist since he is a little chunky (25lbs @ 9 mos, breast fed). The elastic is narrow & not to strong ( tightly woven) so elastic is quite forgiving, enough to get him through the winter in NC mtns. He looks adorable in them! ( of course!) The material is cotton, soft, not too thick, but enough to keep his little chunky legs warm","Very cute, soft, warm"
positive,5.0,"just love this skirt..the way it flows,, feels, fits! Perfect! washes well when hung to dry. can wear it to work, then change top for something mare dressy to go out in. well made, comfy, durable..highly recommend. great price too.",fantasic
positive,5.0,Love them and got lots of compliments. easiest heals to walk in!,Five Stars
positive,4.0,"This suit is SUPER cute and way better quality than I expected, considering how inexpensive it was. It fits well, and the top is snug enough that you could wear it as a bandeau (the straps are removable) without it failing on you. The bottoms are rouched on the sides, which gives it a bit of flair & forgiveness. While the bottoms come up as high as in the picture, I was *slighty* disappointed that the top is not as long as it appears in the picture. That being said, it's still a great top & one that I can easily mix & match with other bottoms. Again, for the price, totally exceeded expectations (which is even higher praise since no one likes bathing suit shopping)!

Note: I also originally posted a picture of the bathing suit - similar to all the others on here - with my review, but Amazon deemed it somehow, outside of their review guidelines.",Fantastic buy; can't beat the price!
positive,4.0,I like them a lot. Very comfortable and fit grest.,Four Stars
positive,5.0,These are the best for running around in the house during winter.,Five Stars
positive,5.0,"While I ordered this light pink shoe I received a darker pink shoe in a different style.  I was disappointed as they were supposed to match our daughter's Easter dress, but it was a surprise gift, and she absolutely loves them.  These are very well made, and as we have 3 girls and I expect them to last.  Bought my other daughter some purple ones at the same time and received the correct item.","Wrong item shipped, but she loved them"
positive,4.0,"Love my robe. I only had issues with the tag behind my neck. I had to cut it out because it scratches but other than that, love the robe",Love my robe
positive,5.0,"These attractive open-filigree silver dome earrings are hollow so although they are a relatively large 1/2 inch in diameter, they are light in weight and comfortable to wear all day long. They are nicely finished with no rough edges.

The posts are a generous 1/2 inch in length, are securely attached and the post length should be a good fit for most ear lobes. These are a classic style that should not go in and out of fashion and they look good dressed-up and dressed-down. Small size metal earring backs are included along with a sturdy gift box.",Sterling Silver Oxidized Open-Filigree Dome Earrings
positive,5.0,Cute and versatile. Great fit. Comfortable for high heels. Easy to walk in.,Nice shoes
positive,4.0,"Really like the fit it I'd very flattering for tall people with a large midsection as well as pregnant people..not a fan of the diagonal pocket on the left hand side though. Overall it is great though....I wear 3x-4x and it gives me some shape rather than being a box, I also have a longer body so I love maternity clothes they just fit better!",really like them!
positive,4.0,"Very attractive and solidly constructed.  A little narrow toward the toes and might need a little more support and padding at the heels, but otherwise quite satisfactory.  These are probably the best reasonably price slipper of its type available.",These are probably the best reasonably price slipper of its type available
positive,5.0,"Napoleon has a cameo appearance in our theatre production and I opted for the Elope Napoleon Hat over cheaper alternatives, and I'm very glad I did. The hat is substantial, not flimsy, and is generously sized to fit an adult's head. Too often I've purchased cheap costume hats and found them to be too small to be useful.

The hat is actually a tricorne turned around, not the traditional Napoleon bicorn, but I see that as a plus. If needed, it can be turned around and used for George Washington or a British Naval Officer or the like.",Super costume hat!!
positive,5.0,Great light weight beach/workout tank,Five Stars
