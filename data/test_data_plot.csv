negative,1.0,"I bought this with the intention of wearing it out the day of receiving it. However, it arrived later than promised so that was a fail. Nevertheless, I decided to wear it a couple of days ago (Saturday, July 1, 2017) for an outdoor festival. When I first got the earrings, the latches tightly enclosed the straight post in, securing it. At first, it was hard to push the latch upwards to put the earring on me. But I thought to myself that's a good thing... because if it is hard to remove the post, it should stay on me for good right?...... WRONGGGGGGGG! When I was out, one of the earrings (the one on my right ear) kept falling off over and over again. It was at the point that people were asking me ""why does your earring keep falling off?"" I would have to repeatedly pick it up from the grass, put it on my ear, and snap the post back into the latch. I probably had to put it back in every 20 minutes or so. After 2 hours of being at the festival, I finally gave up, took both earrings off, and tucked them into my purse. It has been less than 48 hours (or 2 full days) since I took the earrings out of the box. They both are changing colors! At first I thought only the right one was switching colors because it kept being exposed to the grass. But both of them are switching back to their original metallic color (due to general exposure to air). I included several pictures to show the latch difference between the ""good"" earring and the ""bad"" one. I also display the color morphology (I tried to use my fingers to point at specific locations in some pictures).  As for the other physical characteristics of the earrings, I purposely bought this because it was the biggest hoop shaped bamboo earrings I could find on Amazon Prime with ""positive"" reviews. I was so inspired by Rihanna's earrings in the music video for ""Wild Thoughts"" that I wanted something big and bulky. I was disappointed to see these earrings were very flat when looking at them dead on from an angle not shown in their advertised pictures. In addition, it wasn't as big as I was aiming for (but I knew this when I read 3.5"" in the description. I never plan on buying earrings from this vendor (until they learn how to stop being so cheap with whatever airbrush/spray paint they use on their products.

negative,2.0,"I own 10 watches: mostly automatic self wind watches and a couple quartz watches--some ""tool"" watches and a few ""fashion"" watches.  This is a rather looking (we'll get to working later) nice fashion watch.

It's an automatic self wind model, which is to say that springs applying pressure to gears and other mechanical bits keep this puppy going, and those springs are driven by the watch moving (and by extension your arm moving).  I tend to prefer these types of watches both for the magical intricacy that goes into making these things and a sweeping second hand they tend to have.  They don't tend to be the best at keeping time, though it's not impossible (my Tissot and Orient watches are + 3 seconds a day) to stay close to accurate.  This particular model isn't quite as accurate in initial testing.  I say that, but I can't tell.  It just stops (even when you can see the spring is rather well wound).  I have a Lucien Piccard pocket watch, which is within 1-2 seconds a day (not bad for a hand wound pocket watch!), and it's been working well for years.  Let's hope my experience with this wrist watch is an outlier.  The inner bits are called a ""movement"", and in general if it's Swiss or Japanese, it's advertised.  The silence in the description and on the watch face speaks volumes, so I assume it's Chinese.  That's not entirely bad (if it works, which this doesn't), as many of the Chinese movements are legal (not licensed, but the patents have expired) copies of time tested (literally) Swiss designs.  The fit and finish can vary (I cannot really tell with this particular watch with the limited view), but they tend to work as this model does, reasonably accurate, and they can be durable enough).  Anyway, don't expect to pull this watch out of a drawer or box after not wearing it for a couple days and just have it work.  You'll need to wear it a bit and then set it.  I haven't tested the reserve (the ability to stay wound enough to keep time), but I suppose 36-42 hours is reasonable (for a full wind down, and often it doesn't get put away fully wound, so expect less).  As I noted, I have 10 watches, so I tend to rotate these in and out, so I'm used this issue, but folks coming from quartz may want to consider it.  Sadly this one dies after a couple hours, even while being actively worn.

As for the looks (this is a fashion watch), I really like it.  Rose gold is definitely popular now, and this pulls it off (it's ion plated stainless) rather well.  The look is a bit oversized though trying to be understated (in terms of embellishment) with a chiseled look that looks better in person, though pales in comparison to the lines of watches that cost 10-30x the price (not a real complaint given the cost difference).  The band is the weak link, as it is with so many other watches in this price range.  A top notch band can cost more than the whole watch does here, but upgrades can be found from $20+.  For now it'll do.  It's not horrible, but it's a bit stiff and thick.  It's stitched and certainly doesn't deteriorate the look.  It's just hard to put on and doesn't exude luxury.

All in all, this watch could be a keeper and a fine gift (the box is nice enough if it worked.  Depending on the recipient, a Orient or Seiko may be a better choice, as they offer some of the most accurate and durable watches in the same price range, but they don't quite offer this look nor do they have dressy watches in this size.  They do tend to work, so they have that going for them!

I'll be returning this in one form or another (either try my luck with warranty or send back to Amazon).  I guess is that it's actually over lubricated in the wrong places, which can gunk it up.  That would explain it needing a 100% wound spring to even move and any less causes it to stop as well as the odd behavior where one or both hands didn't want to move, causing only the hour hand or only the minute hand to move when try to set.","It could be a nice watch that makes a fine gift, but my copy doesn't work."

There were at least 3 areas where large piles of thread were tangled and stitched into the garment.  It looked very bad.  I couldn't wear the product and shipping to return it was outrageous, as it was from an overseas vendor.  I contacted the vendor and asked to return the items, but they informed me that I would have to pay shipping.  It would have been way more than the cost of the items I had ordered.  The vendor then offered to give me a $5 refund, which I took because it was better than nothing.  Additionally, the vendor requested that I not post any negative reviews of the product, which I thought was silly.

negative,1.0,"I agree with some fellow reviewers. I ordered this shoe a half size smaller based on other reviews I had read. The half size down made this shoe for more like the series 1 version, which I had been running in for two years. I decided my series 1 shoes were starting to run a little thin on the soles of the shoe. Outside of that, I plan to continue to run in my series 1 shoe until they truly wear out.

The toe box of this shoe is definitely wider and the fit around the middle of the foot is wider, too. I loved the more minimal feel of the series 1 version better. They added padding and arch support to this shoe and it is too much. However, after my second run in this series shoe, the arch support has worn down, luckily. I am relatively flat footed, so I do not want the padding and support. The heel of this shoe definitely has more slip, but I am breaking them in wearing socks due to cold temperatures, which feels as though it is better because of the slipping of the heel.

Overall, I will never run in any other shoe. I am of the opinion that if it isn't broken, don't fix it and the ""improvements"" to this shoe were not necessary or needed. I believe that once I have been running in them for a while and the padding starts to wear down that it will be more like the series 1 version of this shoe.

Update: I tried really, really hard to learn to love these shoes. The ""improvements"" to the shoes have made it so I am not able to run in them. The heel will rub if you do not have socks on. It is too rigid and will not break in any further, no matter how many miles you put on them. The arch support is too much. I like the amount of padding these have on the sole. Other than that, if you loved the first generation of this shoe, do not even bother to order this one. I have ordered and plan to try Merrell's Bare Access Arc 4 shoe and hope to have better luck with those.",The half size down made this shoe for more like the series 1 version

negative,1.0,"Disappointed by this item:

1) I ordered an 18 Month size for my 12 month-old granddaughter. After washing on cold and drying on low, it barely was long enough to snap at the bottom.

3) It's certainly not ""baby fine jersey"". It is rough, and I have my doubts as to whether it is indeed 100% cotton. The above-mentioned grandchild has eczema, and cannot tolerate material like this next to her skin.

negative,2.0,"I bought this to replace a black Aisling bag that I loved. I had the black one for about a year, then the top zipper started to be a problem. The fabric near the zipper, at the curved area, started to tear, which then made the zipper catch in the loose fabric. The bag is still in great condition, but can't be used now. The Kipling warranty is one year, and I am just over the year. I'm not sure if it would cover this zipper issue. I was reluctant to replace it with the same style, but I took a chance and ordered another Aisling. The photos don't show the curved ends, so I thought maybe Kipling had modified the zipper. The new one I ordered has the same curved end on the zipper, so I'm not sure if I will keep it. I may switch to the Angie, which is slightly smaller but has a straight zipper across the top.

At first, I thought they were awesome out of the package. They had like a suede leather smell and feel and exceeded my expectations in detail. Then I tried to put them on.

I used the size chart provided and ordered bigger than I needed as per the reviews. I don't know who sizes these things, but it's so far off I don't even know where to begin. I couldn't even get them over my calf and upon looking down while sliding them on, I noticed problem #2.

There was a 3"" rip in the seat of the pants. I didn't even get the things up my legs so, it's not even like I sat down or squatted and ripped them. Upon looking more at the packaging, it looks like the bag was well used or had been sitting on the bottom shelf and move around a number of times at a warehouse. I'm not sure if they were actually used or what, but they had to go back. There's no sewing up this material and if there's already a rip in them already, who knows how much more they're going to split by the time I was done with my trip.

negative,2.0,"First of all, the bodice was yellow.  Not beige or off-white or vanilla.  It's Yellow.  Banana yellow. For that reason alone, I returned it.

The costume itself isn't terrible.  (As long as you look great in yellow.)  The bottom skirt was huge.  I mean huge! I am a solid 14-16 so ordered extra large.  The elastic around the waist did not hold the skirt up and when I walked, even with the upper skirting and brown belt-cincher (I will talk about that next),  the skirt slipped down to the degree it would have fallen to the floor.  We considered pinning it, but gathering an inch of fabric in 2-3 places to hold it up, created puckering and bulkiness that not only looked terrible, but felt bulky and still didn't correct the oversized waist to keep it in place to wear it.

The cincher is cute, but not something that is functional to hold up the under-skirt.  My husband and I actually half-joked about finding suspenders.

I sent it back because between the cringe-worthy inability to wear yellow (banana puddin' yellow! ) and realizing I was going to be spending my night at a party hitching up the skirt and knowing at some point, I'd face my friends with that skirt in a pool around my feet, this costume just didn't work for me.

negative,2.0,"Although these are very cute shoes, they have a number of drawbacks that lead me to not recommend them. The first is that the velco strap makes them hard to get on little ones who do not want to hold still for long. This is also partly due to the fact that I ordered these in my 12 month old's exact size--maybe if I had ordered a size up it would be easier. The strap does not stretch at all though, so if they fit perfectly then you have to unvelcro the strap to get them on and then they are very hard to revelcro when they are a child's foot who is not holding still. The other negative in my opinion is that the inside sole of the shoe is very textured with bumbs and ridges that I don't think my 12 month old likes. He has probably only worn these a couple of times, and they are definitely not my go-to shoe.
The plus of these shoes is that, like all crocs, they are very lightweight and water proof. Once we get them on they seem easy to walk in, but again, I don't think my son likes they way the bottom feels. I would recommend the croc finn sandal instead. We also purchased those and I like them MUCH better. I would also always recommend going up a little bit in size in crocs, it makes them easier to get on and off.",Not my favorite crocs

Unfortunately, they fail in my book because of the cut.  The front rise is about 9"" from the crotch seam, while the back is 17"" from it.  This means that Levis addresses more of the ""junk in the trunk"" issue than the hips one because, as with the traditional Levi cut, the pants come almost straight up.  The pants rely more on stretch than on cut.  Yeah, these fit, but the front is cut far too low to look good with the high back, especially if the fabric is stretched sideways (for hips) more than just in the rear end.  I don't mind the thin stretchy denim because they tend to look dressier than a thicker fabric denim.  I just hate the cut.

negative,1.0,"Update 2/16/16 - Unfortunately for me this bag broke and cracked my laptop. The strap gave way with no notice and with minimal weight (just a 13"" laptop weighing no more than 4lbs. The rating has been adjusted to reflect this issue.

The Lower East Side, NYC. I used to work in banking and I used to live in NYC. There was a local flea market near the park that I used to love walking more for the atmosphere than anything else. Every Saturday morning was a cup of coffee while browsing all of the oddities that found their way to the market, all while smiling about the night before.

During one of these trips a briefcase caught my eye and the man selling it caught me catching it and eveyone was tangled up in catching things. I didn't need or want a briefcase all that much . . . I was middle office after all which is ""Investment Banking"" Aka long hours and little pay. I wasn't dining with clients. Nevertheless the bag was beautiful.

The man said $40 and could tell that I wasn't interested at that price and immediately came down to $25. I agreed on the basis that it was too nice to pass up for that price, even if I didn't have an exact need for it. That was 7 years ago. I moved from banking and joined a startup and that put me anywhere from corporate offices with real client meetings down to plant floors with steel toe'd boots and hard hats. Every project, every meeting this bag was with me. It was in my left when my right shook the hand closing my first major sale. It sat on the oil slick production floor of GM while I spent night and day troubleshooting and programming our first and at the time the nations largest wireless LED network. It has taken an absolute beating over the years and the notches show vibrantly through the weathered leather. I came to find, by chance that the briefcase was genuine leather and the exact model retails for upwards of $350. I had no idea what I was buying and the guy had no idea what he had. The bag held it's own in the real world and my professional life is represented by it.

The above is relevant to the reader debating on purchasing a bag of this nature. A quality bag goes beyond the fashion. A quality bag will stand the test of time and will remind you of where you have been and where you are going. I without a doubt look at that bag and reflect on where i've been in my life. I never had a briefcase before the one that I have now and I would have loved to have a bag like this one as a starter bag. There's some care that i've learned in the earlier years that might have helped preserve my current bag better. That's why I label RuffRyders bag a perfect starter bag.

Starter because it encompasses much of what I would consider a long term briefcase to contain but the reminders of the price point  are evident. The bag is not as bold standing and shrinks back a little when compared to my go to. Let's be reminded here that my current bag is 6 times the price (even though I would never have paid that amount back then for a bag , 6 years later knowing what I know now, I might have).

The bag/briefcase is beautiful and a solid purchase at this price but it earns its ""bag"" label by one glaring flaw and that's the handle. Note in the pictures how my briefcase has a sturdy handle which passes through the flap. Ruffryder chose to make the handle flimsy and more importantly it rests behind the flap. The result  is a less bold more limp bag which at times can look much more like a bag than a briefcase.

The color scheme is spot on and the accents while a bit thinner than I would like are tastefully crafted. The interior holds plenty and it practically swallows my laptop.

I'm cheap and I don't spend money on much but if you're a person that uses a laptop for business and you are a person that holds client meetings then trust me when I say that you should invest in a good briefcase. This bag is perfect if A) You want practice before a big investment or B) You don't meet clients that often but still want to uphold a more professional look. You really can't go wrong at this price.

I was given this bag in exchange for a fair and unbiased review. If you think that I wrote a glowing review just to get the bag then you clearly missed the entire point of this review. I hope to see an improved handle in the future. Note  that some pictures are of my main briefcase for comparison purposes.

Yes i'm in short and dress socks (pictures). Never take life that seriously :)

Instead, it showed my rolls, and if my chest wasn't smaller than average, I would have felt like I was trying to enter some sort of tight/wet t-shirt contest.

Second, they have a cotton crotch that is visible from the outside. I HATE THAT! My advice is if you weigh more than 135 lbs. go ahead and order a large, they will not be too big and don't plan on wearing these unless your backside is thoroughly covered. Oh yeah, they don't fall on your leg like the picture shows, they stop right below your knees.",Disappointed
negative,1.0,I just received the Alma Dance shoe 264301 in black. I am a professional dancer and thought these would be good for travel. Light-weight - and they are. I opened the box and find that the right shoe has glue spots all over the shoe. I can pick it off carefully but it takes some of the suede with it. I ordered my shoe size and the shoe fits fine. The inside sole of the shoe is large-grain sandpaper. I wore them all of 10 minutes and the bottoms of my feet were burning like walking on sandpaper and the upper edge was rough and cut into my ankles when moving. The netting is stiff and bulges out on the side when walking. I do have a narrow foot and ankles so that may be the reason.

negative,2.0,"I have been a loyal Doc Martens fan over the years.  I bought this pair and wore them to work. I was thrilled when I took them out of the box and put them on.  Very comfortable.  Then, when I got to work,  I noticed that the right heel squeaked and made a crackle/crunch sound when walking.  Rather annoying and embarrassing. I could actually replicate the sound when holding and pressing the heal in between my hands. I am returning them even though I wore them once today.  I hope this was a ""freak"" thing.  I will buy another pair, but not this model.  I have a pair of lace-up boots and another brown pair that are many years old.  Love them... They never squeaked.  Luckily, the Amazon refund process was easy... but I wish I could have kept them if they didn't make the odd noise when I walk in them.  Co-workers noticed and actually laughed at me.

negative,1.0,"I bought a pair of the Rosie style bearpaws, and within a month or so, there was a hole in the front of the shoe. I thought it was a freak thing, because all my friends' bearpaws were perfectly fine after about a year of use. So I ordered these, the Emmas. I was really happy with them when they first arrived, but what do you know, within the same timeframe, the sole of the right one had almost completely fallen off. The left one is nearly as bad. I keep having to glue them, but it never stays. Even in the picture, if you zoom in pretty close, you can see a little line of space between the sole and the shoe. Sadly, I don't have enough money to waste on Uggs, though I wish I did, because they would hold up better. There's a reason these are so cheap when they're made out of virtually the same things as Uggs. They're not built well. I don't recommend buying these if you expect them to last long or if you plan to wear them every day. Uggs aren't worth the money, so I'll be waiting here for some other brand to come out with quality shoes. Maybe I'll get some knock-offs at Payless. Don't waste your money here.",Bad Quality

negative,2.0,"So far, I'm impressed. The magnets are quite strong. I managed to drop half of on the Magnetuck in the kitchen. This became quite a hde and seek game as the Magnetuck stuck to the underside of the dishwasher. After 30 minutes, I did find the missing part.

Anyway, I've worn shirt stays for years. I like maintaining the crisp, put together look of always having my shirt tail tucked in. Plus, I'm 6'5"". Shirts are never long enough for me.

I like that Magnetucks have a rubberized exterior. The magnets hold. So far though my tials, they also keep my shirt from pulling out of my pants. However, a belt is really needed to prevent the Magnetuck from slipping past the pant's waist.

Update: they do not help hold up ones socks (no surprise there). What disappointed me and caused me to change my rating is how they came off while wearing them. I hope as moving a latter in work clothes. I felt one side slide off. I caught the Magnetuck. The other half came off in my hand. A part slid down my pants causing me to think I lost it. Fortunately, I felt it fall down into my shoe a few minutes later. Had it to do over again, I would not have purchased them.","Very strong. Nice quality, but come off "
negative,2.0,"I took a chance on these pants and hoped that they would be suitable for hiking. When I tried them on I could instantly tell they were disproportionately huge in the hips and waist, and yet fitted in the ankles and calves. For reference I ordered a size 0 and my hip is 34 inches in diameter. Moving around in them for just those few minutes, my skin felt very irritated. The fabric inside the pants was very abrasive and I can't imagine spending a few hours, much less hiking in these pants. Lastly, considering the price, the quality really wasn't up to par. If I saw these in store I would expect them to cost no more than $20.","Odd Fit, Uncomfortable Fabric, Low Quality"

negative,1.0,"My mother got me this as a gift (along with a different dress from Lindy Bop) for Christmas. The dress arrived smaller than the sizing listed, but would have worked if the bustline wasn't so high. This dress is so cute, but if you are relatively bucksome (I'm only a C cup) the bustline does not go under your bust. So even though the rest of the dress was wearable, just small, the way it was made does not in any way accommodate a woman with a slightly larger than average bust. I am 5' 6"" and 135 lbs, so I am a pretty average size. The Medium we ordered didn't work.

We were considering sending them back and exchanging them for the next size up, until my mother went to the post office with the return shipping sticker to find that it would cost over $100 to ship it back (to the UK) and it was not covered by them or amazon. She was told that she had to bill it to herself, then send them something to reimburse her, but she doesn't trust that type of logic because she's afraid of her money not getting paid back (which I think is a fair fear for how easily people get ripped off on the net). Then we would have to pay for the shipping back here and what if it still doesn't fit? Then we pay for return shipping again and hope to get reimbursed? She didn't want to go through the hassle, unfortunately, which I believe to be fair. I was also a little disappointed that they just let us print the return postage with no notification that we would be responsible. She made a trip to the post office to find out it was her responsibility to pay over $100 in shipping. I think that's a little ridiculous.

The dress itself was a little cheaper quality fabric than I expected, though it was put together well. It's just disappointing that the bustline was so high and unaccommodating. It's a constant problem for me because I have a little bigger than average bust for my size, so everything fits perfect on the rest of my body, except for my bust. Then I have to go a size up and it usually doesn't fit as well everywhere else. The same problem went for the other dress she got me as well, unfortunately. It's a shame the majority of their dresses are built in that same fashion. They have such cute stuff. Just sadness..

EDITED 2/1/14
My mother has been going back and forth with Amazon/Lindy since before my first review. There have been four exchanges as of now, and Lindy has basically refused to print her a shipping sticker that they cover, rather than her paying then having to wait for reimbursement. I was also enlightened further into the situation when she informed me she only paid $10.50 to have it shipped to us. She said she assumed she would be able to send it back for the same amount, otherwise she would have never ordered them if she knew this would happen. I can't blame her. Amazon claims to have filed a claim for her reimbursement, so we'll have to see what happens. Overall, changed to 1/5 for their failure to even compromise or help the situation (Lindy, not Amazon). Highly disappointed.","I posted this same review on the other dress I got but, the bustlines of these dresses do not accomodate bucksome women."

negative,2.0,"So my main problem with sports bra's is I have somewhat of a ""barrel"" chest. It's wide around although I'm petite. Trust me if I had a nickel for every time I told someone what size I wear I'd be a millionaire and not have to work. I may look small but my chest is big - circumference wise. Unlike cup size issues which seem to me to be easier to solve overall being a 40B is a nightmare. I usually end up in 40C and the bra looks like something out of Blade Runner that I've been harnessed into. It could practically function as a top itself because on my 5'1"" frame (130 lbs) it takes up MOST of my chest.

I thought this bra would be different - but, alas, it is not. In a size 40C (could not find a 40B in the store) this thing compresses my entire chest so much I cannot easily breathe while running. It's really quite frightful. It goes up to very close to the indentation at the bottom of my neck where my shoulder blades meet and reaches far down nearly to my waist (not quite that far but further down then I want!). I feel like I'm in a straight jacket.

It does prevent bounce but I'd rather breathe while running. It's NOT tight really just covers so much space on me that it looks more like a full halter top from the 70's.

I did have some success with the same brand and Rebound Racer bra. However the highest that one goes is a 38C so that's what I got. At least the constriction is only around my chest - it's not the most comfortable but it'll do as I continue my search.

negative,2.0,"The blue stripped-pattern faux-wrap skirt is a sheer chiffon material, with turquoise stretchy (polyester) short-shorts attached underneath the skirt.

Pros
- The colors in this skirt are pretty and it was sewn nicely.
- It was true to size.

Cons
- I was surprised that the skirts picture on Amazon did not show the skirt as it really is.  Nowhere on the description did it way that the skirt was
  sheer, with nylon turquoise shorts attached on the inside.  (See pics.)  The description (or at least pictures) need to state/show this.  A sheer
  skirt with shorts is not a style I would choose.

negative,1.0,"The photo shows that there is a seventh bonus pair, but there were only six pairs in my package. If they no longer offer the bonus pair, they should change the photo.

I agree with some of the other reviewers that these are cut funny and that they run small; the sides seem too narrow and are too tight. I'm in good shape and the sides cut into me, creating a not so alluring 'muffin top.' You could wear these under jeans, but not under workout pants or yoga pants due to the sides being too narrow & tight.

The fabric is thinner than I expected from this brand, but for the price I suppose you can't really ask for much. Cute colors & prints, though.

**UPDATE**
After less than 3 months of washing/wearing, the side seams are coming apart. It is almost as if they skimped on the fabric at the waist and then shabbily sewed the pieces together. These have not held up well at all. The fabric is thread-bare and still ill-fitting. Considering that I bought 6 pairs and have probably 35 other pairs of underwear...these have not even gotten much use in the past few months and are STILL falling apart. I would not at all recommend these.","Okay for the Price, But an Odd Fit"

negative,2.0,"Very high-quality pants, and I love the feel of them when wearing. However, be warned of two things:
1) When you wash the pants, plan to spend some time ironing them. They come out of the dryer looking like crumbled up tissue paper. Also plan on steam ironing them after a day of wearing. They start to wrinkle in the crotch and thigh area after just a few hours of wearing.
2) The crease on the pant leg is extremely hard to find after they've been washed. I thought I had found it initially and ironed the pants accordingly, only to find out the next morning that I'd missed the crease by about half an inch, and now had two creases running down the pant leg. My recommendation is not to iron them immediately after they come out of the dryer, but let them hang for a couple of hours. The crease becomes more apparent the longer they set out.

Also, if you need the length adjusted, take to a good tailor. The one I went to adjusted the cuff, but I guess he didn't make his seam at the bottom of the pants as permanent as the original one. After they were washed, the cuff reverted back to the original seam, even though the top off the cuff was sewn to the seam of each leg. This resulted in an uneven and horrible looking cuff, which I had to spend a lot of time straightening and pressing out with an iron.

I love linen, but not enough to spend this much time taking care of ""casual"" trousers. I'll be taking these pants back. This is far from the norm for Jos. A. Banks.","Great pants, but ""wrinkle-resistant""?"

You can see in the picture that there is a ""scrunchie"" fabric at the top--that fabric doesn't cling to your leg tightly, and immediately starts to slide down over my knees, which prompts the entire sock to slowly slide down. The result is the sock is bunched up in two area's--my ankles and beneath the knee.

negative,1.0,"12/28/14 Update: Fruit Of The Loom! Bad dog! Once I think I have found an acceptable maker of underwear, the next package I purchase are terrible. Bought on Amazon some weeks ago, the sizing in the crotch is 3/4 inch narrower than the last set I bought. This, for obvious reasons, is a problem. It seems that makers either rely on the leg elastic to form a pouch or they manufacture a real pouch. FOTL relies on the former and with less fabric, things sag out the side... if you get my drift. And if I get the size bigger I will be swimming. This has got to be a problem for others. Consistency is of the utmost importance. Same problem with Hanes and others. What's a fellow to do? Boxers? No support. Skivvies? Shirts don't stay tucked in. Boxer Briefs? Too much fabric going down the legs. Fig Leaf? Maybe I will try one of those. Dang, Fruit of the Loom!

Now the VINYL on the front is peeling away from the backside. This belt didn't last long at all mainly due to the materials used in it.

negative,2.0,"We bought these for our 3-year-old son, who is in underwear but still has lots of accidents, to cut down on leakage when we're places where a damp child might be unwelcome. They only ""sort of"" work; if we catch the accident right away, the pants can hold some of it, but if we wait even 5 minutes there's a total deluge with or without the plastic pants. The pants can actually make cleanup harder, as they are one more thing to wash, and as my son views them as an almost-diaper, he tends to have more accidents with them on. I think psychologically, some kids react to an article of clothing that reminds them of diapers. So these were not a good solution for us.

Also, the sizes run GINORMOUS. My son wears size 4T shirts & underpants, and the 2T plastic pants were still so huge and puffy on him that he probably needed the 18-month size.

As for using these as low-budget cloth diaper covers, I cloth diapered our son for 2 years and I can't imagine how messy and inconvenient these covers would have been. If there is poop, there is no easy way to get the diaper out of the cover because the cover doesn't have side closures. Poop smears must be common. I also don't think the leg elastics are strong enough to contain what an infant or toddler puts out.

These scrubs are nothing like my other scrubs (Landau, Cherokee, and the $12/piece scrubs at Walmart).  The FIT is two inches narrower at the hips than my other scrub tops, so this top would hike up over my fanny throughout med pass because I have to bend over to get in the med cart a dozen times or more.

I ordered 3 red tops because red what my employer requires for nurses, and I couldn't find any red tops at the local Walmart and I didn't want to spend another $19/top at the uniform store.  The red isn't a rich red, it's slightly orange-y.  The material is shockingly thin and loosely woven.  I held it up to the window on a sunny day and seriously, standing back but looking through this very thin material, I could make out the pond and the building behind where we live.

negative,2.0,"I've been shopping around for a classic fedora for years.  Thanks to the popularity of the $20 ""trilby"" fedoras (very small with an up-turned back brim), it's difficult to find an affordable full size fedora at the normal brick-and-mortar stores.  When I found one on Amazon, I thought this would be it.

However, despite the quality, I find the brim to be too large; more like Indiana Jones' hat or a stylized cowboy hat than a classic 1940s fedora.

I was able to cut the brim down about .5"" - .75"" with a very sharp fabric knife to make it look right, but I would have rather spent my money on a hat I didn't need to modify so dramatically.

negative,2.0,"This Vfun Cross Back Wireless Sports Bra sizing runs VERY small.
I like wearing wireless, seamless sports bras. After reading previous reviews for this Cross Back Wireless Sports Bra, (many of those reviews mentioned that the sizing runs small) I ordered the XL size. For most brands of sports bras that I wear a medium size is a perfect fit, occasionally a large size is a better fit.

I managed to squeeze into it with the back straps crossed and the pushup pads in place. Immediately took it off, removed the pushup pads and uncrossed the back straps, then squeezed into it again. It was just slightly less uncomfortable with the uncrossed the back straps and pads removed.

The fabric is similar to a thick version of the fabric used in compression socks, knee supports, or elbow compression sleeves. The bra flattened my natural C cup breasts and pushed them toward the center of my chest (NOT an attractive look). This bra may work well for someone with very firm and immobile breast implants that aren't as squishable as natural breasts.

I wore the bra while doing some of my normal around the house activities. Any bending caused the bra to roll under my breasts, forcing them up and out of the front low cut V. I was grateful that I wasn't out in public, or in a mixed yoga class.

I received a promotional discount on the purchase price of this item to evaluate it and give my honest unbiased opinion and review for other Amazon shoppers.

negative,2.0,"I have two pairs of Levi's 501 jeans that are 15+ years old and one pair that is 20+ years old, all the same size, and getting a bit aged in terms of wear. Thought it was time to replace them. Bought a pair of 501 shrink-to-fit jeans in the same size as my old jeans, cost about the same as 2-3 pairs of Wal-Mart or Target jeans.

Brought them home, started in on the shrink process. Then spent some more time on it. And then some more time. And strange thing, I noticed several problems:

(1) After shrinking, they didn't feel right. Still stiff, but not nearly heavy enough compared to what I remember.
(2) They did not shrink to the same fit as the old jeans. These ended up baggy, as though I bought a size or two too large.
(3) The stitching was all different. Hem is chintzy, and inseam was single (instead of double) felled (one row of stitches, not two).

Oh no, I thoughtI got counterfeit jeans! Looked more closely. Pinched the fabric between my fingers. The fabric on these brand new shrink-to-fit jeans is probably half as thick as the fabric on my 20-year-old jeans that have been washed hundreds of times. I wear them for a while and they stretch out like Wal-Mart or Target jeans, and in the areas where they are stretching, the white part of the weave is easily visible between the blue parts, like the fabric is barely hanging on. These things are not going to last very long. Probably about as long asyou guessed itWal-Mart or Target jeans.

Then I did some online research and spoke with a former Levi's employee and discovered a few things:

(1) Since I last bought 501 jeans, Levi's has listened to ""market trends"" and recut the 501 series to a ""more relaxed"" fit that ""consumers demand.""
(2) They are also using lighter denim, 12 pound (or lighter!) instead of the old 20 pound raw denim, to cut costs.
(3) They have also changed cut and stitching in the hem and inseam, to reduce fabric needs, you guessed it, to cut costs.

I was asked to check the tag and see where the jeans were made. Haiti. I'm told that Haiti is at the low end of the 501 shrink-to-fit hierarchy, with thinner fabric and worse workmanship. They tell me to look for Mexico or Egypt jeans, they should have better fabric and better stitching. If I want closer to the 501s I already wear, I need to buy the ""Made in the USA"" version which runs $160 a pair, and it still won't match because of the changes to reduce fabric use (i.e. single vs. double felled inseam).

So basicallyI feel cheated. I spent a lot of extra money for Wal-Mart jeans. I hate wasting money. Looks like there's no real reason to buy 501s any longer. I'm sad, because I love my old jeans.

Basically, I did get counterfeit 501 jeans at the end of the day. They just happen to be made by the shell of the company that used to be called Levi Strauss & Co.",These are not the Levi's 501 jeans you know and love.

The design is unlike any other wrap bracelet style I've ever seen; that is not intended to be a compliment. Second, the materials are of the cheapest possibly quality. I didn't realize that because the reviews didn't really spell that out; they were mostly positive. Third, the watch DOES come with a battery - there is a small white gizmo propping up the adjustment knob. It is too small to see in my photos. Yay for the battery....but, you know, good old fashioned instructions explaining this would have been nice.

negative,2.0,"...but because, unfortunately, the convertible part of straps (which was why I purchased this particular bag) kept slipping. The only position they would stay put in, was the backpack position. I could wear the bag like that (which I didn't really buy it for), or I could sling both straps over a shoulder (again, not particularly what I wanted to do). My main purpose, was to use this as a cross body bag, or at the very least, be able to adjust the straps so that I could use it as a shoulder bag. Regardless, the straps, due to the hardware, slid. The bag ended up at its lowest point which was way below my hips (and I'm average height).

Now, the good points. Plenty of room, great design, appeared to be quality material/workmanship (the hardware problem above just seems to need a re-design). Plenty of pockets, that are a great size for glasses (with a hard shell case) a cell phone, etc. Outside pockets are great for keys, and are rather large. The actual bag itself was great.

negative,2.0,"I bought these from a New Balance store because I LOVE the WT10s and had great success with WO90s as they share the same base... These are more in line with New Balance's 110s on the base, minus the comfort, plus a strange upper material that must have a plastic poly material because it crinkles if you need to tighten that section of the shoe-it has no stretch but most crucially was awkwardly formed so the shoe didn't stand a chance of feeling good, even if the extremely stiff bottoms had(and some HAVE-kids' 3090 shoes specifically) worked for when I'm standing or doing a lot of lifting and want a bit more padding and support against slick surfaces without sacrificing comfort... Once you've become accustomed to 4ounce shoes these feel like fabric strapped onto bottom weights-ironically for the brand name, the shoe's balance is completely off and they caused very quick fatigue in one wearing while others have been a breeze and I've been in minimalist shoes over three years (but can still wear the bigger-bottomed when they are designed to fit normal feet).
Echoing what another said, the toe box is also very weird. I ordered the half size up but it made for a taller, not longer, toe. That doesn't really help my toes, not unless I've got a splint under or above one. I only wish I had bought them from Amazon, not the New Balance Outlet where I had to pay return shipping--I'll stick to Amazon or only consider EXACT models I want a second pair of as Minimus have FAR too much sizing, form and fit variation (sometimes within a given model)! I understand why New Balance had trouble moving these-they should never have called these inflexible beasts Minimus. People used to their normal athletic shoes won't necessarily mind but barefoot runners will likely screech as will people in my situation(s)-lots of fractured foot bones, bilateral ankle fractures and/or more comfortable barefoot than in any shoe... Stick to the Wt10s or 20s if you want some tread in a barefoot feeling (Vibram) sole-I haven't had any luck in 20s but they're just too fat and hit the arch at a strange place right at the edge of my own, whereas 10s very lightly curve--mostly at the side where our feet are most narrow--at the precise middle of my arch. Sad to ever not-like  shoe. Pity I chose it to save $30 off the WT10s in grey with purple and orange accents (my favorite color combo). At least they don't run over $110 like the shoes I tried 3x(the Minimus with Gore-tex in rich beautiful purple and black that have toes like clown shoes and crinkle like this set but with far more evil as unlike these which look cheap and tacky in person they looked like a hundred dollar pair). My big advice is stick with Amazon and give any pair a second try if you do like it.

negative,1.0,Well I ordered a medium and I'm pretty sure they sent me a XL. Don't know why they would do that. Do us all a favor Seller send us the right size that we specifically ordered. The quality is not he best but what do you expect for $30.. I got it for two reasons too look somewhat good and too keep me warm. I gave it a 3 star because the quality is not he best and they sent me a different size then what I order which makes me mad. The quality I would rate a 6 or a 7 for the price. I'm being fair. If I wanted a really nice jacket i would have too spend $60 too over $100. The fur is misplaced which I don't like. It honestly could have been worn by someone else at one point. The bag it comes in is a Ziploc type bag which is  a problem and they could have easily just put in the bag once someone had it before. UPDATE I forgot too mention that one of my pockets had a hole. So my suspicion has been confirmed. Someone had this before. I should also mention that it took almost 3 weeks for me too get this jacket. Don't buy please. Something is off about this product . If I am being honest I bought this only for the price. I won't buy this again through this seller. The next jacket I buy I will spend more  MONEY especially for the winter..

negative,2.0,"I know you might often read people saying things in reviews like ""Order a size down"" or ""Order a size up"" etc etc.  Maybe you have realized these suggestions tend to be wrong a lot of the time... but let me tell you, with this shirt you ABSOLUTELY have to order down a size unless you are happy with your shirt being oversized (could be ideal for overweight individuals). I would go even further and suggest maybe even order down TWO sizes.

My size is technically a XL reg, which for most shirts, fits me just right.  So I ordered an XL for this shirt... what I got was labeled as an XL regular but fit like it was a XXXL tall, it was ginormous!  To say I was swimming in the shirt would be an understatement.

Being this is Amazon with their awesome services, I quickly went online and initiated an exchange for a Large. I got my large shirt, and I am happy to say it is a decent enough fit, still a tad big, but I'm sure a run through the wash will take care of that.

So yeah, this is no joke or understatement, order a size down!  Also for reference, the shirts I got were made in Mexico.

As for the quality of the shirt, it is top notch!  Nice and thick and feels like it will last a lifetime.  Most shirts you get nowadays are thin (practically see-through), weak and barely last a month because of companies skimping out on materials to save a few $$, but no expense is spared with this shirt, and you definitely get what you paid for.  Also this shirt is pretty long, more so than I personally like but it would be ideal for tucking in.  And since it is plenty long, if you go untucked you can rest assure that you won't be getting any wise-cracks every time you bend down to pick something up.

EDIT 1/10/12:  I am dropping my star rating to 2.  As I mentioned above the sizing for these shirts is massive, but I liked my large charcoal shirt so much I decided to get a lighter colored one, in the Ash color.  Since I was reasonably assured by ordering the same size shirt I got last time (a large which fit me pretty nicely), I ordered another large thinking it would be of consistent sizing.

Sadly in this case even the large was WAY too big, in fact it is about 3 inches longer than my other large, and it is also much wider as well.  It is not a tall version, the tags and everything on the packaging and shirt say Large, Reg.  This is absolutely ridiculous to have this much difference in sizing.  This shirt is big enough to be considered a XXL tall by most standards.

For the record, this Ash color is made in Haiti (at least mine was), whereas my other large Charcoal color was made in Mexico.  So perhaps if I got a ash colored shirt made in Mexico a large would have fit me consistency with my other shirt, but since we have absolutely no idea what shirt is made where and which one we could get, I feel the inconsistent sizing and standards of these Carhartt shirts is beyond unacceptable.  It is sad to think a company like Carhartt is becoming so unreliable, it is getting so hard to find decent/reliable products nowadays and this situation has only soured me even more.

Since there is free return shipping I am sending the overly big large back and am going to try my luck on a Medium sized Ash shirt.  I will edit my review with my findings when it arrives.

EDIT 1/13/12: My new replacement medium shirt came in yesterday.  It was also made in Haiti.  The length of the shirt is identical to the large (it is extremely long for a medium, way too long) but its side-to-side sizing is definitely smaller, almost too small for me (which will shrink even more when I wash it).

Overall the sizing variance is highly unacceptable and I am keeping my star rating to 2.  And while I really like these shirts in terms of thickness and look, I am not sure I will dare try to order another color as the sizing may vary as wildly as the sizing between the ash and charcoal colors.

The footbed is small (I went up a half size and there wasn't much wiggle room), the ankles were baggy, mid-calf was so tight it felt like a compression sock, and the top bulged out like you would expect on a looser fitting boot--did not conform to my leg at all.  For reference, the widest part of my calves is 14.25 inches (over skinny jeans) and I normally wear a US size 7 shoe, but prefer to wear a 7.5 (which I ordered) due to tendonitis and wanting to wear thick socks on my upcoming trip to NYC.  AND it appears that the boot shafts are two different sizes, as one was very tight and the other was just a little snug.  I measured, three times, just to make sure my calves hadn't gotten enormous overnight and/or one leg was bigger than the other.  Nope, both calves were the same size.  I walked around the house and up and down the stairs in them and they were horribly clunky and didn't have any give at all.  For the cost, I'm not willing to break them in and see if they stretch--don't really want to spend a month in a very COLD Northern MN winter with no circulation going to my feet.

I was surprised they seemed to have shrunk a bit, tighter in the body, neck and cuffs.  They also now felt ""itchy"".

negative,1.0,"This is the third Hanks belt I have purchased since January, 2018.  The first one I threw in the trash because the color was nothing like what it was advertised as and it generally just didn't feel right.  My money was refunded so I thought that was reasonable and decided to purchase the ""every day""  belt.  That belt was so uncomfortable around the buckle area and stuck out so much there that I put it in a bench vise to see if I could squeeze a little thickness out of it.  The leather around the buckle attachment area split on both sides of the prong so now I have a new belt that is held together with some nylon thread.  The third belt is the Canyon Belt.  The leather is really nice but at the spot where the belt attaches the leather bows out and cannot be made to stay in place.  Like the other two belts,  I can not use this one either.  This belt does not even do its main job, which is to help hold my pants up.  To the contrary,  my pants stay in place better without this belt than with it. I struggled with it today, twisting and turning it in every direction with some pliers and a wooden dowel.  Still,  when I look down I see the end  of the belt bowing outward,  as if I am looking under a bridge.  Most belt makers have solved this problem by skiving off some of the leather in the area of the belt strap which is devoted to securing the buckle.  Not Hanks!  Apparently they have some secret intention to make us all look like slobs.  I reluctantly wore this belt to work, thinking that since I had spent $70.00 for a stupid belt I might as well get some use out of it or give it to somebody or something.  During the night I had to use the bathroom and fully expected Hanks belt to perform adequately in this regard.  By the time I made it to the bathroom I had to go pretty bad. A swift and strategic dropping of the drawers was in order to avoid a costly and awkward mistake, if you know what I mean.  Visions of Hank squirming on the cross flashed through my mind as I yanked and yanked, first with one hand,  then with two on the heavy strap digging into my sides, then one hand on the buckle and one on the strap, yanking and pulling as hard as I could, with no regard for the damage being done to the flesh surrounding the load of which I wished so strongly to be relieved.  Luckily, I carry a 4.1 ""  Zero Tolerance flipper in my pocket and was able to make short order of the crappy  Hanks belt which was destined, it seemed, to ruin another one of my days.  I do not know what was wrong with that belt, but the only way I could get it off was to cut it off.  Has anyone ever heard of such a thing?  How can a company stay in business selling crap like this? That makes three in a row,  Hank.  You know what they say don't you?

negative,2.0,"I was intrigued to see what these shoes are like...it's kind of hard to tell very well from the images online.  So I requested them and tried them out.

First - fit:
These shoes fit as expected.  The shoe is comfortable, enough, but certainly not a 5-star fit.  The elastic inner lining around the foot and heal gave the shoe a loose fit there...I could feel my heels shifting and moving as I walked along.  I guess it was a 4-star fit.

Appearance:
When I took a good long look at these shoes it was hard to see what they really wanted to be.  If a senior citizen's walking shoe and water socks had a baby and wrapped it in brushed suede this is what you'd get.  There are actually aspects of oxfords, tennis shoes, water shoes, and walking shoes but not enough of any of them to really take control of the overall appearance.  Appearance - 3 stars.

Overall impression:
I wore these all day a few days back and I must admit that for some reason I was quite conscious of the shoes.  I couldn't really put my finger on it until I saw them in a mirror and the word that leaped out at me, screamed actually was ""GERIATRIC.""  They actually made me feel old...OK...older than I actually am.  How much older?  Maybe 10 years...late sixties instead of late fifties.  That's not good.

I didn't realize just how bad they were until my college aged son breezed in and saw them.  He immediately asked (in all seriousness), ""Is Grandma here?""  He thought they were her shoes...she's in her late 70s.  I knew then that I was done with them.

I am not really much of a slave of fashion, but when just wearing the shoes made me feel old and that was confirmed by me son I knew it was time to pull the plug.

neutral,3.0,"I purchased mine directly from Carhartt. I would have purchased on Amazon but NOT ONE review that I read was helpful to me. Hopefully mine clears a few things up:

 I am a 5' 10 1/2"" 220 lb male with a gut. I own at least 20 Carhartt jackets in size XL Reg. The only exception is the J233 sherpa lined denim jacket. I need a XXL Reg in those because the waist is small and they run short.

 SAME WITH THIS MODEL !

 If you normally buy an XL Reg in Carhartt and are LEAN OR TONE in the torso you buy your REGULAR size. If you are an XL Reg but have a gut and a non athletic build GO UP ONE SIZE....NOT TALL just ONE regular size up. It will be a little looser but also give you just a little more length in the torso (not much). You will need to wash and shrink a little before it fits a little tighter.

Quality ?

Sorry folks but not the most durable of the Carhartt jackets that I own. The ""look"" is rough and tough but the actual jacket is rather thin and equal to a medium weight denim jacket.

I saw these red Propet Travelwalkers II and decided it would be fun to have a red pair. They had only one pair left in the 8 narrow size, so I was very disappointed when they arrived and the tongue of the left shoe was completely pulled out and the right tongue was on the verge of coming out as the stitches were very loose and did not appear to be secured. Normally I would return a product that was defective, but I really like the shoe and it was the last pair. So I am sewing the tongues back into each shoe, but I should not have to do this.

I'm staying at home with my kids now, so when I saw these on sale for 1/3 the price of Danskos, I thought I'd give them a shot, because I'm not putting shoes through the ringer like I was before. The fit: I bought the wide, and while they are wide enough, they seem tight from the top of my foot to my arch. The comfort: They are alright, but they're no Dansko. My feet ache in them after a few hours of normal wear. Maybe it's just my feet, but I expected to like these a lot more after reading all the glowing reviews.

Also, I already knew from the pictures this would be an issue, but the inside is not breathable, it is conducive to sweaty feet. Be aware. I wish they had made a soft inside, instead.
For toe room (if this was the right size) I would wish for more of a toe-shape instead of converged awkward point; anything to make it not squished.

I am glad the bottom outside is soft, grippy, and not noisy, but the universal problem is, the heel always has the noisy hard plastic. I have yet to find a WORKING product to mask this (they should just make them accordingly).

neutral,3.0,"(Writing for senior citizen who plays softball on a league) Bought these because Blephritis eye symptoms of being light sensitive was threatening to stop me from playing. Before buying these I'd only tried 'regular' (NOT wrap around) sunglasses & they'd never work well for me so I didn't like to wear them.

A year ago I because of my eyes light sensitivity I bought a pair of $80 sunglasses which were not wrap around and supposed to be great. I had trouble seeing on the ball field and they just didn't stop the sun from bothering my eyes even though they are dark lenses & excellent UVA/UVB protection. I'd look up from my position playing First Base and couldn't see the ball coming out of the sky at me with my $80 sunglasses.

Someone ordered me these RIVBOX 801 Polarized Sport Sunglasses after reading lots of great reviews here. They have made a world of difference for me & I would recommend them to anyone. Really like the vents at the top which inhibit fogging up and they are very comfortable on my wide head. There was NO 'break in time' of hurting behind the ears for me either. I can't believe they are only $20!

(Impossible to remove the lens it has in frames. Book is no help - I'm in my 40's & helping this gentleman out - found two really bad videos online showing how easy it was to remove the single lens that goes straight across the glasses which are full framed within the plastic on top (that goes across the eyes and the attached plastic nose guard that is all one piece of the frame. I'm pulling as hard as I can on 1 corner to get it started but the lens has nowhere to go down because the plastic noseguard (yellow plastic) is attached from the inside directly to the top plastic piece that goes across your eyebrows. If I pull much harder I'm just going to bend the plastic on that one side up and crack it before it gets released from the channel & would have to do that from the other side as well and then supposedly pop it out of the nose guard somehow - the plastic nose guard does not bend so not sure how that will work. If you buy the Expensive version by another manufacturer of these sunglasses you get a channel lock/release on one side by the temple that allows you to switch the lenses. The polarized lenses are fantastic for sun, but we need them for night driving, too, and they are not made for that - too dark.)",Before buying these I'd only tried 'regular' (NOT wrap around) sunglasses & they'd never work well for me so I didn't like to we

And I have only gained 4lbs throughout my entire pregnancy so while my belly has definitely grown, I feel a better maternity support band would've been a bit bigger. The velcro does allow it to adjust in size quite a bit so that is definitely a plus. The velcro also has a nice, strong grip and seems to be high quality.

neutral,3.0,"those suspenders are actually pretty good with the exception of two obvious flaws...
the first seems to be the sharp edges on the inside of the sliding metal buckles... over some time they can definitely ruin your shirt or even your skin... got it fixed by just bending those edges a bit toward the inside with pliers... it feels and looks better now, though still not perfect...

the second problem are the small metal pins inside of the plastic fasteners that can just easily fall out... it actually happened to me the moment I tried the suspenders on for the very first time... there are three simple solutions for this problem as I see it:

- first, the original pins can be replaced with some thin steel wire like some short pieces of an ordinary paper clip with their ends bent over to secure them in place...
- the other solution would be to put a tiny drop of crazy glue on both ends of each pin and then let it dry...
- the third one would be to cover the holes, through which the pins are inserted, with tiny pieces of black duct tape...
I personally have chosen the third one for the moment and let's see how it will work...",OK but with two flaws...

My son asked me not to return it, although Amazon was completely okay with and offered several times. So I cleaned it up, disinfected it and built a battery pack from one of the last RadioShacks around me.

The fit. My son is a 4T. The legs and arms are nowhere near short enough for kids his size. I'd say by about 6"" on all extremities. The mask/helmet needs nose foam to keep the eyes where they need to be. There needs to be venting put into the mask. I recommend on the sides of the mask. Like if you're looking at the face, at the 430 and 730 positions near the seam. And vent holes in the very top of the mask/helmet. That way cool air gets drawn in from the bottom and hot air vents out. Plus, it allows for better hearing.","Had unusual experience, read review"

neutral,3.0,"I have to say that I rarely find 'one size' fits my hands, so perhaps I should have known better, but these were on sale! At any rate, these gloves were a tad snug and, frankly, are made for women with VERY short fingers. The fabric between fingers landed just past my knuckle, so it looked a bit like my hands were webbed. Perhaps I just have extra long fingers, I don't know.

I did test these gloves on my HTC Rhyme and they performed beautifully, perhaps even better than using my naked finger! Also, their construction is nice and solid; the fingertips seemed especially strong, though on that point they do stick out a little when the gloves are worn. That may be the price for gloves that won't unravel in a matter of weeks...or days.

Overall, if you have petite-er hands, these seem like they would be excellent gloves, but if you normally find that one size does not, in fact, fit all, these probably won't fit you, either.

neutral,3.0,"i was looking for a nice watch for my husband, as he will not buy one for himself and his old workhorse is about ready to be put out to pasture. When I saw this one, I thought it would be great. He likes bigger watch faces and it's not flashy. However, it has its pros and cons.

First - it's a nice watch overall. It keeps excellent time and works well. The metal band is quite nice, though maybe not for everyone.

However - the band is HUGE. Seriously. We took it to a local watch place to have some links removed, and after the guy took out 6, he said that he couldn't take out any more...and it's still too big for my husband's wrist. Granted, he's not exactly a tower, but...you may need to be to wear this watch. In addition, he likes to be able to see his watch at any time, day or night. This is not going to work for that. Any light absorbed eventually wears off, leaving the wearer in the dark.

Overall, it appears to be a pretty decent watch. But do pay close attention to your wrist size, otherwise you'll have a watch that you just can't wear.","Nice, but HUGE."

neutral,3.0,"People shopping for a poncho will likely notice a fairly large disparity of price between the throw-away style of poncho made of extremely thin material and (at most) a metal snap or two, and those that cost 20 or 30 times more, but are hand-crafted and made to last forever. I was in the segment that needed something in between. I wanted something lightweight, tightly packed, that would survive a two week hike in the mountains of North Carolina and Tennessee.

This RothCo poncho worked adequately for my needs. Folded up, it took very little space. When on me, it kept me dry, and was strong enough not to rip and tear on every branch I came in contact with. It was also strong enough to have some paracord run through it to help along with another poncho and a tarp for a makeshift canopy on our campsite.

After about a week, I did begin to notice some slight fraying and ripping along stress points on the material and around the snap enclosures.

neutral,3.0,"Overall, these are solid sandals that I will wear when I need to do a lot of walking on rougher terrain. Took them on a vacation immediately after buying and did a lot of walking without a break-in period. Overall, I was satisfied. The sole is thick and stable (no flopping and you are protected from feeling rocks and such on the ground), the heel cup is comfortable and molded, and my feet weren't tired even after a lot of walking. They are also easy to clean, and dry quickly when wet. Loads more supportive than a flip flop and easier to clean than Birkenstocks.

While good, they are not perfect and there are a few reasons I didn't rate them higher. While not dealbreakers for me, hopefully these specifics will help others make an informed decision. First, the heel strap has a nice pad on it, but I found the strap still rubbed one of my heels (but not the other) no matter how I adjusted the velcro. This suggests the sizing may be slightly off. Unfortunately, it's not possible to adjust the the heel strap to make it looser or tighter, so all you can do is make the top tighter. I also found the thin straps across the top of the foot a bit uncomfortable. The way the shoe is designed, the weight of the thick rubber sole is anchored across the top of the foot (next to the ankle) and not assisted by the other straps nearer the middle/front of the foot. As a result, it tugged on my ankle so the back third of my foot felt heavy. I think I will adjust, but this is a design issue that could be solved with a thicker strap in this area or the ability to adjust the heel strap.

I also disagree with other reviewers who say this shoe is dressy enough to go from hiking to dinner. This still very much looks like a typical Teva sandal. The velcro is obvious and there's a giant contrasting ""TEVA"" logo on the ankle strap.

I had to pry my foot in using a shoe horn and rubbing alcohol (which helps to stretch the leather).

The material is very thin, and kind of scratchy, but I believe it'll soften up after washing with a good softener (I believe it strongly enough that I cut the tags and threw it in the wash, so there's that).

neutral,3.0,"I bought this to shrink my belly and provide back support post partum. It was so large that I ended up using it as a support girdle when I was pushing 10 months and huge. I ordered a Medium; the sizing is incredibly generous.

I put it on when I left the birth center - only 4 hours after having my baby. It helped a lot with that initial shift where my organs were all relocating and dropping back into place. I liked having all of my vitals tucked into my body cavity where they belonged.

In the following days, it was nice to have some support while my muscles healed a little. It still fit, but I was wrapping it up really tight at this point. I had no issue with rolling, and the velcro holds very well.

It provided no cosmetic assistance as far as sucking in my gut. Perhaps it made the gut appear smoother, but that is all. It isn't shapewear, and there is no way to make it tight enough to provide a significant binding effect. I went out to eat with my family the following day, and I still looked quite pregnant in spite of the waist binder.

I am really disappointed that these do not stay hidden with the two pairs of shoes I've tried them with so far.  I have to hold them in place, down around the sides of my feet, then slip my foot into the shoe.  They always end up creeping back up around my foot throughout the day, requiring more adjustments.  Both of the pairs of shoes I tried them with aren't what I would consider particularly revealing, as they both hide my toe cleavage.  The socks just come that far back on the tops of my feet.  Hopefully they'll work with other shoes, because I like the concept.  They definitely would not work with any shoes that are a little snug, because they have a substantial thickness.

neutral,3.0,"This is an attractive belt.  Functionaly, it has some drawbacks.

The buckle has a peg that is used to fasten into the holes in the leather.  But that gives it less play than a traditional buckle.  Newer alternatives with the notch system offer even more play with greater sizing options.

The peg buckle also alters how useful the reversability is.  When reversed the belt tip bends outwards.  And there is no loop to secure the excess belt length.

Finally the buckle itself has a coating that wears away unevenly.  Over time that will make it age less attreactively than alternatives.

neutral,3.0,"Although this is a ""running"" shoe, I don't run and just needed an athletic shoe for walking around town and going to the gym. I ordered a size 12 and have been wearing it for a while. So far my big toe tends to rub or touch the tip of the shoe, I can only use thin socks (anything too thick makes it uncomfortable). While the colour is very funky, I believe a half size may have worked out better for me (12.5M not available though). If I wear it for short periods of time it's OK, but not perfect.

I have a NB 740 Stability running shoe in size 12 that fits perfectly. I think the fit has a lot to do with the shape of the front of the shoe.

neutral,3.0,"These shoes rate 5 stars for beauty, fit, and ease of use (i.e. young kids can put them on themselves). We loved the look and comfort, too, as we have with previous Naturino shoes. Had we only used these gently, I would have rated them highly.

However, durability and quality are questionable, especially due to price. After three months of wear about 3 days a week, these shoes are looking very shabby. Buyers should be advised to use these as dress shoes for special, indoor occasions, and not for active play. My daughter wore these on the playground, at the park, and a few times to ride her bike. It became quickly obvious that this shoe would not work for active play. One shoe quickly scuffed at the toe from dragging her foot while on her bike, rubbing away the glitter and next two layers down to the cloth below. This was pretty rough play. However, glitter is also coming off of the area where the shoes flex between the front and back, and off of the other shoe's toe area, from what I believe to be normal wear. Worst of all, the soles are detaching - starting at the toe and continuing for 3/4 of the length of the shoe on both sides, and the inside back of the heal has been worn off.

neutral,3.0,"Light summer cover up. Clingy. Casual wear only.
I normally wear US-XL to XXL in tops, but I ordered a XXXL due to the reviews saying it ran small, and I wanted a loose look. But the shoulders were way big and hung 3 inches off my shoulder. So I bought it too big.
But it is just ok to cover over my sun dress, or tank top with skirt in the summer. More for a trip to the zoo or park or shopping.

The Lilac color is actually a different shade and a little lighter than I see on my monitor.

The example picture is misleading and should be updated and photographed on a real person not a size one manikin. It shows a very small fitted version of this cardigan with a standard hem. In reality, It has a shark-bite hem, the collar lays flat, and it is not fitted or ""A"" framed like the picture.

The shark bite hem comes to the crotch in front and is shorter behind, then trails about 6 inches longer on the sides. Keep in mind this a XXXL I am wearing. Smaller sizes will be shorter, above the crotch by a few inches. I don't know any plus size women who like shark bite hems that expose the crotch and upper thighs.  For this reason, I only wear it in public with a skirt or sun dress. For my attached pictures, I wore a light form fitting outfit under to show where the hem hangs. I would never wear this out on the town. I think the ruched arm design also make my arms look even bigger.
All in all, I just don't think this is the best look for a plus size woman.
It does come nicely packaged, but wrinkled. I found washing in cold and hanging the wrinkles come right out.

neutral,3.0,"This facial moisturizer is a very good lightweight daily moisturizer. I haven't noticed any significant changes in my skin from this moisturizer and it probably better as a summer skincare product. I love the ingredients and I am confident using all the Juice Beauty products on my sensitive skin because of the high quality, organic ingredients that really do improve the texture and glow of delicate facial tissue. Additionally, I am not crazy about the scent, while it's certainly acceptable and very subtle, it almost smells, 'stale' or flat, for the lack of a better description. I would prefer it have more of a 'fresh' apple or fruit-like, light and organic fragrance, than this same scent that seems pretty common in many of the other similar organic products I have used before.

I really love the other products I am using from Juice Beauty - The Stem Cellular Booster Serum is fantastic and when used together with this Age Defy Moisturizer, I would give this moisturizer four stars rather than just three. Also the Cellular Instant Eye Lift is an innovative and surprisingly effective eye and skin treatment! I give both of those products by Juice Beauty -- five stars. Alone, the Green Apple Age Defy Moisturizer seems to be just an average daily skincare product, but clean and safe for all skin types.

neutral,3.0,I will start off by saying this...  They are beautiful pjs and I don't plan on returning especially because I need them and can't find any in store anymore BUT my reasons for the low rating are a couple....  1. Material is OK nothing cheap but nothing special (but pjs I've gotten at wal mart feel nicer)  no biggy for me but I can see it being a problem for others...  2. The sizing is weird lol I got the 3T my son is a 3T and sometimes its slightly loose on him but works lenght wise he's very skinny and ok in height..  These pjs were extremely slim so if you have a thicker or even average size kid these might be tight and not sure that sizing up would help since they were true to size in the length aspect but again my son is VERY VERY slim so they worked....  3. The butt placement is soo off and that part does bother me ALOT!!!  lol I don't mind that it doesn't open up were out of diapers so that's no biggy but the fact that it's on the middle of his back and not his butt makes me cringe a little...  a lot lol again not sure if maybe sizing up would fix the problem but worth a shot.

neutral,3.0,"I have slightly full feet but I have always been able to offset my ""tall"" feet by ordering a 1/2 size up. This has worked for me for decades with sneakers, boots, dress shoes and sports equipment (skis and hockey skates.) With the Wander Lace Canvas I eventually settled for a size that was a 1/2 size larger and a full size wider to fit in them comfortably.

This shoe is really tight in the mid-foot exuding a painful pressure at the base of both ""pinkie toes."" I can offset this discomfort with a medium-weight sock but I bought this shoe with the purpose of wearing it casually- With shorts and a light, thin low-profile sock. Nope, not with these puppies. After a half hour wow, my dogs are barking! It feels like someone wrapped one of those lobster claw rubber bands around my foot. All I want to do is take these things off. It took me two resizings to get the fit to work.

Conclusion: These shoes look great offering a perfect casual flair to shorts but without the arrogance of Bass Bucks or the peppiness of Sperry Topsiders but sizing will be a challenge if you wear a D size or wider and/ or have full feet. Buy them but be prepared to send them back for a new size.",Look great. Appear to be well constructed but sizing will be a problem

Not sure if the shoe stretched to fit my feet or if my feet got smaller, but after about 3 hours the fit was nice. The quality seems okay and the shoe seems a lot more breathable than my leather work shoes. The sole outer edge is definitely more like a boot than a sneaker, meaning that you need to get used to the heel when walking downs stairs, because it sticks out a tad. Only worn once, so as I have more feedback to mention, I'll update this entry.

Update: 12/15/2017
I have been using this for work for about two years now. I use it about twice a week. Only one bad thing has caused me to wonder if I would purchase it again. It's started out with an annoying squeak on the right side. The left side didn't squeak. Only the right side. No matter what I tried to do to reduce it, the squeak never went away. Now after two years, it has gotten really LOUD. It doesn't appear to be indicating that the shoe is about to fall apart. It's still a good shoe. It's something inside the rubber sole. I tried sanding the bottom and even put a torch to it, thinking that it was the rubber surface contacting anything hard that caused it. Nope. It's inside the rubber sole. EXTREMELY ANNOYING!!!

Update: 4/11/2018
I can't stand the squeaking!!! It's gotten so loud. And I'm hard of hearing! It's embarrassing to walk around the office with them. I purchased a new Skechers work shoe to replace it and will just use it around the yard. The shoe could go for another couple of years, though it has started to become discolored with light and dark areas. I do like the fit and last of the Keen work shoes, but will watch for any chance of squeaking on my next pair",ANNOYING SQUEAK!!!

I generally shy away from a partial heel back because they can be irritating when your foot shifts, but that isn't an issue with these (I take 8.5-9 M in shoes and ordered the Medium).  The fit was perfect at first, but after a month's wear -- or less -- the faux fleece lining has crushed completely and appears quite worn.

Here is how I am torn...
It came with a 1/2 inch tear on the chest.  It wasn't extremely noticeable, in fact I didn't pull it  out of the package to try on (my poor choice) for at least a month after buying it so I did not see the tear before the return window was up.  So now I am trying to figure out how to patch or repair the coat without being noticeable.  The fabric cannot be sewn in a traditional sense and it is a synthetic so it would melt if I tried an iron on patch (which would look silly anyway)

Cons:
The exterior shell is a very delicate fabric compared to types of coats made by Columbia or Champion.  I am concerned after seeing how thin the exterior fabric is that it may not be too durable.

Either way I am keeping the coat since it is past the return period and I hope to get at least one season out of it this fall.",I am torn -literally

neutral,3.0,"Bit on the musky side for my liking.

Full disclosure: I have an unnatural love for Acqua di Gio. Its citrusy notes make me so happy. I love sandalwood, jasmine, and orange. A bit of spicy fragrance is cool too. It's why I've loved Gio for so long. When I saw that this fragrance is in the citrusy side, I was happy to give it a shot. Also, bear in mind that I don't wear fragrance every day, because I enjoy cooking, and you don't want anything to interfere with the smell of the food.

According to the marketing notes for L!ve, it's meant to hit you with lime at the forefront, and then bring out green notes of leaves in the background. That's fine by me. Guess what I didn't get? Lime. Leaves. What I did get is this overwhelming musky smell, which I dislike. Axe body spray grosses me out. I hate the stuff, and damn near every teenage boy I know bathes in the stuff.

L!ve has a strong musk to it. The musk overpowers the citrus, the leaves, and the liquorice that was promised. That said! It does have a sweetness to the edges of the scent which is rather nice. There's also a ground note of earthiness rather than freshness. Why is this good? It covers the smell of sweat rather handily. Other fragrances, that tend towards the lighter, more airy side tend to clash with the natural scent of the body, and will be jarring. If you're one of those types that sweats a lot, L!ve is your jam. It's got serious staying power. One spray (AND NO MORE) is enough to last throughout the work day, and leave a little bit of lingering fragrance at the end of the day. Don't do more than one spray, or you'll be consumed by the scent. It's better to have it be subtle than something that people can smell before you show up.

Bear in mind that this is eau de toilette, which means that it's not going to be as strong as an eau de parfum. Generally, it'd mean that you'd need to put more on to get the effect. Not the case here. The fragrance is strong, and has plenty of staying power.

Why did I not rate this lower? Because it does grow on you over time. Throughout the day, I noticed that it mellowed out from the harsh muskiness that I got when I first put it on. And, as a product goes, it's not a bad product. It just doesn't live up to the promises it makes.",Eau de teenage boy

Below are the biggest the pros and cons you should consider when buying this. No, it doesn't look like a Rolex but yes, its nice. I read other reviews with people comparing them and I can say that's total BS.  Yes, its a nice automatic watch but it looks like a $85 watch nothing more nothing less.

Pros-  Looks nice, is automatic, isn't too expensive.

Cons- The watch band is HUGE and you'll need to take it somewhere and pay more money to get it adjusted.  Its hard to adjust the date and it can be a real pain to get it working right.  The one we bought switches days at 12pm not am. Should be an easy fix but NOPE, it keeps doing the same thing over and over.  Besides that the only other con i've seen so far is the watch band is crazy big and we had to pay $5 more to get it adjusted at a jewelry store.

PS:  I paid $80 for the watch and now its $5 more. It looks like their trying to raise the price up more. You gotta decide if you wanna pay that much but yeah not sure i'd ever pay above $80 for it.

UPDATED: well, it's been almost a year and my father-in-law still loves the watch. Has held up good. Only negative thing is he says it likes to be off by 5 or so minutes sometimes. He simply adjusts it and the problem is solved. Other than that, good watch.",Ok watch if you want something automatic

- the slots are thin, can barely hold 2 cards. My earlier wallet could go 3-4.
- The ID card slot is tight too, really tight. And the cut to slide your card out, doesn't work. I can never slide out my ID and its even worse than my previous wallet, where i could take it out even without that cut. I think its s***ty plastic they have used.

neutral,3.0,"I'm not sure how to do this review because I only received 3 products in hair on the go package, and only 1 is one of the items in the picture.  That's why I gave it 3 stars. I don't know if this was a mistake in shipping or they did not link me to the correct product.  When I click to do the review the above package with 4 items is what shows up.  I would give these products more stars because all three of the products that I did receive do a good job on my hair.  However, I don't want anyone to have a problem with products I have not reviewed.  I did some research on Amazon and found out I received the Phyto Mix and Match Hair Trio, so that is what I am reviewing.

My hair has been really dry lately.  These products make my hair more manageable and less fly away, especially the phytodensia that is pictured with the set on this webpage. I switch off between the 3 products, so I use a hair mask twice a week.  Two of the products have the look and consistency of soft bubble gum.  The pump container has a thinner consistency like conditioner.  All spread easily into my hair. I leave on my hair while Im taking a shower and then rinse out.

Im going to be buying more of the trio once I run out.  Its cheaper to get a Phyto set than to buy a full container of one item. So I recommend doing that, if you want to determine which product will do the best on your hair.  I give the trio I received 5 Stars.","PHYTO hair products work, but I received different products than pictured here"
neutral,3.0,"I heard so many wonderful things about these that I think I got my expectations too high.  I bought these to wear under skirts and dresses to keep my thighs from rubbing together (I. Freaking. Hate. Chub. Rub.), but it just didn't work for me.  Like almost everything else I've tried so far, these roll up, so I spend all day trying to subtly pull them down as I walk, which I'm sure looks SUPER cute.  If I don't, I've got fabric bunched up at the top of my legs and my thighs are still rubbing together.  If I flip them inside out, that *sometimes* helps, but not much.  Going up a size probably won't solve this either, because then I think they'd slip down my waist.  I just don't think these are made for my very curvy body type, so someone a little less hip-y might be more successful with them. So far, the only thing that seems to work for me are baseball/softball sliding shorts that are a lot longer but meant to really stick to your legs without rolling up, so for now, I have to stick with those because these just don't cut it for me.

neutral,3.0,"My initial review after having this for a day or so. I will update my review in about two weeks after having used it day in and day out.

Right out of the box it's very attractive and easy to set up. I love that I can use it three different ways. Wear it as a bracelet, on my clothing or as a necklace! I work in a hospital so being able to wear it on my person is very helpful especially with all of the gloves and hand washing I do!

As of right now it's a very simple activity tracker that appears to only have two alarms and a pill reminder. As for accuracy of the ""steps"" taken throughout the day I can't really say just yet and I will include that in my updated review two weeks from now.

Cons: Doesn't appear to be able to sync with ihealth app (iPhone). Although, I'm hoping that since it's so new that it will be an added feature in the firmware.

Would like more than two alarms. So far that doesn't seem to be an option but also hoping that's included in future firmware updates.

UPDATE!!!!

I've used it constantly for about a week and have decided to update my review earlier than I said I would.

PROS:
Beautiful
Can wear with anything (dressy or casual)
Easy to wear
Secure and does not feel like it will fall off
Love that I don't have to charge it every so often
Easy to sync

CONS:
Not accurate (steps or sleep)
Not able to manually edit my sleep (explanation below)

Does not sync with apple iHealth app (yet?)
Only three (3) alarms

Ok, now for the explaining! As I previously mentioned I work in a hospital so I get a lot of steps in! Sometimes about 12k (12,000) but on average 10,500 or so. The leaf has been about 2k to 3k steps off which is a lot.

I don't like that the app is glitchy, I tried to adjust my slee since one night I went to bed at 9pm. The app was glitching out on me and would change the time to AM as opposed to pm! Strange, but I guess it's to be expected from a first generation product?

positive,5.0,It is that time of the year in which my work attire requires short sleeved polo shirts.

positive,4.0,"I bought this tailed tuxedo as a costume for a play, expecting not much and hoping it would get by for a few nights. I was surprised when it came how nice it is. Someone else wrote that it's not really a  super 150 wool, which I wouldn't know, but it is certainly a very nice fabric feel which looks good and has a nice weight. I might not wear it to Buckingham Palace or the White House, but then I don't get invited there anyway and you probably you don't either. It was delivered promptly, the correct size (difficult as I wear short size). It even came on a hanger in it's own garment bag and with extra buttons. Definitely exceeded my expectations.",What a surprize!
positive,5.0,The Lucas Vortex Ultra Lightweight suitcase exceed my expectations. I took it on my trip to Europe recently and was very happy with it. This lightweight suitcase handles very well with great spinner wheels. (This was especially important to me because my last suitcase fell way short in this department). The material is sturdy and a great color-easliy recognizable at baggage claim. This suitcase stood up to the rough handling by the baggage handlers and passed with flying colors. I also like that it has front pockets and the expandable zippers.,Exceeds expectations.

positive,5.0,"I wore out a pair of these in just shy of two years, so I just ordered another pair. They're great, cozy but not overly hot, comfortable, durable enough to wear outside, soft enough to hang out inside with.... I'd keep wearing my first pair except I blew a couple holes through the sole, the uppers are still just fine. They're not quite OG house slipper corduroy shoes, but they're decent enough to run to the market in real quick, take the dog out, fetch the mail, etc.",Bought my second pair
positive,4.0,"Not too sure yet.  It just arrived in UPS and I immediately turned it inside out because I wanted the white for summer.  Unfortunately this is not truly reversible in the strictest sense of the word.  You see there is the little zip pouch on a leash that clips to the inside of the bag?  All the hooks for clipping it are mounted on the white side of the bag.  Yes, I could clip it to the handle clasps, but then I have these random D-rings sticking out on the white side.  Also, the handles are only black, which is going to look silly with the white side out.  I'd expected the handles to be white on one side and black on the other.  Lastly, there is a 'Made in China' tag sewn down so that when the white side is out, this tag sticks out.  I could cut it off, and if I keep this bag, I will, but am not sure yet.  Initially I was hesitant to pay this price for PVC when there are many other reversible totes that are a lot cheaper, but this one looks dressier overall and that was nice.  Except that with the white side out, the tag, black straps, and D-rings for the inner pouch make it look cheap.

Edited a couple hours later:  those d-rings are for the crossbody strap, and since I have an ivory crossbody strap around here somewhere, I may yet keep this...depends if I can accustom myself to the black short straps.  Note that I had to go to Macy's website to look at pictures and figure this out!",Revised review

positive,5.0,"I was very surprised by this dress! I bought it expecting to not like it, but decided to take a chance anyway. The fabric is very soft. The slit up one side looks a little awkward on me, but I can deal with it. I did have to trim the strings, but that's not a big deal. I tried it on and then washed it before actually wearing it and there were no shrinkage and it's still soft. It's made out of very thin material, so it's perfect for these summer nights coming up!
Also, the shipping took about 2 weeks less than what it was supposed to, so that was nice.

Unfortunately I was having trouble when I had originally ordered the ring and in my haste I didn't realize the size had defaulted back to the smallest size 7 and my husband is a 12. I contacted the seller and they were beyond helpful and understanding and offered to replace the ring with the correct size and even sent me a prepaid shipping label to return the smaller one I received. I received approximately 5 or 6 emails from their representative going above and beyond to insure I was completely satisfied, she even checked for any discounts available to me. My experience with this seller is by far the best example of exemplary customer service I have ever had, I couldn't be more happy with my purchase.

I did receive this product at a discounted price for my honest review.
However for those wondering about trusting reviews from those who received a product at a discount, I don't know how others do it but in the program I'm in, I don't know if the manufacturer even sees our review. I know I am judged on a few things: did I submit a review, was it long enough to be meaningful (a ten word review would count against you), and what percentage of people found it helpful. I have not seen any implication that rating a product well influences my reviewer rating at all. I hope that my reviews are helpful to others, and I would not want anyone to waste their money on account of me misleading them.","Great quality, great price"

Take in my mind these are my daily walker shoes so I'm easily putting about 6-8miles normal walking plus a extra 10-15miles on the treadmill and track a week.  These shoes really impressed me after switching over to the Asics GT2160 which apparently my feet/ankles do not like.  I'll be purchasing another pair here shortly for the rest of my tour just to alternate.,Worth the money
positive,5.0,"I love these flats! They fit well wellother than being slightly narrow, but they broke in over time. However I say that in the fact that I do go a half size up with this brand period.

positive,4.0,"When putting them on the first time, the fabric and sewing construction seem sturdy. I love the generous thickness of these silk socks. On sizing: I purchased a size large sock, which is for women's shoe size 10-13. Depending on the shoe manufacturer, I wear a women's shoe size 9, 9.5 or 10. So, I thought the sock size Large would be a good guess for fit. The are just a little bit too big on my foot, and the elastic band at the calf is a bit snug. I don't have big calves, so these socks may be too tight at the calf for people with larger calves. But, these socks probably won't be slipping down, which is good. I am going to purchase a size medium, and see if the fit is better for my long narrow feet.",the fabric and sewing construction seem sturdy. I love the generous thickness of these silk ...

These shoes are described as suitable for cross training, however they do not provide the proper support for high impact to your feet.

Plus
The shoes are vibrant and colorful. Comfortable for light walking or zumba.  The shoes slide and pivot pretty well (also beneficial for dance or zumba).  They have held up well.  Ive owned this pair almost 3 years.  No blisters.  The shoes sit well below the ankle.  Plenty of room in the toe box.",Not suitable for cross training but great for Zumba or other forms of aerobic dance.

positive,5.0,"I am size 9 in pumps/flats/flip flops and size 10 in sports shoes and I ordered L, they fit just right. Mint colored version is wonderful, shade as expected. Both shoes are the same, so it doesn't matter which one you wear on which foot; this makes them slightly weird in shape but I think that the mint color makes up for that and they look great. I find them to be well made, there are no loose threads or glue left overs nowhere on them. They come in a convenient carry pouch with a loop, that is in exactly same color as the shoes. I did not have any trouble to fold them in half and put them back into their small bag.

This is great item to always have in the car, or with you if you are uncertain about the comfortability of the pumps you are wearing. They cannot be treated as a major to go shoes. They are meant to temporary replace your other shoes. They are super comfortable to walk in, but I generally do like these kind of flats, where I can feel the ground. They are the same quality as similar foldable flats, that you can find in Walgreens in gold/silver/black version. I highly recommend mint color from Riverberry. They look better on my feet in real than on the pictures. They are extremely light and won't be a problem to carry. Remember to go a size down than your usual.

positive,5.0,"I ordered the gray teal Breatho a few months ago. I had only bought the Gobi boots (roomy toe box) and didn't realize that the same size is not the right size for me (toe box) in the Breatho.  I wear thin toe socks with this shoe and can wear the shoes sans socks as well. The shoe fits my feet perfectly and there are no cramped areas at all. I can wear these shoes all day and all night with no issues (except for the length being too close to my toes).  I normally wear a 7.5 and ordered the 6.5 based on the Gobi purchase but for trail shoes and hiking boots with Vivobarefoot, Ive discovered that ordered a size or two up works well for me.

I finally fully rehabilitated both feet of plantar fasciitis without appliances or health provider intervention.  I owe my speedy recovery (after 3 years of enduring the pain) over the last six months to Vivobarefoot:  the design based on the barefoot concept forces my feet to not just sit in a foot coffin, but to work as designed.  My feet are strong (splayed toes!), my ankles are strong, and so are my legs.  My biomechanics have improved 10000% and I couldn't be happier.  I can walk five miles with no problem now and look forward to resuming jogging and running by the end of 2015.

Thanks, Vivobarefoot for awesome footwear!

I have very big calves, so I'm unable to pull it up for the romper look, but that's ok. The main reason why I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the fact that while I was hand washing the pants, a lot of the dye washed out. I'm attaching a photo of the purple colored soapy water in my sink. Definitely HAND WASH these pants and DO NOT put in dryer, as they're quiet delicate, and the colors will run a bit. I'm hoping this will only occur during the first wash. If well taken care of, these are great pants.","Super cute! Be mindfyl when washing, though..."

I usually take a large but ordered the XL b/c I didn't want to be pulling too much on them due to the fabric being more delicate (at least in my mind) than regular stockings. Also the waist doesn't dig into you like some stocking brands do. The only thing I don't like about fishnets in general is that I wish at the top, it wouldn't be netted and instead have a normal panty, but I have yet to find a pair that has this.

positive,5.0,"I've bought several pairs of these Twill Carhartt men's pants for my husband. We started with one pair and he loved them so I've been slowly buying these in the different colors. My husband works at a Military base and needs pants that not only look nice but can also hold up to extensive wear and tear. We've tried may types of pants and jeans over the years and nothing work and looked exactly as he wanted until these. He's a big guy, 6'4"", 250 lbs and built stocky so finding pants that fit aren't an easy thing for him. He laughs when I tell him this but this are such a slimming pant on him! They are also a softer material with a relaxed fit which makes them move really nice for him. But because they are Carhartt they are holding up amazingly! The first pair I bought him 4 months ago still look just a good as the pair I bought last month, highly impressed with the quality and all of the colors are great! This is a pant he can wear on a physical work day with boots, work shirts, etc. yet he can also pair it with a nice dress shirt on days when he has meetings or even for going out after work, very versatile!!

positive,4.0,"I have been looking for an orange bag that was big enough to hold a netbook in a protective case plus throw in a purse and a jacket or lunch bag if needed. Most totes/bags couldn't really fit the netbook in a hard shell case and I wasn't going to abandon the laptop case and leave the laptop exposed to bumps, tosses, etc. Try to throw in anything else and it wasn't going to happen.
I have been looking at this bag for a few weeks and after ordering another orange bag that fell short in size and construction, I bit the bullet and ordered this one.
Yes, there is a bit of an odor out of the box as other reviewers have noted - it isn't horrendous but it is noticeable. I have had it out of the box for 24 hours and it is still there a little - I assume it will fade over time.
It is a little on the heavy side but it is not a thin flimsy material. I prefer to get a thicker bag to hold up to wear and tear.
Construction wise, this is a NICE bag. The zipper top free floats at the end but the stitching to the purse is very strong and will put up with repeated zips. The handles are thick enough to feel secure but not bulky and the handles are double stitched to the bag. I don't do shoulder straps so I can't comment on use of that accessory.
Lining is nice quality, seems well made. I like the inside zipper and the outside zipper option.
The lock on the front is for decoration only. There is a key inside the hanging fob but unlocking it seems to serve no purpose as the bag does not expand or contract. Pretty much the only reason to unlock it was to remove the plastic protection around it...which by the way was a bit of a job considering the plastic went all around the band including through the holes on the side. Unlike another bag I returned with a lock on the front that was very noisy and clangy, this lock makes virtually no noise....another bonus.
Some reviewers noted the bag was 'floppy' and that was a concern for me but this bag does have a flat bottom form and the material is thick enough not to feel this was a drawback. The flat bottom also has 4 metallic nubs to keep the bottom of the bag elevated.
So overall, the money was worth it factoring in color, size and style. The faux ostrich is a nice touch and different. I have already made this my 'go to' back for work so my purse and lunch share the same space without squishing either one. The only reason this is a 4 star and not a 5 is the time you have to wait for the odor to disipate.",Nice bag in fashion color and texture

positive,5.0,"Ok, I just want to say a couple of things about these boots and debunk a couple of Reviewer-Fueled Myths.
These boots are very very tough. I have had mine for 5 1/2 and the leather is holding up like new. As for the myths:

1. The leather is not ""paper thin"" or ""fake"" or even ""cheap"". It is good, thick, quality leather that doesn't crack under pressure like some reviewers seem to say. It holds up to hard wear and stands its ground against stress exquisitely. (Just give it a little time to break in.)
2. The construction isn't shoddy or cheap. One thing about Corcoran is that they wouldn't compromise their long time good rep by pulling any crap with the construction of their boots. I mean, come on! They are made in USA!
Also, they are really comfortable because of the Army Munson Last used in their construction that gives a superior, non-slip fit for the foot as well as the shock-absorbing insole. I wear mine for 10-11 hours EVERY DAY and my feet are quite at bay when I take them off (and I only take them off because I can't wear them to bed.)

That said, what else can one about say about a classic, iconic, well made shoe that was hip 50yrs or so ago, and still is?  Well made, comfortable, and always stylish, good for weddings, funerals, bluejeans and sockless.

positive,5.0,"For the money, this is one of the best running shoes I have ever worn.  They give excellent support, and as has been pointed out, the break-in time is excellent.  I do have several different pairs of running shoes and constantly rotate them, day by day.  The last pair of these I have has a little over 700 miles on them and are wearing quite well.  As has been recommended, you might want to consider a half size down from what you normally wear if you have a narrow foot.  I hate to buy my running shoes without trying them on but took a chance on these and have been quite happy with the results.
I do a lot of trail running mixed with my regular road work, and the shoe performs well in both environments.  They are a nice looking shoe; not too fancy and with out a lot of the whistles and bells you find on so many running shoes today - I like this.

If you are into running big time though, and I probably don't have to tell you this, it is a good idea to have multiple pairs going at once as the shoes need a bit of a rest from time to time.

Overall, I am very happy with these and the pair I owned prieviously.","Good, well built shoes and wears well.  Great price!"

The shoes held up, but the leather curled at the edges and they didn't look as good. So when I was planning my next trip abroad and I saw the H2O boot, which is identical to my old boot but water resistant, I immediately bought a pair. These shoes are comfortable right out of the box -- there's no break in necessary. I'm wearing them as I speak, even though I'm not hiking, just because I like the way they feel.

positive,4.0,"I was so excited when this finally arrived.  It is exactly like it's advertised.  It's pretty sturdy IF, you're real careful to mind a couple of things.
#1.  Pay attention to the Cross. Make sure the clasp that the Cross is affixed with is secure or it'll fall off sometime during you wearing it.  (This happened to me.)
#2.  Watch how wet you get it.  I wore this almost every day, I loved it that much.  However, whenever I washed my hands, I got more and more comfortable with NOT moving it out of the way of the water.  This caused the material to become weak.  So whenever I took it off and put back on, it got looser and looser.  Almost like it was fraying in a very tiny way at sides where you open and close. (Yup, this too happened to me.)
#3.  When taking it off and putting back on, be sure to be careful of how far you open it up because if you open too far, it'll come undone and you'll NEVER get it back together. (Yup, you guessed it, this happened to me too and now I have scrap.  However, I think it's because of more than one factor.  Like because of water AND being in rush to take off.)

Regardless, I still recommend this bracelet.  (I mean, it's barely over $5 with shipping!  AND if you pay heed to my warnings, yours should last longer than mine which was around 2 months.)  I'm ordering another one but Will probably order a couple this time.","Pretty sturdy IF, you mind a couple of  things."

positive,4.0,"I don't know the distinction between boy and girl socks but I got these for my daughter. Size 9 - 2-1/2 fits her perfectly. At the time she was 6 years old and wearing a 1-1/2 big kid shoe (not toddler). She wore these and the Boy's Gold Toe Medium for TWO SCHOOL YEARS - every day to school and with ballet shoes after school. Her foot grew up to a size 3 and she can still wear these socks. This brand stayed white without special cleaning (Gold Toe is kinda off white now). The elastic is great in both...a tad better in this brand. Socks are in good condition - not one needs to be discarded.

Bottom line for me: Great socks re quality, price and durability. I'm getting another bag to use with the others (may look for the next bigger size because she is growing)

***update Aug 2016*** Purchased the 9-11/3-9 for my daughter who wears size 5.5. I've actually down graded my review by one star because this new pack, that comes with colored heels and toes, IS THINNER than the original set. I was putting the new ones in with existing ones and my hands felt difference that my eyes then confirmed. The neck of the socks is not as corrugated; the sole of the socks is thinner. Maybe these are girl socks to go in those preppy shoes. But I ordered the same listed item ""Boy's Socks"" and it even came up saying ""you ordered this item xxxx"". Will see if these hold out but the cushioned feel is no more so I remove star. Not as cotton feel more synthetic feel.

positive,5.0,"Was experiencing pain from alignment problem brought on by shoe insert from other shoes that collapsed under bunion. (Bunion was initially brought on by collapsed shoe insert/insole.)  Chose Merrell Women's Crush Glove Minimalist Cross-Training shoes for ""barefoot,"" minimalist quality and Vibram sole. (Vibram was one of sponsors for 1996 Everest Expedition--high-quality sole.)

So far, shoes are comfortable, no problem with fit or insole. They feel really good, no pain. I like the look of them and definitely recommend them for their minimal padding, insole, and comfort. I am weary and wary of fancy, puffed-up sport shoes with thick soles (or so they appear) and padded inserts made of mystery material. That is the sort of shoe that brought on the bunion.

positive,5.0,"I discovered a little too late that a dress I'd planned on wearing to a formal event taking place in a week, was too small for me. In a panic, I searched for something under $100 that might just fit me. I stumbled across this dress and paid attention to the reviews - a lot of girls were complaining that the top was too large....which meant that it *just* might fit my obscenely large bust (well, it's not obscene...but most dresses make it look that way...!) Perfect.
What concerned me the most was that the dress appeared to have a ""fit-n-flare"" appearance - every dress I've EVER tried on with that mermaid-esque silhouette have turned out to be a big fail for me. I have a pretty big stomach pooch...
Well, it came in the mail today (on time, mind you!) and what did I get? Something beyond my wildest expectations. Not only did it fit me perfectly, everywhere, but that broach! It's so much larger and blingier than the picture!! The zipper, as anticipated, is SUPER flimsy, but the dress isn't skin tight on me, so I think it'll hold just fine. Otherwise I would suggest that immediately upon receiving this dress, taking it to a seamstress to replace the zipper (it's only like $5 or $10...small price to pay for such an amazing dress at an amazing price)!! All this baby needs is a little steam (but I have a feeling that if you didn't have a steamer, tossing it in the dryer would be just fine) and it's good to go!!!

I do wish I'd have invested in a fit-n-flare petticoat to make it flare out a little at the bottom, though... :-P","More amazing than the picture, perfect for a large bust!"

positive,5.0,"I got this to wear as a housedress in hot weather, but I liked it so much that I decided to wear it as a street dress and buy another one to wear around the house.  It's incredibly light and comfortable, and the little lace sleeves are really pretty.  One thing I don't like is that many Sakkas dresses have hems that dip down in the front and back.  I think this looks silly and rather sloppy.  I have the dresses altered so the hem is straight across, and I think it looks much neater and becomes more versatile.",Like this so much I bought another

positive,5.0,"This shirt gets so many compliments. It fits almost true to size. I found it was a little more snug than other mediums I have and the length seemed a bit off.

positive,5.0,"This is my second pair. I've had the first one for years, and use them whenever I'm in cold or windy weather. They are so easy to carry in a pocket, easy to put on, don't give you ""hat hair"", hardly noticeable for anyone with ear-length hair, and very warm. The only difficulty is getting the right size. It's hard to tell from measurements, since ears are somewhat proportionally unique.","Warm, convenient, and effective"

positive,5.0,"I adore big scarves!!! This one is so girly and pretty. The color of purple is brighter than the picture and I still love it!!! There is somewhat of a ""unicorn"" and rainbows type fantasy trend mentality out in the fashion world with holographic make-up and colorful outfits. It has even invaded Starbucks with their ""Unicorn Frappuccino"" which is harder to find than a unicorn. The point I am making is this is a fun way to participate in the trend while loving your basic colors like I do.  I love my LBD and this is perfect to drape  for some flattering color to frame your face across the dinner table. The material is delicate, but not overly so, and sheer. The gold accents in he scarf are golden thread woven into the material. The black feather design is sort of a printed  flocking...its fuzzy. I would imagine one should take great care to wash it. For the cost of this beauty, I believe the cost per wear is actually quite low. Again the color is a brighter purple, very pretty but not as subdued as the picture.  Some designer could come along and buy the lot of them at the factory and attach their name and charge $50.00 per scarf.  This point I am making is be your own creative fashion maven. This scarf also makes you look like a seasoned world traveler finding unique items with which to adorn yourself.    ","""Rainbows and Unicorns""    and this Lovely Vibrant Purple Scarf"

I feel if anything it flattens out my stomach. I am big chested and I like how the line pattern doesn't go all over the place. The one down fall is that it is very see through. I feel if you where nude bra and under where it doesn't show as bad cuz it's harder to tell if it's your skin or not but if you were to where any other color the see through ness will be obvious to anyone. If this dress was lined it would be perfect.,This dress is great. The length is perfect

Not a deal breaker but if the manufacturer could come up with a better system, it would be nice.  The epoxy tubes have a different type of cap that seems to work better.",Effective Product

positive,5.0,"I'm going out of the country soon, and I wanted a pack that would be somewhat tamper resistant. I almost ordered the 20L pack, then read that it has no organizational pockets inside of it at all. So, I ordered this one. I ordered the gray pack, since everything else I have is black. *wish they had the Tabasco one in the 25L.. This is the biggest backpack they have, and it is the same size as a school backpack they have at department stores. Don't expect to pack 3-4 days worth of clothes in here. Maybe you could, if you had NOTHING else. I'm going to put my digital SLR in here, inside of a drysack - then some lite raingear, some sandals, sunscreen, towel, etc etc.. Nothing major. I don't know if this pack is waterproof or not. It feels like it is, but, I'm not going to push my luck. The zippers are very limited on how far they unzip - which is kinda the point. If they went ALL the way down to the bottom of the sack, it would be easier to pry apart I'd think. In the main compartment you can stick a 13 inch laptop into the special little velcro-ed section, and still have a good amount of room to go. In the middle compartment, there are some small velcro pockets, and another good amount of room. Then the outer pocket part, is pretty small, you can diagonally squeeze some maps in there, and maybe a few other really small things. The straps are super comfortable and padded, and the back part of the pack (that touches your back) is super padded too. It has two pockets on the outer sides that you can stick water bottles in also. Very nice bag - doesn't look TOO tourist-y either. The picture makes it look kinda tall and funky - but, it's way smaller than one may think. I can't imagine the 100 series holding more than maybe a sandwich and some AAA batteries.",Great daypack

positive,4.0,"Today I am reviewing the abdominal board support
The item arrived fast and was well packaged.  This item caught my eye after I was browsing for support wear, since I just had a baby and I would really like to at least look like I'm in shape.  So curiosity brought me here and I purchased it.
Upon first inspection I was a little surprised as the board was much smaller than I through the it was.  I am a tad bigger however I as still able to make it work.  The board is pretty stiff and covered with what feels like nylon, like someone took pantyhose and covered it.  That kind of material is actually pretty comfortable to me so I was happy.  The board does fit on the curves really well and actually doesn't show that horribly if you have a good outer support on.  I wouldn't recommend just wearing it with a pencil skirt and underwear as it will show a big outline.  All in all though this board is a good support product I just wish it was a little bigger.
I received this item at a discount or free for my honest and unbiased review.

I love the fit, feel, and color and have received many compliments. They have more support than my other daily work shoes and are also a bit more stylish than the average clog.

I typically wear a size small in everything so I went one size up (not two sizes as many of the reviews said to). I made the right decision, one size up to medium from small worked well. The reason I'm giving this blazer 5 stars is because it has the quality I'd expect for a $20ish blazer. It has no shape to it, it's basically like a shirt.

They are the new popular lace up style without the hassle of having to lace up all the time. Wouldn't have gotten them without the zipper. They remind me of the Clarks Whistle Bea which I thought of getting before I saw these-but these are half the price. I got them a size bigger so I can wear socks with them. Now I have a lot of toe room which I like. Cushion could be a little softer for me so I may add an insert-which the extra room lets me do. The arch seems fairly good which I always look for and need. Overall, great boot, and it's real leather for a great price. Wish they came in more colors. A navy and merlot would be great. I got the brown but to me they look more like a mocha or dark taupe or a browny-grey. But still a great color and I had thought of getting a grey boot so these will work! The leather is very soft and the sole needs no break in time.",Good purchase
positive,4.0,"The wallet itself is made of a nice leather with semi-contrasting stitching. In other words, it's reasonably stylish. You get an pocket for quick access to your favorite credit cards, plus interior pockets for things like insurance, ATM card, etc. There's a visible ID holder.

Cash is carried with a nice metal clip inside the wallet. By far, this system is the best I've ever used, because it lets you not only carry cash, but quickly access whatever bill you want without taking them out of a fold like you would with a money clip. The only possible downside is that everyone will see what cash you're carrying.

The main downside is that this wallet is still bigger than it needs to be. My credit cards and drivers license slide around in their excessively wide slots.

Really a darn good choice for the minimalist who still needs to carry cash, insurance cards, and more than one credit card.",Not bad for a minimal wallet that can still carry cash and plenty of cards.

positive,4.0,"Does not sound like I like them since they don't have much arch support and are only comfortable a couple of hours at a time. But for me, that IS a good fit. For most of my adult life I have had trouble finding shoes I can wear comfortably for any length of time. Tried orthotics, orthopedic shoes, walkers, runners, trainers, flats, rigid soles, flexible soles, bare feet, sandals, flop flops, etc., etc., but nothing is comfortable all day for me. Has only gotten worse as I age. At least these shoes are tolerable for longer periods of time than average, and if I don't STAY on my feet for long periods of time, I can get through a day in them. They do mold to your feet and are light as a feather. Love that you can wash them (no dryer!). I no longer wear dresses or skirts, so can get away with the black ones for most outfits, including some dressier pantsuits. I wish they were a little less expensive, as I don't think they are going to wear as well as I'd like. The navy ones are already fraying around the toe box where fabric meets sole, and I have only had them a month and worn them a dozen times or so.

The outfit does run very small especially the neck. I read the reviews that said order up 2 sizes. I was skeptical ordering a size 3T since he is on the short side and normally wears a size 24 month. But the size 3T fit him perfectly. His waist is about 16 inches. So the waist fit fine. I was able to Button the collar but a 2T would have been too small. The material is a little thin, but it was fine because he had on knee socks. I've added a picture, adorable.","Adorable, but runs small."

The 8 fits perfectly with no room to grow. In the picture, my short/slim son, is wearing the size 10. I had to take the waist in but I prefer the size 10 because he has room to grow.

positive,5.0,"I needed a new bikini for my vacation to San Diego. I saw this one and fell in love. I mean sir mix a lot....come on! Anyways, after reading all the reviews I was super nervous about purchasing due to so many people saying there was a problem with the top. I hesitantly bought it, fearing the worst. It arrived today, right before my trip and I am pleased to say I have never been more happy about something I have bought off amazon. I am 145 pounds, size 34D in the breast department. I purchased the size medium and it fits like a dream. I wouldn't say the top is super tight but it does hold my ladies in place, with just a slight bit of side boob. Nothing to risky. It also gives them a nice little lift. And the slight padding is a plus. I usually don't get high waisted bikinis because I always feel the bottoms look like granny panties, but these bottoms are great, with a bit of cheeekage to make it sexy. I am also impressed with the quality and feel of the fabric. Its more supportive than some people haha. In conclusion this was a major win and I am so happy I found this gem. I highly recommend.",Perfect!

positive,4.0,"Honestly, I like this bag more than my PacSafe bag. I know it says ""World Traveler"" and you're probably like ""lol no way"" but its great for that. Cleans well if you're in a dusty area. Nice little side pockets for water bottles. Fits SO MUCH STUFF even without being bulky. I fit all of my clothes for a month of traveling in this thing (3 pants, 6 shirt, and a jacket). Makes for a fantastic weekend getaway bag, would most likely fit everything you need. Sturdy zippers to close every pocket. The paisley blue is SUPER pretty. Maybe a little darker of a blue in person but not by much.

It is also tall enough to hold bills and credit cards, receipts, etc. without them peeking out of the wallet.  It is thin, which is nice for the pocket.  Overall, I will keep it.  It is probably overpriced, but it's a good quality and internally well made wallet.","Nice Wallet, fits the BILL."

positive,5.0,"The pendant measures a hair over 1.5 inches from tip of petal to tip of  opposite petal in each direction (not counting bale).  The bale is pretty big to accomodate a different chain (and the clasp), not big enough for an omega, though (almost 1/4 inch). I liked the chain that came with it and left it on.  The photo is very accuate, but I like to have a real measurment! The chain is decent, not one of those stock chains you sometimes get that inevitably ends up in knots (you know the type!)  It has larger links on the end to make it adjustable in length.

It is very lovely on your neck or with a turtleneck sweater.  It is almost modern in its simplicity, but feminine, too.  It is slightly convex, not completely flat, which makes it look more like a flower.  I bought it because I wanted it for the holidays (thought it looked like a pointsettia) but I think it will look nice all year long (even in summer since it also looks a little like a hibiscus!)  I would have put a little crystal in the middle, but I tend to like sparkly things :)  Thinking about the earrings to match, but haven't decided yet...it might be too much...maybe something smaller.",beautiful

The shoes run just a but narrow for my foot and by the end of the day my foot feels squeezed and I have to take the shoes off.

positive,5.0,"I recently moved to Denver so I decided it would be nice to get some local merchandise to try and blend in haha. I ordered this shirt in a size XL because I know branded clothing specifically made for women like this seem to always be tight fitting, so I wanted to make sure it wasn't skin tight. I'm a size 14 and this fits me comfortably without being a second skin. The V is a bit deep but nothing scandalous, and the sleeves are about halfway down the elbow. It has a great faded look to it while still being a very vibrant green. I absolutely love the material that it is made out of - it has a very soft and silky feel without being flimsy or too thin. I think it's a great t-shirt to wear out exercising like I did this morning and it doesn't absorb sweat like some other thin shirts can, so it doesn't smell super gross after wearing all day or anything.

positive,5.0,"I've been struggling to find minimalist shoes for my toddler since he outgrew Robeez.  These are pretty close because they are a zero drop shoe (no elevated heel) they have no toe spring built in, and the soles are pretty thin and flexible.  Plus they are cute and stylish.  The leather is very soft and my 23-month-old son loves them.  I have had no issues with him wearing them and he does not trip over them at all as others have mentioned, even though I ordered a size up for growth.  Maybe it's because he's an experienced walker.

This is the first pair of shoes that I have not had to fight to get him to wear in a long time.  He let me put these on him and has worn them every time since with no argument.  They seem very comfortable and have a nice wide toe box.  He usually wears wide or extra-wide shoes and these are perfect width.  I am very pleased with them.  I'll be sad when we outgrow this line.  Their Kai shoes are not flexible at all.

I can't say how durable they will prove to be, but we've had great luck with SKR shoes in the past so I have high hopes they will last us the summer.

Update 9-9-14
My son wore these all summer and they got pretty beat up.  But he loved them.  Never complained once about wearing them.  I don't think they run big at all, since he just outgrew them measuring a little over a 7, and ours are 7's.  The soft leather is wonderful for comfort but does not hold up to rough play on cement.  They were still worth the money, just don't expect them to last more than 4-5 months.",Perfect

positive,4.0,"I was cautiously optimistic about these ankle boots--love the style and price.  The problem, and it's mine, not the boot, is that I sometimes wear a size 6.5 and other times need a size 7, so just have to take my best guess when ordering online.

The size 7 fit my left foot, but was way too loose in the right foot.  Other reviewers have said the boot runs true to size, and I'd have to agree with the caveat that if you're a true 7 in both feet, these would likely fit.

That said, my adult daughter loved these boots and wanted to try them on before I returned them.  She sometimes wears a size 7 and other times needs 7.5.  The size 7 was a little tight for her, so we ordered a size 7.5 in the burgundy for her and she is thrilled with her boots...perfect fit.

A word about width...these boots, unlike a lot of boots, will accommodate a wider foot comfortably because they have 'give'...the faux suede stretches and is not stiff, even around the ankle.  The wedge keeps your foot from being forced into an uncomfortable angle.

I really wish I could have made these boots work because they are very attractive, decent quality and reasonably priced.  And, according to my daughter, when they fit properly, very comfortable.",These Boots Actually Were Made For Walking

I attempted to return them but Amazon would not allow me to exchange and said my size/color combo was unavailable - although when I followed the link from my recent purchases the item showed as available.  Eventually I gave up and returned my shoes to shoe carnival where I was given a refund and able to purchase the same pair from there.

This black wing-tip is no-fuss.  I would not wear it to be married in.  The crepe soles just a trifle casual.  Would not wear it to a funeral, for the same reasons.

But for ""casual Friday"" and semi-dress, a black wing-tip that straddles the line between between ""formal"" and ""casual"" has a great many uses.

positive,4.0,"This is not a bracelet to be worn with lots of other bangles and 'busy' charm bracelets.  No, this delicate and demure piece of jewelry is too low-key and quiet for that; it would simply get lost in the clamor.  This 7.25"" bracelet is quite highly magnified in the product page photograph, but it does give you a clear picture of the elephant figure where all the garnets are clustered and the open links along the sides and back which keep the bracelet very light in weight.  The designs on either side of the elephant are not stones, but engravings which give the impression of stones to add some light-catching properties to the basic design.  At its widest point the elephant is approximately .25"" wide.  The closure is a satisfyingly strong push/snap with a second security feature that clicks down to keep the main closure from coming open.  This is a bracelet I can put on my wrist and not even think about taking off until I want to change the style of jewelry for the day.  I can write and type without having the bracelet interfere or get in the way.

I think the length of this bracelet might be a big factor in whether or not a young tween or teen could wear this.  It easily slips down past my wrist bone onto my hand (without any possibility of falling off my hand) so a young girl might have trouble keeping this size bracelet on her hand.  The elephant and garnet stones could satisfy a lot of different collection categories for the wearer so this would appeal to a wide variety of tastes in jewelry.  If you are considering this bracelet as a gift, mine came in a very sturdy outer black box with an interior marine blue lining.  The bracelet box is also smooth and black with a black soft interior and a blue ribbon to help with pulling it open.  The box is hinged with strong, concealed springs.  The box is probably a little big and I would have described it more as a box for a necklace, but quite a nice box nevertheless.","Charming, delicate and demure."

I love the smell of leather.

The bracelet is good for dress up, Theme days or just a Goth teenager.  Its leather and has 3 positions that It can be closed in.  The pirate charms are each riveted on with one rivet each so they are not going to go anywhere.  The end with the snap is rounded off so it gives it a more finished look. They also did stitching all the way around it to help finish it off.  Now the pirate charms while they are riveted on, they can spin around so this could be good or bad depending on your preference.  The leather itself is a bit stiff but its new so it should relax once its broken in just like new boots.

I uploaded a small video of it to show it off a little better.  Ive attached pictures of the product I received below.

If you have any question please don't hesitate to ask. Ill be more than happy to help answer any question if I can.

She became very frightened and her robe opened a little bit (don't worry, I got an eyeful - wink!). I proceeded to go into her room and as I was saying ""No sign of him, ma'am"" I turned around and there she was -- sans robe!

Well, there was an embrace and then we were somewhere where time just stopped and we held each other tightly and confidently.

positive,5.0,"On Black Friday 2016, I ordered my first pair of New Balance shoes in a long time (after being disappointed in the last few that I'd bought years ago).  I ordered them specifically because they said that they were made in the USA...but it turns out that they weren't.  I was pretty upset about being duped, but that aside, they weren't very good shoes with poor fitting insoles that cost (at the time) about what these do.  Not a good impression and made me think back to why I stopped buying them in the first place.  Those got two stars.  Their price has dropped to about half of these now, though, probably because of being so bad.

I decided to give New Balance one more try and ordered a pair of these - and these are fantastic!  These running shoes are so much nicer than that pair from Black Friday.  These are comfortable and seem to be very well made.  Definitely a five-star shoes, IMO, for the current ~$60 price tag.

The soles give good grip on both paved surfaces and more rocky trails, and there's very good support inside.  I will admit that I did not like the feel around my heels at first because it felt like the shoes were curved upwards at the back end and not flat when I'd walk...sorry, hard to describe, but imagine walking in a curved shoe (like a banana) and not a flat one.  After about five minutes, though, I started to really like that type of support.  I use these for walking more than running, but I think the support in these would be good if you're a heel striker.

I haven't worn them long enough to know how well they'll hold up over time and bad weather.  The outer material doesn't appear especially rugged, and the meshed portions are the type of materials that is prone to picking up seeds from dried grasses and weeds when (which are prevalent around here on less traveled trails).  At least for drier days and trails this time of year when there's less vegetation, these have been great for me.  I don't mean to convey that these are flimsy on the outside - not at all.  For trail shoes, though, I think that they'll show wear and tear fairly quickly especially if you wear them in wet weather (but I don't know for sure).

I won't say that these have won me back over to the New Balance brand, but they're a big step in the right direction.  These remind me of the ""good old days"" when I exclusively bought New Balance and loved them.",Remind me of why I used to love New Balance

I'm not horribly obese, but definitely one who needs to lose at least 40 lbs. So when I ordered this I was ELATED to see that it fit.  Typically I have to cut the lining in these types of jackets because it's always too tight on my arms and my shoulders. I used to body build and then was hurt and cannot work out like I used to, so I have fat on top of muscle which makes me pretty thick across the chest and back. I'm a true 36D, but my chest is about a 39 or 40. The jacket buttons perfectly! The color is definitely the perfect shade of lavender and one of those pieces I'll have forever.

My ring finger is a size 6, index 7, and wrist is 6 1/2"" these are perfect size but due to the stretch I do think they will accomidate larger hands as well.

Tough and lasts forever, compared to other similar shoes.  They are sturdy, but breathe, and the light up and dinosaur a plus for any little boy!","They are sturdy, but breathe"

positive,4.0,"just the right kind of robe, not heavy and hot.",great robe for price
positive,4.0,"The drop-down only gave me certain choices about the fit, and it didn't give me the choice of too small and too big.  The nude bra fit fine at first, but the straps were falling down by noon.  I'm sloped-shouldered, so I don't blame the bra.  I should have stuck with the 2X size, but its cups are too small for the girls.  It's not the fault of the product.

Then I tried to put on the black bra.  I thought I was going to have to call the fire department to extricate me. I got stuck with part of it under my left armpit and the other part across my face so they wouldn't have understood me if I did call to tell them I'm trapped by a sports bra and don't want to be found dead this way.  I finally got it off, stretched the band several times with my hands to loosen it, tried to put it on again, gave up out of exhaustion and went back to bed.  I'll wait until a four-day weekend during a time when I have health insurance to try again.  I'll unlock the front door and dial 911 so I'll only have to push send.

Seriously,  I've liked these bras in the past which is why I bought more, but I think the black one is sized incorrectly.  Anyone need a very large slingshot?",One is too small and one is fine
positive,5.0,"This is a JR size, not women's. However, I love it!!!!! It is my new favorite sweater and I am ordering multiple colors. It's a wardrobe staple. I wear a women's medium, so I just ordered a large and it fits perfectly.",Highly recommended! Just order a size up from your woman's size.
positive,4.0,"I have loved the essie line of nail polish for years just for their sheer, wearable colors which go well-beyond their cult classic, ballet slippers. I was curious to see if this gel polish could be as a good as the gel manicures available in salons. My conclusion: It's very close. The pros: This polish goes on smoothly and dries so quickly. The special oval-like brush gives excellent results. The gel top coat has a strong smell, but it does leave my nails looking like they have just been polished. Usually two days in there is a slight dullness and even some chipping, but I have seen none of that. I got this as a freebie, but I would gladly buy this. It's a great way to get a salon-like manicure in 15 minutes of actual polishing time. (And I didn't use anything to speed up the process.)","Nice, long-wearing nail polish"

positive,5.0,Their is nothing wrong these tights panty hose unfortunately I am tall but not large or overweight.  Because of my height I have to purchase the larger sizes which end up too big for me due to my weight being on the smaller size.

I have a few pairs of boots, but boots for ladies never have a good tread on them. These boots have great treads for keeping you on your feet in snow and ice. They don't exactly look like the picture, there's a more rounded toe and it's not nearly as sneaker-like as the image portrays. Boot is kind of big and chunky, but it's full of insulation to keep your feet warm, so I can't complain. Happy I bought them.",Comfy and do a great job!

positive,5.0,"I absolutely love this hat. Over the last two or three years, I've purchased 7 or 8 Bailey Fedora's from Amazon. All of them are much better quality than any of the other brands I've purchased on Amazon or on E-Bay. In the fall and winter, Bailey's Lite Felt Fedora's are great; however, in the spring and summer, Bailey's Straw Fedora's are the best Fedoras on the market. They are cool, stylish, lightweight and extremely comfortable to wear here in Southern California. The fit is true size. They are very well made from high quality materials. My straw Fedora's haven't stained and they regain their original shape quickly after they are unpacked. Without question, they are the best hat for the money on Amazon.",I love Fedora's

positive,5.0,This corset saved my life!!!!!!!!!!!!  I was going on a date with my boyfriend and wanted to spice up things a little bit wanted to surprise him with something sexy but at the same time classy and with lots of taste.  The way this corset is made of is extremely well made and the support on the sides makes the waist seem small.  The purple color in specific areas of the corset is not to much which is a plus.  The corset is adjustable in the back which allows you to cinch it to your preference.  The black tutu is short and covers enough skin to leave some things to the imagination of your man.  The bust part fits as expected and your boobs don't look like they are going to burst out the corset.  I recommend this corset to have an unforgettable date night.  Also this will fit perfectly as a Halloween costume.  I received this product with a discounted price in exchange of my honest and unbiased opinion,For an unforgettable night

positive,5.0,"I think these run a little smaller than normal especially in the width portion. I usually wear a little bit wider shoe and these didn't fit me at all but they did fit my daughter who wears a medium width.  I can wear a medium width in some but definitely not these.  The soles are thick but flexible. The inside has twill lining and it makes the shoes cooler than a lot of them are, plus the outside holes helps with that. I like that part best although they might not be too great in rain. The shoes are flat and don't have much of an arch so if you need arch support, you may not be too happy with them. The insoles are not gel or memory foam like I am used to so I wouldn't have been too happy with them if they had fit me. Also they are low in back which I'm not fond of. My daughter really likes them though. I am thinking they are more for the younger set since she liked everything that I didn't care for. They look durable and have great stitching in them. I'm not sure they can be put in washer since the insole isn't removable so I think they can only be spot cleaned and air dried. They are very white and attractive looking on the feet and would look great with a tanned leg. Keds has been around since 1916 so they know what they are doing.

Some little details: the drawstring is made of the same fabric as the pants themselves, so it's extremely hard to tie them without making a weird bulge under your shirt.

If you want perfect jewelry-store pearls, you need to shell out the money for saltwater pearls.

positive,4.0,"When I bought these shoes, I was looking for something to wear for a Halloween costume. I needed the shoe to be the light pink color, and as you can imagine there are not a lot of light pink sneakers out there that do not cost and arm and a leg. These shoes perfectly fit the costume and for something that you are only going to wear for a couple of hours at a time, these served the purpose. They are definitely a basic shoe, no frills. Do not expect to wear these comfortably all day unless you have some good shoe inserts. I do not wear a wide style shoe normally but my feet are on the wider side and after a few hours of wearing these, I could definitely feel some rubbing on the outsides of the balls of my feet. I will probably not wear these again unless needed for another costume or special event where I need the light pink shoes, but compared to buying actual costume shoes, which will run you no less than $30 - $40 dollars at costume stores; these were a steal on the price.",Great for costume matching

positive,4.0,"About me:

Im 53, 160 pounds.  Im an upside down triangle (big breasted with more fat on the arms and back) and smaller waist and athletic legs.  On my fat days, Im a 38 D. Im 40 years old but age doesnt matter, right?!

What I needed: I struggle to find control for the girls and need my back to be smoothed out because I hate it when I get rolls when I wear any type of bra  even if Im fitted properlyI get rolls above and below my bra line, UGH!!!

I also was not looking for a girdle-type affect.  I wasn't expecting to go down in sizes  just want smoothness and firm control. I find it hilarious that some of the comments here were expecting such.

It is so very difficult to find the perfect body shaper but honestly, without trying it on, it is a hit or miss.  Here is what I found for myself

The cup size is perfect and true to size. It has some padding (not of the heavy variety) but being that my GIRLS are already on the WOW side, less padding is best for me. However, it does the extra padding gives them a nice soft shape and lift.

The fabric is soft to the touch.  I stepped into the body shaper expecting to wrestle my way in it  I even prayed a bit before pulling it up but surprisingly, it went up nicely.  Of course, lots of pinching and pulling here and there until I got it over my butt, stomach, and boobs but I didn't curse my way into it or break a nail. And it didn't take over 5 minutes to fully adjust everything. I looked in the mirror and saw that it did smooth everything out including my back. It didn't give the double boob look either. The stomach area does have a double liner so there IS CONTROL. For those saying ""it's not holding my stomach in"", gurl...it didn't suck or flatten mine either; you are round and bodacious that's all. This garment smoooooths you out and works with what YOU have.

The crotch area didn't give me issues and is comfortable to wear. It does have several hook options for height adjustment but If you are very tall (umm over 58/ 59 or above) there might be issues because I played around with it and it didn't make such a huge difference.

So I give it 4 stars because I really like it.  It didn't wow me nor is it the best I've ever had. For me, this one is good...not perfect, but good. It is well made, the cups fit nicely with relatively good coverage and a light lining in the cup. The legs are not cut as high as I like, but the flat fabric at the leg does not leave a panty line, so they are fine. It smooths me out everywhere I wanted it to and is comfortable to wear all day so it's doing it's job nicely.

I ordered both the tan and black one. Im glad it fit nicely and didn't have to return both of them.  If you do need to return them. They offer free returns, which is great otherwise I wouldnt have ordered.

The colors aren't *exactly* like the photo, the ""Winchester"" text is more of an orange than the glowing red, but it still looks nice though, a hat with this ""weathered"" look wouldn't have that bright of a red anyways.

 What Do You Get?  1 Umbrella and cover case
 Did I like this?  Yes
 Why?  This is a nice little on the go umbrella. It only takes one push of a button it opens quickly and easily. When you press the button again it collapses so you can push it back down.  It is comfortable to hold, but I wish the handle was a little bit longer.  The stitching is good and the material seems strong.  The price is very competitive and is inline with others along this line. I would recommend this and would definitely buy again.

positive,5.0,"What can I say about this Invicta. I've always been a fan of the Rolex Submariner. But I never really purchased one because of size. I believe they are only 40mm. My wrist minimum size is a 44mm. Any less I feel is too small. I came across this unique Pro Diver in that its a 47mm. Very Rolex like and I like that fact that it has the coin bezel over the scalloped bezel. I was eyeing the black version but because of the rarity of the 47mm I was not able to find one. I did come across this only one in the blue and gold. And you know what..., I'm actually glad I did. I get so many compliments on this watch and it actually looks good on the wrist. Very eye popping! I couldn't be happier. The second hand isn't as smooth as my other automatics but you can't really complain. The bracelet is smooth and the double clasp works great! If you're looking to get their standard (40mm) Pro Divers, I highly recommend it. Build is great and you will not be disappointed.

positive,5.0,"This is the fourth Panache bra I have purchased from Amazon. I am a 34I US size and a 34G UK size. This bra is sold using the UK size

I've had this bra for a few months now and I love it. The fit is snug (as it should be), but feels a bit tight at first. It ""relaxes"" after the first few wears and become comfortable enough that I don't know it's there. This bra looks smooth under clothing; if you wear super tight clothes you may see the front seam. I've not had this problem and I wear thin form fitted tee-shirts quite often. The bra is not padded at all and is very thin and light weight. My breasts look perky and well supported. The only draw back is they sit a little far apart. Under clothing, it doesn't look bad. The cups are stretchy on the top edge and fit me a bit loosely. The top portion of the cup is also sheer and, in my opinion, not very sexy; my boy friend thinks otherwise. The bra also holds its shape and support after washing. I wash it in a garment bag with my other laundry and lay it flat to dry. Overall, this is a great bra that I wear often. It is well constructed and fits nicely.

A Note On Bra Sizes: Most of the negative reviews about this bra seem to be concerning the fit. The key to this bra and Panache bra's in general is finding your correct size. I never had a bra fit correctly until a year ago (I'm 35). I finally used the ""don't wear a bra, lie on your back (or bend forward from the waist), and measure!"" method. I went from a 34DDD to a 34I. The sales lady at a high end department store laughed at me when I told her the size I wanted/needed to try on; she said that wasn't a real size. Thank goodness for Amazon! I went home and ordered one the same day. I almost cried with joy when I put on my correct size; the gore sat against my chest the way it's supposed to and I didn't have spillage on the sides or top. I hope this bit of advice works as well for you as it did for me! Plus, Panache has some very pretty styles for larger sizes!","Wonderful Bra, if you have your Correct Size."

This isn't a suit that you can pass off as a pair of shorts, if the sign says no swim suits, this one is not allowed either.

Since my purchase of the corset, I have been able to lace it all the way down almost with only 1/2 an inch  of lacing space in the back. My waist has been reduced to a pleasant 27 inches while not wearing the corset. Very happy with my purchase and results so far.

The quality of it is very high and the material is nice. I have had no problems with it breaking or messing up. The structure is very sturdy but it will also morph to your body. It becomes very comfortable once you get use to wearing it. I would personally recommend buying a corset that's between 4-6 sizes below your current waist size. If you get one that is only 2 inches below your current waist; you won't see much results and more likely will have to be another one once you master it.",Great Corset.

positive,5.0,"I'm generally extremely skeptical of buying things that are one size fits all or don't have a specific size listed because most clothes are loose on me. After reading several reviews, I decided to give it a shot and get a pair of the green army camouflage leggings. Normally I get XS to S sizes when it comes to clothes. I'm 5' 4"" and 115 lbs. Small butt, small frame. These leggings actually fit amazingly well (length and size), and suspect that for people who want a larger size or taller height, the material will easily stretch to fit. I love the material. I wear these leggings much more than I originally thought I would because they're so comfortable. The one thing I would like to point out is that for those of you that get cold easily, like me, these leggings are not suited for freezing temperatures, but are rather suited for spring/fall weather.",the material will easily stretch to fit

Feels fine on the skin, and mine is sensitive. Wrinkles due to shipping fell out overnight once on hangers. I love the quality. The shirt seams/buttons are well sewn.  A replacement button is provided - what a nice feature. Wash instructions - machine wash, cold water, delicate cycle; with like colors; no bleach. Tumble dry cool. Warm iron if needed.  I won't trust color fastness until I test in first wash. I marked as running somewhat small because the XL fits me perfectly, and I'm 5'2"", stocky (155 lb, 42 in bust).

positive,5.0,"When offered these leggings in exchange for an honest review, I was delighted with the vendor's permission to turn them over to my wife for evaluation.  She wrote the following assessment:

""After last years winter with polar vortex subzero weather, I have become a true fan of leggings. These thermal leggings don't disappoint; they are lightweight, attractive, stretch, comfortable, easily washed and fit great. I especially like the design on the waist which is quasi yoga pant-like but much more sophisticated looking.

""Recently I wore these leggings on a cold day without layering pants over them and was surprised that the leggings were just as effective as my other leggings with pants. This allows me to do more hiking without the sweat and freeze cycle of my other leggings. Instead of absolutely dreading winter like I usually do, I am looking forward to testing these leggings further as the winter cold unfolds.""",True Comfort as Winter Cold Rolls In

positive,5.0,"These are solid shoes; extremely light. They are truly racing flats and as such, I find them pretty fast for distances of 10K or less. I've occasionally worn them for runs up to 8 miles or so, but as my feet are not conditioned for long runs in flats, I wouldn't go much over this.

Mine have held up very well for the first 200 miles. I don't know if I'll get 500+ out of these like I typically do with the Wave Riders, but I only wear these about every third run so I can stretch them out for at least a year. In fact, I'm about to retire a pair of Wave Riders and replace with these flats to get my rotation to two pairs of WRs and two pairs of these flats.

Overall I'm very satisfied with these shoes. I just wish they weren't in such funky colors. The blue and green look good, but the others... ugh, not so much. Of course, that's a cosmetic gripe, not a functional one.",Great shoes for distances less than 10K

This suit is well made and for the price I am amazed at how nice it is. I wish the straps were removable but I may just cut them off altogether. The top stays up just fine without them.

I am normally a size 8-10 and I ordered the xxl based on the size chart and reviews. The top fit fine but the bottoms are a little snug. I love that they provide full coverage while not being high wasted or old lady looking. After losing a few pounds they will be fine. The top is my favorite part anyway and mainly the reason why I chose this suit.

While they do not detract from my 5-star rating, I have two caveats.  First, this really is a lace-up boot, so it takes a little extra time to get into and out of them.  The other is that they fit great if I'm wearing nylons, but not with heavier stockings.",A very comfortable shoe for walking.

Very often, the jackets from other brands felt larger than expected but not this one. The quality of materials and constructions are above average.  Other than the 4 functional outside pockets, there are 1 inner one with zipper on left and one large open one on right.  There are also 2 hand-warmer pockets.  The nice touch is the inner collar made of acrylic so your neck won't feel scratchy if you are sensitive to wool.  The jacket is super warm, fully lined and just the right length like a car or barn coat.  The zipper also works all the way up to collar for extra warmth.

Also the listing photo showing the scarf flat might be a bit misleading - it is actually that scene doubled & reversed to reach the 60"" length (see pic). It is a nice scarf, decent quality and fun for art lovers - I have a Kandinsky one from the same company too (not shown in this listing at this time).

positive,5.0,"36 DD - 56 and 125 lbs - Purchased Large in White. Perfect fit!

When searching for something that would be both classy and functional for an outdoor wedding, I was paranoid beyond reason having to shop online! I simply don't have the time to run to 30 different stores to find what Im looking for (especially if its not in season) so I grit my teeth, read reviews, and took the plunge on this beautiful bolero/shrug. I was so incredibly pleased with this item it was hard to believe they were asking as little as they were! I have no negatives so Im just going to bullet-point all the goodies.

* I ordered a large since I was breastfeeding constantly at the time and was afraid it was going to curl at the armpit, but it didnt! I wore it over a sleeveless dress - another happy Amazon purchase - and it provided exactly the coverage needed to keep covered and not sweat in the 90 degree heat. Honestly shocked that it was so breathable given its material. Had five people ask me where I got it and figured it was a $100 shrug.

* Washes well in cool/delicate, and I threw it in dryer on delicate with no issues.

* Fits both me and my daughter, who has since stolen it, and shes only 53 and 95 lbs. She is obviously the one in the pics, and though its baggy on her she rocks it in a tank top! I still wear it when I can wrestle it from her bony little fingers.

* Fabric is pretty stretchy, so if you're not supremely picky about fit, just use bust measurement since the back and arm lengths don't vary much between sizes.

* SEE PHOTOS: Shoulder to shoulder on Large is around 17 (didnt see that listed in description and that matters to me) and arms are true to post at 24 on the nose.

Overall, a highly advisable purchase, ESPECIALLY since its made in the USA! At this price and quality, I don't know how they do it. But don't raise the price because Im buying more as gifts!!!

They are true to size, very comfy, and the buckles on the toe make your foot appear smaller along with being a cute detail. I bought the wider calf because of my muscular legs, my calf is 15.5"" and this said it's 17"", making a perfect 1.5 inch extra gap (in jeans) so they don't look tight.  I have a narrow foot, and the width in the foot bed is perfect for me, so I'd say they're not wide in the foot area, just the calf. My only complaint and reason for 4 stars is the chemical smell from the fake leather. But I've had boots with this smell before and it goes away, I would recommend putting them outside to air out before wearing, as the smell can be strong at first. But.. you get what you pay for, and I knew they weren't leather and expected it. They seem well made, the sole doesn't slide on the floor when you walk, and they look and feel like real leather, so I'm happy with them! :)",Absolutely Adorable and Comfortable! New smell a bit strong though...

positive,5.0,"By the time I found these on Amazon I was a little scared about buying them. I recently moved to an area that gets snow, so I needed to get good waterproof gloves. Trouble was none of the pairs in stores were large enough, even though size-wise they should have been. I was afraid that I'd have to spend more money than I wanted to for ones that fit. I tried these on the first time and they were tight, so imagine my disappointment! But I worked the fleece into the fingers a little, put them on/ took them off a few times and they started to feel better. Now they fit like, well, a glove! They're great for snow and keep my hands warm and dry. Plus, they're touch-screen gloves so I can use my phone for taking pictures without removing them!

positive,5.0,"I love these shoes! Ever since the hype years ago about aligning the bones, etc. I bought into the hype because of my bunion and how most shoes hurt my feet. When it was proved/disproved that the shoes do/don't do what they claim, I still liked the shoe. They're comfortable; my bunion doesn't hurt; I have protection for my feet while still feeling I'm barefoot. Way back in the 80's I used to run barefoot cross-country and these shoes kinda bring back some of that feeling. The very first day they're weird getting on, but after that, they slip on just like any other shoe or sandal. Some people have talked to me about not liking a feeling of something between your toes, but I really haven't noticed any discomfort in that regard. I workout at the gym in these shoes too.

What I'm not happy about is I poked a hole in the fabric with my finger when pulling it down.  After that, became extra careful.  Handwashing and line dry was easy.

positive,4.0,"This watch is nice for either gender due to the neutral colors. The black band on it is a thin leather material that was comfortable on, while the face of the watch is a pure white. They contrast very nicely.

My husband ended up wearing this watch as when I tried it I felt the face of the watch was too big for me (I have smaller wrists about 4-5"" circumference).

The watch for him, looked nice on him And fit comfortably on. He loved how it looked and got numerous compliments on it at work. The only thing he wished was a little better is the band, he feels the band is a little stiff, I'm thinking it'll get better with wear though since that's usually how leather is.

This watch also comes in a super nice box with a gift bag so it's ready for gifting if you're purchasing it as a present.

I bought him a 6. Wasn't too big. Wasn't too small. Fits him PERFECTLY. With a little room to grow. He pulled it out of the box and put it on and wore it around the house.

positive,5.0,"Considering the price, this set is incredible! I bought 2 sets and my 2 sons really liked playing with them. My 8-year-old lost interest relatively quickly, but my 3 year old keeps playing with the various pieces. The hat is a nice quality hard plastic. It is a little small, I think, but fits my 3.5 year old's head fine. Due to being a little small, it has a tendency to fall off, but he's fine with that. All of the pieces are surprisingly good quality, especially considering the price. Even the eye patch is a nice thick plastic...I thought it would be cheap cloth like other pirate sets. The treasure box is a little silly because it doesn't open and pretty much looks like a bath toy, but my boys and I created a game where I would hide the chests around the house and I drew them a blueprint of our house, marking with Xs where the treasure were. The kids LOVED this activity..even my 8 year old found it amusing. He tired of the game more quickly than my 3 year old, but would help his brother when he was stuck because he can read the room names and the little one can't yet. I may have to create a house map with icons for the various rooms instead of text. Anyway, I think this is an incredible deal. I would consider picking up a set or two more to donate or as gifts.","Great deal, surprisingly good quality"

positive,5.0,"Chuck says: When an elderly relative wants to celebrate your birthday with a gift of a ""good pair of shoes"", I find it imperative to ensure you are very specific about what brand and what exact style they should get you.  This is how I came to own my Clarks Unstructured Un. Ravel oxfords.  I did my research and realized that I did not want to be frivolous with the choice (or their money), but wanted to get a great pair of shoes that will last me for years.  In my low 50's, I am challenged with finding comfortable shoes for work or play, mostly due to a right foot that is a bit bigger and more sensitive than the left.  I have a couple of well loved Johnston & Murphy pairs for work, but they are too dressy for casual wear.  I have always heard that Clarks are very comfortable, and decided to try them myself.  Honestly I let the ratings steer me to these Un. Ravel's, and the pictures of the inside and footbed enticed me with potential comfort- so I picked them.  They are not a typical sleek and shiny dress shoe, but are appropriate for all but the most dressy affairs.  I will say the picture makes them look more clunkish than they really are.  Styling is nice to talk about but what I really cared about is How Do They Fit?  The answer is ""Very Comfy, thank you"".  Good leather on the outside, good leather and foam on the inside, Vibram on the sole.  I wore them all day the first day (about 12 hours of managing by walking around, which was just asking for trouble...).  To my great relief, they were very comfortable all day.  The tongue and laces are higher up than my other shoes, and were the only reminder that I was wearing new shoes.  Once I changed the lacing to omit the top eyelets, I was extremely comfortable.  90 days later, they feel great either way.
  Now 3 months later I am still very happy with these great fitting and comfortable shoes.  Other reviews indicated that they run a bit larger than standard sizes, so I took that into consideration.  I did not order a size smaller than usual but just expected them to be a bit loose.  They are an ideal fit for me and have encouraged me to try other Clarks styles in the future.",Ruggedly handsome and plush comfy for all day wear at the office or about town.

positive,5.0,"Just back to order 4 more of these bras.  I've been wearing a different style Bali wirefree bra for several years.  Several years of my life wasted!!!  Only sort of kidding. I never thought this bra would offer enough support but it does and it is so comfortable, plus it has just the right amount of padding to keep everything discreet while still being very lightweight.  Also, it's a great price (for the light beige lace one, anyway, at least today).  One more thing: It does create somewhat a unibreast in front (never had a wirefee bra that didn't), so it doesn't really separate well, but it seems to me to do a good job of keeping everything out front, instead of it pushing back into the arm pit area, which seems pretty miraculous for a bra with no underwire.
I hope they hold up to the, uh, strain, since there is no adjustment in the straps.  I got the 40D = XL and the fit is fine.",Back for more of these bras!

I'm 6'1"" and they're just to the bottom of my knee cap, if I squat they don't hang up on my knees but standing they cover just barely. Sitting they rise just above. Very comfortable, although guys with larger thieghs may find them a little tight. The only thing I really think is cheesy is the false draw string in the bottom of the leg. I'll be cutting these off as it's just a little tag of material sewn in. There isn't an actual draw string in the leg bottoms, thus these are to suit the style the designer was shooting for without making the budget any larger, plus the occasional tickle on my knees drives me crazy.",Nice shorts

My biggest complaint is the zipper- it seems like it's going to fall off really soon. That's the main reason for the star being knocked off. I hope I'm surprised, but we'll see.

My other complaint is that the soles are not very flexible. This is typical of some boots, but it might not be good on the ice...again, we'll see.

positive,5.0,"I got these for free to try and review; regardless this is mine and my daughters 100% honest opinion. I love sunglasses but can't wear them much anymore because of wearing glasses and inability to wear contacts due to my allergies. I got these sunglasses for my teenage daughter who is starting to get into the same habit I was of collecting sunglasses and swapping them out depending on her outfits and moods. She really likes how lightweight these are, they fit comfortably and do not pinch or cause headaches. The style of the frame is fun and she likes the retro feel of it and they look cute on her face too! The shape might not be for everyone but she can definitely pull them off. The lenses are tinted dark and they do help to keep the suns glare out of her eyes when she is out and about. We live in Northern California and she walks around town a lot and needs the extra protection from the sun. The price point on these are excellent and as a mom I have no worries if the teen or one of her friends accidentally destroys them, which does and will happen. She really liked that they came with a soft microfiber draw string bag to help keep them clean and dust free when she is not wearing them, though it's not hard and will not protect them from getting crushed or broken.","Stylish frames, dark lenses."

If I weight around 135 these would be great.  I will be ordering these in a size 10 for keeps. Great color.","Great material, just a ""little"" too snug around the ..."

positive,4.0,"We picked this luggage up when we saw it on special on Amazon.  Overall, we're very happy with the purchase.

* The rollers were our main reason for purchasing these.  Our old luggage had ""inline"" rollers, so you had to tilt it to roll it around the airport.  The spinner wheels on this Samsonite luggage allows us to roll it around in an upright position.  One item to note: when I travel for only a few days, I use the smaller piece, and have noticed that the center of gravity is high enough that it sometimes wants to tip over when rolling it around upright.  A small inconvenience.

* The hard sides were also attractive to us.  Although the sides may look like the are metallic, they are actually made of a plastic.  It appears to be quite durable, so there is little chance any thing will poke through it to damage the contents of the suitcases.  On the other hand, it scratches easily (when I dropped the smaller bag into the ""you have to check your bag if it is bigger than this"" baggage sizer in the airport, I pulled it out to see that the plastic had already been scratched).  So I expect these bags to start looking ""tired out"" after a few trips - we don't mind that, but if you do, then you may be disappointed with these.

* The bags store nicely - with the smaller bag fitting directly into the larger one.

Overall, I recommend these.  They are durable and comfortable to move around in an airport, and at a reasonable price.","Solid, Lightweight and Easy to Manage Bags"
positive,5.0,"They are so so so so comfortable.  They run a little wide, but it doesn't matter, the fit is well worth the wear!  The only thing I don't like is the white around the edges, so I found some other Skechers dressier styles to wear when dressing casual.  I haven't received them yet.  I'm totally sold on Skechers!",Best shoes you'll ever own!

positive,5.0,"I am a college student, and I was looking for casual/warmer (but still cute) shirts to wear with hi-waisted jeans. This shirt is perfect! I literally wear it almost every weekend to concerts and parties. It is really snug (not too snug though) so it doesn't ride up too high. With my high waisted jeans, it shows about an inch of skin. I have the shirt in red, and it looks just like the picture. Really, just a great shirt. So worth the money!",In love with this shirt.
