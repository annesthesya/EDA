terrible socks they stretch out badly and are bumpy and uncomfortable my son was very disapointed
Maybe these are XL on buzzaro world. Runs really small
"This was really uncomfortable and really small. The padding in it is really weird. When you have a larger chest and wear this bra, it looks like you have nipple pads instead of regular padding inside a bra. Really weird."
The hole in them are not sexy or comfy
"The product seems to be ok in size but the trim was really bad. It doesn't look ANYTHING like the picture. I don't have time to replace, so I had to keep. I will try to trim all the messy edges & steam the lapel so it looks like a cape."
"The material is too thin and the small size was too large for me. It didn't hug my curves and it was too long for my height. Not terrible material, but it wasn't flattering on me."
"Disappointed that they are not the color shown, still look and feel nice but the strings and back
are different than what's shown and that is very disappointing due to I was looking for the two tone color which is why I brought them, they arrived today as planned."
"There is apparently no such thing as a size 12 1/2 Ahnu Coburn low for men, even though Amazon lists it (""just two left in this size"" etc.).  Three times I ordered the 12 1/2 and three times I received size 13.  I was assured by Amazon on-line Customer service after the second time that in fact the size 12 1/2 existed and that I should order again in a couple weeks, which I did and once again got a 13!  I just checked the Ahnu site and they do not list a 12 1/2 so I am guessing it does not exits.  The shoes look good but are looser than I hoped, even with thick socks. I guess I have problem feet I guess (12 is too small) but if the size does not exist, Amazon should not continue to say that it does and then send (or Harrison shoes sends) the wrong size."
Very very disappointed.  Too small too cheap poor material
This runs small. Not made for tall people
"Beautiful ring, but scratches easily"
"Order size 7 because of heel height, normally wear size 6. Wore one day but hurt feet hurt very bad, could have ordered 7 1/2.  Shoe looks good but would not order again."
"It is a pretty scarf.  the threading was not trimmed up before package and sending.  There is a tag on it saying ""100% silk feeling polyester"" which I don't recall in the product description.  It wasn't too expensive so I will be keeping it rather take the hassle in sending it back"
For the price I'm not mad it broke three days from the time I got them.
"Lots of compression and no separation. Fit is definitely on the small side. After wearing it and washing it a couple of times, one of the velcro straps has become very itchy and bothersome."
"I was really excited for this swimsuit to arrive, the open sides where not as pictured. They came to close to the front could see sides of breast and was worse if sat or bent over. Straps around neck were very uncomfortable and hurt also the bottom of suit came up very high on bikini area. will be returning this swimsuit."
Watch was a lot bigger than I expected and I didn't like the band.
"I can't really tell how well these shoes would be because they were 2 sizes to big for me. Don't get  me wrong I actually love Reebok; they never let me down, this is a first."
Its a different fabric than other shirts that i bought.
I have a large bust and this supports nothing.
"I order a small, following the advices of ""get a size larger"". But I got a shirt that is a size M. For sure. No tag or anything in the shirt says Size Small. I got this shirt as a present. But now I won't give it because the size is ridiculous.
A waste of time and money. Not happy at all."
I ordered PWD005 orange. It was supposed to be a darker burnt orange but its more florescent hunting season orange. The zipper teeth are so sharp that they scratched my hands. the fit was as expected as i read other reviews that said to order larger. I am a med but ordered an extra large and it did fit fine. sending back and getting a refund. I'm not into deer hunting.
Didn't receive cross earrings! I received drop earrings instead.  If you read the details it says drop earrings!  The product is not as pictured
"Made out of the poorest quality leather on earth. I wear a clip on my belt which is very light weight, and this started to erode, around that area after about a month and a half! I recommend "" Adam Mens Genuine Italian Calfskin Leather Dress Belt 30mm Wide Polished Buckle"" instead, which under the same circumstances lasted one year plus."
"Would have had a five star review except for the terrible packaging.
Opened the envelope package and found out the hard way that it was leaking--got it all over my clothes and hands... There was still enough solution in the container to polish my rings, but overall not too happy with my experience."
The shoes are super cute but they do run a half a size too small.. I wanted to exchange the sizes but the company didn't offer that option.
"My size is usually Large or XL.  I went with XL based on the listing.  It barely fit and then only as a sort of low-rise.  The product is basically--and feels like--an athletic supporter.  There is no elastic around the legs so the material slides toward the center.  Fabric is a thin mesh and began to pull apart on first wearing.  Material, by the way, is 93% polyester-7%spandex."
Fit well but totally SEE THROUGH - returned
XL = ZERO support - works as a sleep bra if you wear one of those to protect your nipples...
"I got two pairs in the past year. At first I love the style and fit of them. However after several months, the color starts to peel off from the frames like pieces of plastic wraps."
"So, so pretty. But not comfortable. I even ordered a half size up from what I normally wear, and should have ordered full size up. But there's no arch support. If that's essential for you, look elsewhere. But damn, they are cute."
The pretty piece in the middle is gone.
"It's a cute enough outfit.  The sizing is way off.  Small on Amazon is 3-6 months.  When the costume arrived for my 4 month old the size on the package said ""Small: 12-18 months.  I'm also pretty sure that it would have to be a huge 12-18 month old.  more like a 2 or 3 year old."
"Honestly, not what I expected. From the quality of fabric to the size, I am disappointed."
"These are ugly, cheap and not at all like seller described!!! The price was cheap so my fault!!! I should have known!!  Would not buy from seller again; I'm sorry!"
"I have had my nose pierced for 14 years (ouch, that really just made me feel old) and have always preferred a nose bone or nose screw for the minimal look and ease of care. I work in a conservative office and though there is no policy against facial jewelry, I've always stayed on the conservative end. When I saw these with the bone on the end I was excited to try them out, even if just for the weekend for something a little fun. I've never gauged my nose so it has remained at the default 18g. So I ordered the 3/8"" size. Upon receiving I was very disappointed with the size of the bone (end). It is easily twice the size of my piercing hole. I attempted to lube up the hole and push it through but it was impossible. I also noticed while examining the piece that the actual hoop seemed to be very small. Curiously, I pushed it through backwards to confirm and it just barely cleared the edge of my nostril. I really don't think I have a large nose so I was surprised at how small it seemed. The actual jewelry seems very nice quality and would hold up well, I just wish there were a smaller gauge so I could truly try it out!

I wear a hard leather CK purse so I thought to buy these since it was heavy and would always lip down my shoulder. Thought the grips would help but the purse continued to fall no matter what I wear with my purse
"These were so big.....I think they were mismarked!  I have always worn a medium wether they are Russel, Champion, adidas, or under armour. Seemed to be two sizes to big. I gave them to a friend instead of returning."
Not sure what to think of these tanks. The quality in the fabric/cotton is great. The problem is the size. Too small for me. I ordered the XL. Very tight fit.
They should make smaller sizes. 5.5 and up
"ugh, one of those things that look better in the picture"
Shrank a lot! Would not buy again.
The fabric is horrible. I returned it.
Way big.. was suppose to get a 34x32 but it's more like a 38x32. Be cautious
"Good quality leather, good design concept but the card slots are to small for a standard credit card, ID card or drivers license. Gave it to my 12 year old grandson."
"Too loose, didn't stick to my head.  Would either slide down or fall off.  And I have a big head.  Also, not warm."
"These do NOT fit as traditional palazzo pants should..much more  form fitting, tapering wider at the ends. While the item fit, it ws NOT flattering for anyone with hips which is the reason one would buy palazzo pants in the first place. I did not send them back as I have a friend with narrow hips and gave them to her.."
"I ordered this for my son. The material is soft and seems to be good quality. They only problem is the zipper.

I ordered one and when it arrived it was broken. So I returned it for a replacement.

The second one came and it was fine for about a week. Then it broke just like the first one.  I'm not sending it back,  but for the price I expected better.  I could get a cheaper Hanes hoodie and get better quality."
"Bag itself is made of leather but the strap is polyurethane.  Also, bag had a large scratch on it as if someone cut it with a box-cutter."
The cups are a good fit but the support is not there.  The straps are binding and hurt.  I don't think I'll be able to wear it but I probably won't trouble sending it back either.  I'll pass it on to Goodwill or something.
"My son has had this bag for a year and a half about now. He's in Pre K, so there's not much going into the back pack, but there seems to be a problem with the bottom of the back pack.  It's wearing and almost seeing some holes??? UUmmm I put more stuff in my  back pack than he does and his back pack is getting holes?  Quality is a little bit of a problem here.  My kid love power rangers though."
"For the price, I figured it would be worth a try, which it was, but I prefer better made/designed underwear."
Cheaply made. I returned them
"The picture is definitely deceiving in my book. I ordered this cap thinking that it would be a bit more form fitting to my head but that wasn't the case. The top of the cap stretches much longer than I would have imagined and makes it look like you're wearing an elf hat.

I returned this product after receiving it and trying it on."
"More like a cape, I ordered a small"
"I should have listened to the other reviews. I also had a strap that was shorter than the other. It wouldn't even reach all the way around my ankle and I by no means have large ankles.  This is very disappointing, they are adorable. I would not recommend this sandal. And I returned them and had to pay all my own shipping and handling."
didn't suite my needs for an off-the-shoulder top. cute is way to slim and fabric is too flimsy.
"These were painful right out of the box. I exchanged for a larger size thinking perhaps they'd be more comfortable, to no avail. My toes were smashed together and the top flap cut into the front of my ankle. These are cute af, but not for my piddies."
"DOES NOT FIT WELL, CUT IS NOT RIGHT"
these are so small I don't even know how you could use them for anything
cheap and too small and narrow
"Unfortunately, this is the second one of these suitcases that has lost a wheel in transit. They are way too expensive to have such a design flaw."
Too tight and I ordered a size up.
"After one day of using, we notice there is a hole on the top front that hardly notice which was pretty sure from manufacture. Also the handle has only one level which is shorter than what it descripted so we I 5 feet try to help my daughter roll the backpack, it is too short. Everything else is good so far."
These are bit snug at the calf....especially for chunkier babies ;)
False advertising.... Not the same shoes in the picture
Not writing about this anymore
this  to hevy he is not use.
"These shoes fit great, however when they arrived they were dis colored. The black had faded ugly brown patches on one shoe. The other shoe was fine."
"Too small. I ordered three sizes 32, 33, and 34 all were the same. Upon looking further into the issue they were all actually a size 28."
"While the service at Amazon excels these were ordered has extra wide but came more narrow than any of my shoes of standard width. Would have liked to have keep them, easy to get on and off and looked like they would last, but they just don't fit in width, sending them back.  So if you have wide feet, beware."
toddler can only wear for a short time very heavy
Bracelet broke the first day! And the color came a pale pastel pink instead of the happy vibrant pink pictured.
Color doesn't look like the picture. Color is dark and dull looking.
Not great quality even for the price
"Ecco's are supposed to be super comfortable.  I have a job where I end up walking job sites all day and thought this shoe with it's sneaker bottom and leather professional top would be a good solution.  It ended up being on the narrow side, rubbed, and Just overall not comfortable, with very little cushion in the sole.  Very surprising for what is supposed to be a super comfortable shoe.  I loved the look of the shoe, but the fit was off, and I returned."
"This pair did not fit like my last pair of the same style.  Disappointed, because I loved my last pair."
Watch does not keep correct time
"Some products look better on the hanger than on the body but it really depends on your body. Personally, it just didn't look good on me despite the fact I really like the design and colour. I think I'd get this custom made to fit better."
"I'm a girl who LOVES shoes. I have really pricey ones and shoes that I bought for 10 bucks, meaning that I know a pretty and comfortable shoe, regardless of price. These shoes are pretty but atrocious to walk in, like need to see a doctor after one wear painful. I'm sure a gal could manage an hour or two in these but they lack any semblance of support and I guarantee major pain after a few hours of wear. I walked around my kitchen 2 times and immediately put them back in the box!! Ladies...you have been warned!!!!"
These shoes fell apart in less than 7 wears. SO disappointed in New Balance. Absolute garbage I only wish I had the time to write sooner (I was in and out of the hospital since July of 2015) and get a refund.
"I do not like these at all, to big, this is what I learned, size 18 and 18W are different, 18 is smaller than 18W, by a whole size. anyway I found these on line at costco, for 14.99 so if you are a member I would look there they are better and a lot of colors"
Very disappointed. I need a 20x magnifier to read the words. Not worth the price
its very cute! how ever mine came with a hole in the top right shoulder seam. so will not purchase again.
do not waste your money cheaply made does not look anything like the photo!
"The stones are extremely pale, almost clear. You can't really tell they're green. I didn't return because it was too much trouble."
Ran the day that I put them.. Usually spanx last for at least a couple of months with me. I believe they where a little dry rotted.
This bra has removable pads. Maybe some people want that but they really didn't work for me. All you could see was the huge shape of the pad over my boob. I took them out and then you could see the imprints of the straps that connect the bra to the shoulder straps. It just was not flattering and I cant see being able to wear this under shirts without it being lumpy and noticeable. Spring for the medela one which is just a couple bucks more and looks way better on.
I couldn't even try these on because they smelled like fish when I opened the package. I returned them immediately.
"Buyer beware. The headband and the fluff on it are not matching colors. For instance, the pink headband has a darker pink flower and light pink band... the cream colored one, the headband part is more white and the flower part is dark cream. Poorly made, that they did not use the same color material for both. It felt like a toddler actually assembled them. The headbands are also very very thin, something I could have made by cutting out a strip of material... there is no hem and it is single ply. :-( Don't waste your money!"
wayyy too clunky.  I thought these were going to be more like infinity hoops but they are way bigger than the part that actually goes in the earring hole.  I bought these to use as nose rings but they make you look like a bull.
"Saftey Clasp comes undone, had to return it."
"They run large, and although all Crocs tend to be wide, these however fell off my feet and I returned them."
"EARRINGS NOT AS PICTURED , BAIT AND, SWITCH"
After singing adidas' praises from one pair of shoes and two pairs of pants it came to a screeching halt with these boots. The right shoe was too tight but I thought it would quickly stretch out. It didn't. Also there is no cushioning or arch support. I'm using a energel insert for cushion and super feet for support. I would have returned these had I not been so sure they would stretch.
These boots are not particularly warm nor are they good on slippery snow.  They are too open and loose at the top so snow enters.  The most disconcerting thing though is how you can feel every pebble on the ground while wearing them which means that they are too thin to actually keep you warm. I wear them as house slippers
Too see through. Weird fit.
"The shirt fit as expected, but it was a little more transparent than I would've hoped for from a white shirt. After one washing, it didn't look so great. Lots of fuzzies."
Great slipper but runs wayyyyyy to large. So they're useless
Had to return. Pretty watch but came in with a dead battery
"Walking in these shoes for a day trip to the fair got me a burn under my feet.  Although the shoes are cute, the material of the insides of the shoe (the part that touches the bottom of your feet) is not made for movement. It's similar to rug burn. I had to call my trip to the fair short because my feet were burning at the bottom. I went home and switched shoes, but he damage was already done. I couldn't walk without feeling the pain.

Side note, don't trust the positive feedback by others. When I told the sellers about the issue, they said they'd fix it for a positive review. I refuse to give false feedback and have someone else experience what I did, for a refund."
"Bought it for myself. Sizes up 2 sizes. I'm 5'9"". Ended up giving it to my 1st grader. It's tiny. I don't think you could buy a size too big. Go big or don't buy it."
"the boots came scratched up on the toe, had to return.  They were cute looking, but the quality was questionable."
Way to tight and small
"I ordered the pink dress in an XL/XXL  and  I am somewhat pear shaped, however, it was really really too large up top. Simply too wide underneath the arm and across my shoulders, back and bosom.  The bottom fit okay.  Too bad, I couldn't wear it because the dress is a vibrant pretty color and the material didn't feel super cheap and thin. I may get it in a size lower (L)."
I got a different product
"I bought this dress but will be returning it.  The material is not great quality, and while the top of the dress fit nicely, the skirt was sewn in such a way that it didn't fall straight, but instead flared up at the bottom in odd-looking way.  In general, not great construction.

I bought a size small, and it fit me fairly well.  I'm 5'4"", 125 lbs, and typically a size 2.  A size 4 likely would have fit in this dress too, although the dress is definitely not floor length or even ankle length.  It ended mid-calf on me, which wasn't the length I was looking for."
"Did not work for me at all, returned.  Way too big, side of shoe cut into ankle bone, not flexible at all, very uncomfortable.  Got the Merrell Moab's instead and they were comfortable right out of the box and fit my feet perfectly.  Please note I am just a casual hiker though."
"These look fine, but they are stretch material, and small at that.  Would not buy again."
"The only good thing about the is that they stick on securely all day if you need it to.  However, i strongly recommend against buying these. They are small compared to other comparable products. It barely coveted what i needed it to, and my areolas aren't that big! Also, it leaves terrible red marks, partly due to the size and partly due to the adhesive. I wore a pair everyday for three days and stopped once i noticed how red my skin was getting. It's been a week and a half since i wore these, and the skin around my nipples are still red!! Definitely would not recommend."
"I love Dansko, and have several pairs of clogs. This time, I wanted to buy a vegan shoe; I'd been thinking about the ethics of leather for awhile. Anyway, while the toe box is perfect, and the sole is every bit as comfortable as every other Dansko I've ever owned, this pair rubs one heel. But it rubs enough to give me a blister, without socks, in a very short time. I don't think they'll breathe, either, because they are coated with a rubber substance. I will continue wearing them, but just not without socks.

UPDATE: After three or four times wearing these shoes, I'm returning them. The vinyl/robber coating is starting to crack where my toes bend. The crack is the separation of the coating from the fabric underneath."
We bought this backpack about 3 months ago because it was big and was on rollers. The zipper is already broken. It was not made with the quality of zipper that you would expect for the size of bag. I would have expected a higher quality zipper. It's already broken and unusable. I am very disappointed.
Didn't hold up for very long. I will be looking for an alternative soon.
i found wallet too small for use for my needs. it could not hold all items from my original billflod
Bag broke before I even had a chance to use it! The embalm came off the day it arrived. Wouldn't  advice anyone to buy it.
"This is not what I thought it would be. I was looking for a poncho for my Mom and this is more like a blanket cut to just lay over your shoulders. Definitely not worth the price for what we got. Looks cute in the picture but does not look like that when it is on. Also, I am 5ft 9in and this is long on me so, on my Mom who is 5ft 6in, it is too long. She doesnt really like it and I am disappointed because I was excited to give it to her. I have a poncho that I love and I thought this would be like it."
"The fit was smaller than expected. I gave it 2 stars, however, the dress itself was absolutely beautiful."
The belt buckle fell off after 1-2 weeks of use. Cannot reattach
I returned it because it was way too small. They are going to refund me. I was hoping to get a size larger because I love the style. It too bad that I will not be able to have it.
So tiny...need a picture of a dime with every earring to see sizes.  I kept them but not happy...
Very poor quality. Not worth it. Immediately broke
It should have been big based on their sizing chart---it was not
"I was hoping these would be just like an earlier pair of NYDJ jeans I bought. They are not--fit isn't great, legs are very wide, almost like a boot cut but loose around the knees too. Fabric is thin, flimsy, and not a real twill like denim should be. I'm sending these back."
"These are huge. At least half an in too big. I'm a size 9 but as you can see, there's plenty of space. Lost my money."
I'm 5'8 and the armour pieces are to big the mask is lame smells bad and has a huge crease in it
"It is really nice looking and sturdy, but it is really heavy all by itself.  Add a few magazines and an ipad to it and it's too heavy to carry over your shoulder."
no logo on the back
This is a very cheap watch - the strap broke almost immediately.
"I have ordered size 6 ASICS for years.  When these shoes came, they were much too long.  They seem to have changed their sizing.
Also, they were also tight across the toes with an inflexible band.
I was surprised at these shoes, as I have worn and loved similar shoes for years."
I was very disappointed with this outfit. It had many hanging threads. This is not what I would expect of Calvin Klein. It was very poor quality.
Too large so I sent these back. The lining was slippery as well. I didn't reorder this type of sandal.
Very small. Would maybe fit a preteen. Has a square shape. Makes it look like I have a square head.
"Length Description was 7.4"" & thats not accurate!  More like almost a foot!"
"way too tight around the strap area, had to return them"
"This is an odd shoe arch-on an inside flyer .it says it ""takes"" some time to get used to walking in them. I could not even make it 1/2 hour on carpet in house before my feet started cramping. To make them fit, my toes hung over the edge. Shoe was pretty but not worth keeping, went back to CLARK"
"I didn't like it it is very filmsy and thin not a real blazer I was really dissapointed this looks more like a shirt no lining, not what I expected."
Not exactly what I expected from pictures. I thought there would be slots for cards and license.
"It's cute, but not practical. It doesn't fold up so it's awkward in my purse and things get caught on it constantly."
cups definitely are not as easy as very tight not a 38 straps cut in shoulders just don't even know why I bother making things like this it was pretty if it was it would be better
Bottoms were too small the top too big.
"Very poor quality and one was coming apart at the seam. They are flimsy and loose fitting and too high priced for what they are, a dust rag."
Beautiful when I opened them I waited to wear it then wore it on a 2 day weekend trip and silver plating was wearing off just not worth the money I should tried wearing them sooner and I would've returned them right away
"I should have listened to the 1 star reviews. The tanks are not soft, smaller in size, and terrible craftsmanship. These were inexpensive and now I know why. Hard to believe Hanes  sales this trash."
"Ordered a size 4 as this is what my son wears in all other shoes, and these were about an inch too big.  We returned them as I'm afraid that once they will fit it won't be the right season."
"A nice sized bag with a pleasant, functional design. If only it wouldn't fall apart!

I have used this bag 4 to 5 times carrying very light items...such as extra pair of socks, and a t-shirt. Nothing heavy, not abuse, nothing stressful. Like other reviews have stated, this bag will fall apart at the seams.

It's too late for me to return it. I'm out $12. I wish I had spent $20 or  $25 on a better quality product."
It's perfect for us! It did start falling apart before the end of the year.
broke after a little
Good quality but I guess the two stars are for my self for no research about 100% cotton socks and the way they fit and become after a long day of walking and working
Love the bag and the space but the clip is not locking and I can't make the bag short enough. Already on my trip so I can't return yet. Check clip when u get the bag!
"Sweater looks great, the design is different which I enjoy but after putting on the sweater, the light weight of the material make it feel cheap and not as attractive as the advertise photo that is presented throught Amazon.  I do like wearing clothing that is different and stands out when I'm in the church, work, or just the public arena.  Maybe there will be a fashion product or design I will find from H2H that will keep other guessing where I purchase my clothing...  Lets see what's next for H2H, as I venture forward to see what going to catch my attention."
These shorts were a little short in the waist. I bought an XL because of previous reviews and they were still too short from waist to inseam. In addition to being small the shorts are made out of very flimsy material.  The front seam and the hem of one leg have already started to separate.  I've worn them twice and that's all I'm likely to get out of them. Just goes to prove you can't skimp on price for quality retro clothes. I wouldn't buy anything else from this brand.
"I really like these boots, however, after wearing just a few times they have begun making a ""squishing"" noise while walking in them.  I can only assume a hole has developed in the sole.  It would be nice to have  a different form of communication than just the returns option on the orders section."
"the earrings are extremely big and the stones are a darkish gray, no blue labradorite tone on them"
"Definitely not skinny, more baggy than the picture. Rough and hard fabric is so low quality the red color dropped to dye a towel washed with it completely pink. The fly is a pain in the crotch to zip as if rusted."
"Cheaply made, the ring is so light and not as nice as the pictures. Giving it 2 stars because i will probably wear it until I find a new one."
But awesome color
"This is NOT sterling silver as I wore it for only 1 hour and it turned my finger green. I will not be purchasing jewelry from this company again. Very disappointed as I really wanted an authentic spoon ring. While it is marked, ""925""...it is not authentic. :/  Total waste of money."
"These are beautiful boots, but they are not very comfortable.  There's chance you could break them in, but it would be cruel to your feet.  It was disappointing."
"Ordered a size 8 for my daughter, got a 9.  I wear an 8-1/2 and these boots were big, really big, on me.  Normally I would think it was a simple mistake, but judging from other reviewers who received a size they didn't order, it's not a one-off.  As far as comfort and style goes, the style was like the pic but because of the size issue, I have no idea how comfortable they are."
"I have been wearing Danskos for a decade now. I have bought many pairs for myself and friends and family as gifts. I love the original clog that is made in Denmark. The clog will last forever and is so comfortable and truly lives up to Danskos reputation of craftmanship and is even theraputic to people with back and feet problems. A few years ago I bought their contemporary styles and saw that they were made in Portugal and fit differently (noy as well) but I was ok with it. Well, for my birthday this year I got the Dansko Scout Brush off ankle boot. When I opened the box I noticed right away that it looked different. The boots were shaped more like the box than the Danskos I was used to. Then I put them on and it did not seem like they were actually crafted to fit the human foot. The craftmanship and quality have been sacrificed when Dansko started making their shoes in China. This will be the last pair of Danskos I buy that is made anywhere but Denmark. I paid $112 for these boots and they are like a cheap pair of boots I could have gotten at Wal-Mart for $20."
"This was one of my daughters birthday presents and she was very happy. She wore it each day but always taking it off for showers, pool and at night to sleep. Within a week and a half the silver coating was wearing off and leaving black marks on everything. Very disappointed . I knew it wouldn't be an expensive piece of jewelry or last forever however I did think it would last at least a few months."
The inside front straps are different lengths on the pair I received.  I will be returning them.  Disappointing quality.
It does not close once you put all the earrings.
Too small. These things came at just under size 12. They are snug and I'm afraid that after I wash them they'll be so small I'll have to just give them away (probably to my daughter).
Not very soft material. The grey is actually like an off white kind of beige color.
"A little disapointed in the shoe.  I have bought Dyeables before and they were great!! The size was way too big for an 8.5 I put them on for 2 minutes and I had glitter all over the place.  I'm sure if I had kept them, the glitter would have been gone by the time I actually needed to wear them.  Better luck next time Dyebles.."
Not with the money and cheaply made
"As many other posters have said, these socks are incredibly tight, and even though I have got the size that is supposed to fit up to size 15 shoe, while I am a 14, they are almost impossible to get on."
Eh!!!
Don't lass
No way I could walk in these because the were snug around the ankle and my foot just kind of hung from there. Super cute though so I was disappointed.
"The watch is pretty but it is thicker than it looked in the pictures and fairly heavy for its size.  I had to pay a jeweler to remove links from the band to make it fit.  The watch died only a few weeks after purchasing it, and a jeweler assured me that it was not due to a dead battery.  Fortunately, Amazon.com is great about returns and refunded me my money."
Tiny and non flexible.  To get even a slight bend you have to force it and risk breaking.  It tightly fits my pinky finger which was not the  intended finger though it is my fault for assuming it would be larger like similar items.
"So tiny
I ordered the 30 in for my daughter
Definitely returning
Disappointed!!
Please see photo"
"this cover up is oddly designed. the straps are connected to the side of the breast area . I'll make it work, but its a odd."
Most of these broke after a few uses.
"I have had many Baggalini bags before, and loved them. So I was expecting to like this one too. It has lots of pockets, and it seemed like a great layout. The problem is, the purse is too narrow to fit much in those pockets.  My phone only fits if I maneuver things around. If my phone is in, my keys won't fit. There is just not enough room.  Also, the strap is so slippery, it falls off my shoulder every chance it gets.  This is not my ideal purse, and after only a week, I've already ordered a different one."
"I bought this skirt listed as LL Womens Tie Dye Fold Over Maxi Skirt here&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LL-WB670-Womens-Fold-Over-Maxi-Skirt-XXXL-WHITE/dp/B01E6PPKL8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LL WB670 Womens Fold-Over Maxi Skirt XXXL WHITE</a>.  Because of the price I didn't expect it to be super high quality but I expected much more than what I received.  The main concern I have is it runs very small and is super duper thin and clingy even though I went up a size than normal.  It is very long so if you're short you'll definitely have to use fold over but I also noticed on this skirt that it is longer on the left than the right.  This skirt works great for lounging around the house or outside play but I wouldn't expect to get much use out of it.  I can get much better quality at Wal-Mart or Rainbow. I purchased two skirts from different manufacturers but come to find out they're by the same company--MADE BY JOHNNY GROUP INC.  The other skirt I purchased is MBJ Womens Lightweight Floor Length Maxi Skirt here&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MBJ-WB296-Womens-Lightweight-Floor-Length-Maxi-Skirt-XXXL-WHITE/dp/B00KJ144R0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MBJ WB296 Womens Lightweight Floor Length Maxi Skirt XXXL WHITE</a>.  Even though they're by the same company the first one has a better quality than the second one mentioned."
I am not a big fan of any onesie where the neckline does not stretch easily and has no buttons to open it up in order to pull it over your baby's head. It is always a struggle getting these things over their head unless the entire onesie is a frontal zip up or button up. From now on I will only buy onesies that open from the front or have buttons to expand the neckline.
"I was very disappointed with these earrings.  I love moonstones and own many, but these were not as described or shown.  They clearly state that they are rainbow moonstones that capture the entire color spectrum with every movement.  This statement is simply not true.  The earrings I received are completely white.  In addition, one of the stones is cracked.  I will be sending these back.  They are not worth $30."
Shrunk badly after One wash.  Do not recommend.
I wear a 36D and to cups on this one are weird and too large.
The sizing was inaccurate but the quality was good.
Not the same at all as in picture
"I love Sanuk sandals but these ones don't fit at all, they have a horribly wide solid band running through each strap so they are not stretchy at all, I ordered the same size I always do and I can't get them on my foot!  Very very disappointed."
I returned the shoes because I didn't like how the heel looked. It looked quite chunky especially from the back.
This is my second order of the same neckless. It wasn't as good in quality and it started peeling off the silver coating after about 3 weeks.
"I used this for the first time on my trip overseas and by the time I retrieved my bag at my initial destination, the luggage strap was no where to be found.  I made sure it was secured as tight as possible around my luggage before I checked it at the airport but it still apparently fell off.  I will not waste my money on another."
"Does OK but didn't clean copper very well , not overly impressed with the product ."
This bracelet broke after the first time wearing it. I am very disappointed.
this is a stupid idea....hate it
Doesnt worth it. I wasted my money.
"I need a good light weight, highly supportive sports bra. This seemed perfect, however, this bra is way too tight to wear while cycling. It feels as if my lungs can't expand enough to take in the air needed while pushing. Might work better with a third row of fasteners. There is enough room on the fastener area and most bras offer 3 rows... The cup area also fit a bit oddly. The overlaying was not forgiving enough?"
"Very cheap looking, and thin material."
"huge waste of money! I ordered 2 pair, the natural and a black pair. The black size 8 fit accurately, the natural are more like a 9 to 10! ridiculously large. I wore them for a bit otherwise I would have sent them back"
I was eager to recieve it but after 2 calls to Amazon Customer Service it never arrived. Full refund of course!
"Good shoe for money.
13 March 2016 Revision:  Good first impression; now they are coming apart inside the sole ever so slightly that they make a groaning sound that sounds like the floor beneath you is weakening (somewhat like a balsa flooring was slightly giving way beneath your feet), but because the sound follows you wherever you go you know it is the shoe.  So these are good if you want the novelty of a groaning shoe.  Perhaps I can get into the world record book for longest walk with a groaning shoe."
"Based on other reviews, I went up half a size. That was too large, so my recommendation would be to purchase your true size. More problematic for me was the way they looked on my feet. They appear quite wide and the very rounded toe box made my feet look huge, almost clown-like."
Don't buy this. It's cheap fabric and isn't represented well in the advertisement photo. The painted fabric feels gross and scratchy and the back is an awkwardly pinned chiffon / polyester material.
"The size on this was WAY OFF!!!! So, I don't want to get into my specifics.... But, I ordered this two sizes larger than most clothes I have in my closet and it was still small. The return of this went very smooth; THANK YOU AMAZON."
Fell a part Nader this first time at cleaners
"arch of boot is too tight,...hard to get on or off"
I am a size Large and couldn't even get these on even though they are super stretchy.  I would return them but it's probably not cost effective.  They were slightly too big for my 11 year old daughter who is a size 00 or Small.
So so SO small. I followed other reviewers recommendations but the sleeves were super short and it almost fit me like a crop top.... It is now at Goodwill for someone who is much shorter than me. I'm 5'7.
Had to return as they were kinked before I received them
"kinda small, not long like I was hoping for... SUPER SHEER AND THIN!"
The  outside zippered pockets were too small for my phone.  I have another Baggallini purse that looks like this one but in another color and it is perfect for my needs.  However I needed a black one.
Nothing was the same size
This is a waste of money unless purchasing for a child
this garment shows up as solid black (which is what I wanted!) when you click the link.
"These shoes look like a comfy slip on sneaker, but once I tried them on, they were hard with no cushioning. They also had stitching inside the shoe that was exposed, and uncomfortable."
Too small and the material was not soft.
0-3 months and new born is very diff. I got the wrong size..
"I thought my search for a dress to take anniversary pictures in the park in ended when I saw this dress.  The reviews were good but when I got the dress it was WAY to big for me.  I got a small and I am 5'3 155 pounds.  It just had no shape on me and just drooped everywhere on me and I am not a very small person at all. I wear a medium in other size clothes. The concept and idea is very cute and the model pulls it off but for me, it's a no no.  an XS would have probably worked but they didn't have it.  I hope this fits pretty on someone else."
"I have ordered many other shirts from this seller and loved them all so had no reservations ordering this shirt in a 3x like my others. This shirt is way too small and short, it is no where near a 3x, maybe a 1x at best if that. Definitely will not be wearing this shirt and not sure if it's worth the hassle to return."
"Ugh, do not waste your time. As soon as I gave this set to my daughter...they turned brown."
It is small size
For it to be a  XXL the underwire cups are definitely made for a B or C cup size. So if you are a busty woman  go up two or three sizes to accommodate.
different picture than what i got. i would have worn them but they were too small. i gave them away
"This is SO cheap. I don't mind getting something of this quality but it is in no WAY worth the price. This is dollar store quality...which is fine, if you're paying a dollar for it ! So, buy with caution.
It is hard plastic with a very cheap stocking type cover over it. The hair is hot glued on with glue everywhere.
I will try and upload pictures..."
"Wore the shoes one evening for about 4 hours. When I got home and took them off I noticed the sides of the wedge was peeling off. What appeared to be some type of leather was actually paper and it was peeling off. Also, the toe area of the shoe is very narrow and even if length fits, your toes will hang off. Very displeased with this item and am sending back for refund due to poor quality. Would not recommend. Please see attached photo."
"I have fine hair and had hoped that if I used just a real, tiny amount it would be okay, but not so at all.  No amount of this is small enough for fine hair, period.  I gave my bottle to a girl at the office who has a full head of thick medium length hair, and she really likes it, said even her husband likes it on his super long beard.  So it's a good product, obviously, just have to have the hair for it, which I do not.  Thanks!"
This is another type of bra. Not the Ahh Bra like it says in the listing. No support and no coverage. Useless.
"Bought two Playtex bras from this seller as replacement for a discontinued Playtex bra that I wore for years and years ( Playtex # 4138).

This bra (Playtex # 4913) I will be returning for an exchange to a different style because the quality of it is VERY poor, with lots of cheap plastic parts (strap loops and band hooks). It's unevenly sewn together and the seams are off, so there's no way it'll last for repeated washings and wear. But that's NOT a seller problem, that's a Playtex problem! It also fit weird, kind of baggy along the bottom of the cups next to the underwire, like I was wearing a sock instead of a bra. But that's likely a function of the cup style, which is two thin layers of fabric rather than thick molded cups, which I'm used to. As a size DD cup, fit and lift is critical to a comfortable and attractive fit. This won't work for me at all. Too bad because the color and style are very pretty on the hanger.

This seller was fairly quick in getting the items to me, and very helpful/responsive when there were weather related shipping delays. Would buy from them again. Meanwhile, I'll be exchanging this for a different style in the hopes that I can find a permanent replacement for my favorite but now discontinued Playtex bra (# 4138)."
TERRIBLE BELT. HATE IT
"The quality of the material is definitely worse than the original crocs ofcourse, and the soles seem to wear out pretty quickly which is also understandable at this price point.

But what made me toss them out was because my child somehow ALWAYS trip over and fall in them. She loves them and always wants to wear them over other shoes, but every time she wears them somehow she always ends up crying with bleeding knees. She has always been wearing the original crocs and never had these issues with them - this time I went cheap and decided to try these out, but seeing how at one point she was bleeding from both her knees since she fell twice in a short walk (and she never has this problem with any other shoes) it finally occurred to me that it's because of the shoes, I decided to toss them out and go back to the original crocs (which actually was only about $5 more than this one on Amazon). They are light weight and look comfortable, but somehow didn't work out for my child's feet."
The bag was a nice soft leather and beautiful color but way to small for my needs.  I returned it.
"I had bought another pair of flats from this brand, (http://www.amazon.com/Wanted-Shoes-Womens-Glitter-Ballerina/dp/B0051EPCU8/ref=pd_sbs_shoe_1) and I loved them, so I thought I'd get another pair from the same brand, and picked this one.  But I'm really disappointed in it.  First of all, the material smells so strong, I can smell it in the kitchen even now (it's been like a month plus) from the shoe rack.  Also stinks up the car if I wear it.  Also, one of the stones fell out the second time I wore them.  I had to super glue it back on there, and the stone doesn't even really fit in the groove, I just had to shove it back in there somehow.  I'm thinking it won't hold well.

Oh well."
"These are really cute and really comfortable the sizing is way off I wear a 7 1/2-8 ordered a 9 they were so tiny I measured them next to my size 8 clark sandals, they were a good 1 1/2"" smaller, I have other onex  shoes and a 9 always fit, could they of mixed up a 6 for a 9?"
"When a women has an 11 narrow/extra narrow, shoe size, the 11 medium or in this case women 11 Medium/Men 10.  Way too big.

Can't use a lot of socks to take up the space...Hawaii is too warm."
its to short
Heel is too shallow.
Great looking dress but you definitely should buy a size up...it is very snug and you may be showing more than you want to show if you do anything other than stand perfectly still.  Purple is more of a mulberry color than true purple
"Nothing out of the ordinary with this bag. In fact it is below quality compared to other lower priced backpacks.
If it wasn't for my kid's wish, I would've never spent the money on it."
"This is a very cheap product. I've worn it twice, and its already tattered. Although the material is nice, the stitching unraveled easily. Also, it sits on your body awkwardly. I wouldn't reccomend this cheap cardigan to anyone. The first time I tried on this cardigan, it had holes in one of the pocket."
A bit disappointed at how narrow this boot is. There is no stretch and I can not wear it comfortably due to chafing. The boot is cute and well made but not for wide width feet.
I had this belt for about a year. It is made nice and the leather is thick. Recently the bar that holds the pin on the buckle broke off. The metal that is used is obviously not strong enough. Now the belt is useless.
"This was not what I expected at all.

It's a great option...if you're looking for a tank that's see-through and too large.

This brand usually has quality products. Unfortunately this is not one of them. It's cheaply made and seams start unraveling after 2 washes.

Very disappointed."
flemzee wish i could return it
"Not big enough when fully opened to put paper bills in. I thought by the dimensions and the pictures, once opened,  I could put my paper money in and not have to fold it over so I had to send this back.  I wanted this for a small cross body bag but it didn't work out for me. I don't need all the plastic slots for cards, I just need a few slots and a place to properly fit paper money."
"Not as pictured...the picture of this dress is adorable, the blob of mummy fabric I received was far from what you see.  It was almost like it was double layered polyester.  It clung in strange places and did not hang well.  The color is also not this rich.  It was more of a strawberry red than cranberry.  I was very disappointed because this picture looks like the perfect dress!"
Fit strangely and made my chest look like I was really saggy.
"When they said thin, they meant it. Turned out significantly thinner than I would've liked."
"Stitching on this shoe fell apart within a month. Where the laces go through the holes, all of the stitching fell apart making these shoes completely worthless. Great fitting and good looking shoe, but as others have said, they fell apart."
"I had high hopes for this, but it's not meant for girls with larger hips."
"Very comfortable, perfect for work. Interesting heel. The tip of one of the heels kept falling off and they are a peculiar shape. Luckily I found it and super glued it on. Otherwise, great shoes for work

I'm updating this review because one of the tacs from the heel was loose after a couple of days wear. I tried to super glue it back on but it fell off again. I can't find a replacement because of the odd shape and I can't stand the clicking noise so the shoes are useless after wearing a few times."
Product is nice but tree cannot be attached to base with the bolt provided.
Fit it ok but vision is compromised.  Have to take them off to see in half shade half sun.  Disappointed.
"This dress fits fine, but the pattern you are showing it's not what was delivered. Totally different color all together."
"There's something about the cut of the toe box on this shoe that just kind of ruins it for me.  It looks very ""old lady"" on your foot (sorry old ladies out there!) and I'm sending it back."
"These boots lasted for about 6 months and then they completely fell apart. I loved how comfortable they were, but from the get-go, the heel was squishy (seemed hollow) and when the boots started to fall apart (about 4 months in), I noticed that the heels basically were hollow. I am really sad that I can't wear these boots anymore, even if they were poorly made as I loved the way that they looked and how light weight they were. For $30, these should have lasted longer than 6 months - I have some boots and shoes that were half the price and lasted 3x as long."
Orange is not orange.
Fabric is very cheap. Full of wrinkles right out of the dryer and the hems curl. I would not recommend.
"I'm not sure what's going on with the cut of these underwear, but the actual crotch part seems uncomfortably narrow while the leg holes seem too large/loose. Loose leg holes mean that they don't stay in place...talk about wedgies! It was like the bikinis I got really wanted to be thongs, and would try their hardest to migrate the leg opening all the way over into full wedgie position. The worst part was that this 6 pack was mixed in with my existing underwear, so I'd forget about their wayward ways as I went to grab a clean pair of underwear. An hour into my work day, and I'd feel that tell tale creeping feeling of the leg hole elastic heading west. I ended up throwing each pair in the trash at the end of the day as I rediscovered the problem each time.
Maybe going down a size would have snugged everything up so they stayed better gripped into position? That doesn't seem comfy. I won't be buying this again."
"I bought this bra after reading all the great reviews. I borrowed the Medela brand from a friend and liked it, but decided to buy Simple Wishes because it was a little cheaper. Big mistake! Why I don't like this:

1. Bulky fabric - the fabric is thicker than the Medela brand but it's not noticeably comfortable

2. Zipper goes in the wrong direction - the Medela brand you zip from bottom to top like a bustier. This is reverse, top to bottom. It's difficult to put the zipper together at the top and squeeze the bra sufficiently around your torso.

3. Horns are difficult to put in - I use a Medela Symphony pump and they are difficult to get into the bra holes without flinging milk. My complaint about the Medela brand is that the holes are too loose.

4. Too many parts that I'll never use - I'm 5'3"", 118 pounds, 29 B bra size pre-maternity sizes. The extra zipper flap is useless to me, and I'll never use the bra/halter straps. Because there is so much extra fabric in the back (I overlap the full velcro flap portion), there is a lot of extra fabric behind me, and a bump when I wear it.

I would return this bra if I could. Since I can't, I'll use it begrudgingly."
"These are very pretty, but got scratched terribly the first time I travelled with them.
My second trip the wheel fell off.
Pretty but not practical"
It looked like a big pajama top when I tried it on.
This is so pretty and I was hoping it was going to be comfortable but I tried it on and it just wasn't.  So sadly I have to return it.
"I bought this watch for my son for his Birthday in August,he was away at college at the time. When he came home for the Holidays the band was broken,I have tried to find a replacement band without sucess. I tried communicating with Amazon but have not been able to. I am very dissapointed. I tried to fine  out th e warranty but have not been able to. He did not even get three months wear from it
M.G"
Somewhat large. To long..Fabric not classical  Levys
"The shoes arrived sooner than expected;after one week, walking for a period in time in these shoes, I realize my instep does hurt and it feels hard in the sole of the shoe as a result. I won't buy this shoe again nor recommend to anyone. It is very uncomfortable when walking and it feels hard against the sole of the feet"
"I like that these are thin fabric ONLY for fitting underneath jeans if these weren't so baggy and loose.

I expected these to look like the picture, but you can see light through the ones I received  :(  They remind me of cheap knock-off jockey shorts.

These are too loose and baggy to be comfortable, and being loose and baggy, I couldn't wear them underneath anything  :(

I am 5' 6"" and a hefty 224 lbs - most definitely a couch potato.  Size 1x is much too loose (I usually wear a 2x for bottoms).  I've already washed them so I can't return them, so I'll put a note on them and donate to Salvation Army where I know they'll get an appreciative person.

I may or may not try a smaller pair, I might stick with leggings under jeans."
Did not like the way the wallet looked or the material. I sent it back asking for a refund.
These were very thin.  They were very wide at the top as well.
Poor material
"pretty but uncomfortable, couldn't wear them"
One of the handles just broke of the bag
"Cute but sheer fits fine not too tight, fits to size."
"Sleeves are way too small.  The bodice fits well, but the sleeves are uncomfortably tight."
"I am disappointed in the readability of this black watch. The crystal is curved instead of flat and the black face is concave. This seems to sometimes result in shadows and reflections that can make the hands difficult to see at times. I had hoped that the gold on black would be easier to read. I just noticed one of the customer review pictures shows this too. I afded two of my own. I intend to return, perhaps getting the white face which might not have the same issue. I purchased a lower priced Biden watch for $11 (regularly $15) which seems to be a better value having a sapphire crystal and luminescent hands as well as a nicer box if gifting. I don't know of these low priced watches will hold up but I have a $15 Casio that has been put through two years of abuse and is still going strong."
WAY too small & of poor quality
"Had to return.  Material was thin but adequate. Color was great; however, pictures makes it look like there would be an abundance of fabric such that you could bunch it at the waist to wear/style it like the pic. No such luck."
very cheap looking shoe.....going back :(
Could not get it adjusted to where it fit comfortably. Will be returning.
The bottoms were not what I expected. The bottoms did not seem like shorts at all. I would have loved this product if in fact the bottom were shorts because I would get more coverage.
"I have two pairs of these; I bought the second because I really liked the fit and style of the first.  But, the second pair only lasted about six months, and then inexplicably split wide open up the rear!  I have no idea what caused it, all I did was sit down on my couch."
"Good quality material but these do not fit the same as other pairs of cuddl duds I have owned. I have 5 pairs of cuddl duds and I wear an XL and they always fit great with a little extra room. I purchased this pair in a 1x and was nervous they would be too large, instead they were too small. They are very short capri-length pants and do not stretch like the other pairs I have owned."
"I bought these to wear for work as a bartender. I've worn through half of them on their first use. My toe keeps poking through them. I know these aren't heavy duty socks, but they should last more than one use. Definitely looking elsewhere for socks."
"This is such a cute bathing suit...but it's short. I ordered the XXXL (48 inch hips, 36 inch waist, 44 inch chest) size 18 pants, 38DDD bra...and if it was about 4 inches longer in the torso it would fit, but I cant even get it to stretch enough to come close to covering my boobs."
gloves did not hld up well after several months...they are warm but i've already had to repair holes and fix spots that are coming unsewn
This was for a baby!
Returned it. It didn't look anything like the photo.
bottoms fit will well but I had to return it because the top was way too small. Really nice suit but the top didn't fit.
"Fits well,l. I don't wear jeans often, so was surprised when a belt loop separated form the jeans on the second wearing. I would have expected more durability from Wrangler"
The bag is adorable. But it came with fabric separated from the seam. I sent two emails to the Seller to inquire about a return and they did not respond. I'm disappointed because my instinct was that it was cheaply made. I was right and don't expect it to last long.
"I read some of the reviews and some people say these shrink. So, I was careful and only put it in the dryer for 5 minutes and hang dry the rest of the time. Well, it shrunk vertically TWO INCHES!! The width is fine, but I hate short shirts. Buy two sizes bigger if you must buy these, but I don't recommend them."
"These shoes are adorable!  They would be comfortable too if they were actually wide.  I wear a wide, ordered a wide, and these shoes HURT!  I passed them to a friend who actually orders a narrow and she LOVES them.  She says they might be the most comfortable flats that she has ever worn.  I wish the wide width was wide enough for my foot.  Don't bother ordering if you have a wide foot."
"Very unpredictable sizing, was way too loose in the arms, too baggy for a shirt and too short for a dress. Absolute fail."
Returned. Way too see through for white scrubs.
"Terrible! Does not look like picture. First of all the arms fit weird. Too short and stiff around arm pit. Then theres a ton of material in the middle. Its heavy, bulky, and incredibly unflattering. If I were pregnant with triplets this would be great! However, Im not pregnant and don't need the excess material. This dress gets a major thumbs down."
"These shiny, scratchy capris are not worth the (admittedly low) price. They are cheaply made and highlight every defect. They feel gross and the fabric is thin. Spend a little more and get something better."
For some reason they fit small been wearing timberland pro titan boots for 6years always wear 9m?
"Nice soft material, however if your bra is not a 100% perfect fit, your bra line will be visible. Disappointing.  I ordered a small (5' 9"" 145 lbs) and it does fit, but I wouldn't want it any larger.  It comes down to my mid thigh.  Great if you plan on wearing with leggings, but probably too long otherwise.  Some frays in the stitching when it arrived, but I expected that for the price.  I didn't get the discount, so this is actually an honest review."
need return authorization
"I think  I  received  the wrong  band. It  is  a  dark blue  and  white. I ordered a light  blue.
This band is very bulky and uncomfortable.
More of a man's military  style. To much trouble  to  return."
"I didn't realize that this was an ""outlet version"" of a jacket.  The print doesn't match up at the seams (anywhere!) and it doesn't really drape correctly on the body... but if you need something to wear around the house / run to the grocery store, then it's good enough.  If you work in an office - not really appropriate."
"It runs small. I am going to have to return it for a larger size. It didn't fit my daughter feet and she is a size 5! I got a 61/2 and still was too small. I wish they use one measurement for all shoes. Why don't they just say the insole has ""X"" number of inches."
"This is very very cute and I was very excited to get it.  However, it is still cute but I would consider it a size 0 or smaller.  It looks as though to fit a small child.  It was still very attractive though."
"I didn't get what I ordered.  At all.

I ordered the Charcoal version, but it was more of a sweatpants dull gray.  it fit well (which was awesome!) but it wasn't patterned well AT ALL.  The material was cut at the wrong angle; there were a TON of seams (I'm talking seams everywhere!); and, there was definitely no longer point in the front like it shows in the picture.

It was cheap so I guess I can't complain too much, but I would have preferred it to be cheap cute instead of cheap and ugly."
If you have any kind of tummy at all you will not want to get this. SHOWS ALL!
Adorable but fit VERY small...
"Runs really small, will shrink almost 2 sizes after you wash it."
I'm a classic size 10 and these were WAY TOO SMALL. SOOO disappointed!
"These are not large in the waist, but they extremely, extremely long.  They fell at least 2 inches below my son's knees, maybe more.  There is no indication, that I can see, for an inseam.  Other than that, I would've really liked these."
Don't waste your money. Didn't even have them out of the plastic wrapping and both big stones on both earrings had fallen out. They look like something you could buy at the dollar store. Cheap junk!
Cheap cheap cheap! Threads! I feel stupid for paying this much for such crap.
"This has to be THE worst product I bought on Amazon, and I do shop a lot.
I am 36DD and I purchased DD 2-pack. I only tried beige bra and here are the findings:
- first of all the bra has no shape! Zero! So it would not hold your breast in place if you have anything over B cup.
- the sticky material on the inside REALLY sticks to your skin and was almost painful to take off.
- there is not enough coverage on the sides so basically top sides of your breast are sort of hanging out.
There are plenty of strapless bras out there and this is definitely not the one you want to spend your money on."
Cheap shoe and the right one dug into the bridge of my foot so bad I embarrassed myself horribly at a job interview
"The ""large"" size socks we ordered were ridiculously small and totally unusable.  Thanks, Amazon, for taking them back.  Quality seemed to be OK; probably would be a 3-star if they fit."
"used once looks like it will break
the pin"
They did not fit the top of your foot . There was a large gap . Very disappointed. This was my second pair of Clark shoe boots that had a terrible fit.?
I didnt't like the material.  Too heavy and not enough gold
"If I could post zero stars I would. Absolutely not what the picture looks like, it is literally a piece of foam with eye holes cut out and two pieces of fabric sewed on to tie around your head. My ten year old could make this. Will be sending them back."
"It is a little difficult for me to rate these socks, seeing as how I never actually GOT these socks...I don't blame the seller though, it truly was the carrier's fault..."
I normally wear 16-18 so I purchased a 3xL and I guess because of my thick thighs I can't pull it all the way up. If it wasn't for that I would be ok.
Returned due to inconsistent coloring
"Size ran one size to small.  Toe bed was very tight.  Love my other OBOZ, and was excited about a lightweight pair.  Very disappointing ."
I ordered a large to get sleeve length and should have ordered a XXL. I am 5'10 and 135 pounds and thus sweater was so small it would be embarrassing to wear in public unless under something.
too small. very hard to take it off after working out. None of the Head bra I bought is elastic. Don't recommend.
was not satisfied with the item
Runs large in size and retiring it is like 15 steps I don't have time for...save yourself the time and just don't buy it.
"Cute style, but the quality is very poor. I probably could've sewn something like this together...and that's not saying much."
Very flimsy and straps came off so soon. I guess you cannot expect much for that price
"They fit okay and are cute, but the elastic ripped cleanly off one within 6 weeks, and the PACT website kept crashing when I tried to submit a notice about it. Really wanted these to work out (the other one seems to be of higher quality and is comfy and not see through )"
"I bought this since there's a high stars reviewed on it.  Item is too large, especially at the breast area.  Even those, I'm a size DD the breast area still too loose.  Disappointed.  Can't use it.  Will not buy this again ever."
Way too small stone.
"This is the worst product I have ever ordered on Amazon. It is flimsy, with stitches that are wavy and not straight. It was falling apart as I took it out of the envelope it was shipped in. It is extremely poorly made, and I will NEVER be buying again. DO NOT EVER EVEN THINK OF BUYING THIS! IT'S AWFUL EVEN FOR THE PRICE!"
"Not a good walking shoe for me anyway!  Needs more cushion and they so narrow that I'm unable to fit a pair of my own sole inserts, so I am giving them to Goodwill!!"
"I used this from my walk into LAX to the  KLM terminal,  Then Amsterdam Schiphol terminal to train in same building and from the train two blocks to the hotel, and we noticed one wheel not cooperating, While on the ship I saw it was 3/4 worn down compared to the other back wheel, or the front.
I can't return it because I had to buy another suitcase to replace this one and left this on the Viking River Cruise ship to be tossed. My choices for refunds are limited to returning the suitcase or exchanging the suitcase of which neither works for me.
I have another Lucas case and it is still perfect several trips with lots of towing, Major flaw on the wheels for this one, Fair Warning,,,"
"WEIRD material!  Sticky, rubbery pants, not very stretchy!  Loose stitching hanging from bottom of top.  Hard to believe this is a Disney authorized product!  It's cute, but not good quality!"
the item was returned
Ordered the coral color and the color does not match the picture. It has much more sheen and has too much pink in it compared to the photo. Disappointed. Didn't come in a nice box like some reviewer mentioned. Came in clear plastic bag.
"Terrible fit, cheap material.  Yuck."
they fell apart allreaddy only 3 times anywere else would refund my MONEY now i hope u do
"Pros: cute, and keep feet toasty warm.

Cons: A size 8-9 is more like a 10 or 10-1/2. And they do stretch within a week or two so factor that in as well. I can't even wear them now with a heavy sock. I threw my money away on these and should have returned them as soon as I received them. Now they're going in the donation bag."
"The dress was a really lovely color, I was disappointed that the cut of the dress didn't match the picture. I ordered a small based on reviews and sizing but even then it was too large. I wound up returning it."
"The fan engine burned out. I tested the fan once when the costume arrived, for about two minutes, and then once on the afternoon of Halloween for about two minutes.  Other than that, I only used it once I got to my Halloween party.  After about 30 minutes it died.  I put in fresh batteries, and the fan turned on, but with little to no air-output.  I put in a second set of fresh batteries just to be sure, and got no result.
Cool costume in theory, but once the fan goes out you're wandering around all night with a limp Yoshi."
"BOUGHT THIS WATCH IN 2009 AND MY BATTERY DIED LATE 2011,NOT A TEN YR. BATTERY. MAYBE A NEW BATTERY WILL LAST THAT LONG,AND WHO KNOWS HOW MUCH THAT WILL COST,WE'LL SEE.OTHERWISE A GREAT WATCH."
i liked the material but it fit like a size med
"The shirts do have a nice material but for some reason they are very baggy and the neck is really big, I ordered the 4 pack of comfort blend black and grey v necks (medium) and they fit fine while the white comfortblend shirts (I also ordered in medium) for some reason are like wearing a grain sack with arms, too baggy!"
"Super cute but the fit was extremely weird. These would be great for extremely wide, stubby feet. The quality is like something you'd find hanging on a discount slipper rack at Wal-Mart."
"Really nice hat but way too small. Must be nice for women or children, not big men,"
They look nice. But right out of the box you can see the posts are bent. I bent them back slightly but judging from how thin and flimsy they are I'm sure they'll fall of sooner than later. Pending a replacement of better quality I don't see buying from this company again. I ordered a pair for my niece from another seller for the exact same price and they were top notch !
Labeled 2XL but was maybe a Large or a Medium
"For full figured women this is a bad buy. This runs smaller cupsize than advertised. It does not give any support or shape. This is just a glorified version of pasties. One positive thing abt this product, it sticks very well to the body for atleast two times."
"The model must be like 6'7"""
"Sleeves way to long, girth just fits. Deep color purple great."
"Seem good quality, however not true to size. I ordered medium and it was too large."
"Snug.  Also, while the shorts are labeled 100% cotton, they are a cotton/poly blend.  The waistband covering is all polyester."
"maybe my foot is shaped odd for the standard but my toes couldn't reach all the way to the front and my heal was hanging out the back. I found that this was the case with other Teva flip flops.
I normally fit well in a size 7 or 8 but never have I had to try on a size 9 for the perfect fit.
Apparently Teva flip flops will be my first. I don't care as long as that size fits."
Too small and pinched
"I don't really like them. I don't like the way they fit and the front pockets are way too small. I ordered khaki and the color is definitely not khaki it's like a weird green color . The waist is tight, I'd definitely go up a size"
"This coat runs small, particularly in the sleeves. I don't know how they expect anyone to wear a sweater or any other winter clothing under this coat. I was very disappointed."
"They are cheap glasses the screw popped out leaving them unusable. Didn't waste any money, but not buying again."
"yuck shrink after first wash, no wonder they are so cheap"
"The watch is really large. I have small wrists and it was too large around the dial and too stiff to fit well around my wrist. It was not flush with my skin. Other than that, really nice looking watch, but definitely better for someone with larger wrists."
"i ordered a size up as mentioned in other reviews but still this top is a little too tight for me and the sleeves are very lose. i am 5' 4"" tall and 150lbs. usually i fit into a Medium size . i ordered a L with this one but the fit is definitely weird. Also the lace looks cheap! i am definitely returning this top ASAP!"
"VERY CHEAPLY MADE!! Makes you cross eyed when looking through them. I did not expect a $100 quality, but I've bought sun glasses for $5 that were better than these."
Not really what i was expecting for that price.
Somewhat small on top and big on the bottom...
"Cheap cheap quality, bow was glued on and when it gets wet, comes apart."
"I actually loved this design. It was beautiful in person as well, but within 2 days the first blue ""stone"" next to the center fell out. Extremely disappointing. I guess you get what you pay for."
How are these for a baby! More like toddler!!
"This item I ordered in orange and it was perfect. So I ordered this one in green and it was not even the same material and NOT the color pictured. In fact, items although both ordered on the same page came from different sellers. This one seemed to come directly form China. The first was prime but I had not noticed the second was not. They would not rectify this purchase. What a disappointment. I still want one like the one pictured in green if it was the light sweater material as the one is orange was. But I don't dare to try again without the guarantee of prime returns. Such a shame. It's as if these Chinese manufacturers just think any old material using the same pattern is acceptable. Th echeap clingy material in a wrong (bight odd green) color could not compare to the loose and sophisticated flow of the of the light sweater material."
"these were fun... while they lasted. bought two at the mall and then purchased from amazon , as well. they all got pinhole leaks within about 3 days.  not worth it!"
"Disappointed - when ordered it indicated M was 34-36, but the item received said M 32-34.....so now he has to go to the hassle of returning"
"It has drawstrings with no elastic. Because it has no elastic in the waist, the drawstrings need to be tied, then untied, etc."
Too small. Doesn't stretch/give.
"I have been wearing sandals most of the year for several years now. First, these were a little small v. my Merrell's. They were comfortable, but the material on the footbed of the sandals apparently trapped bacteria and had these smelling so bad that I had to throw them away. I tried using wet wipes, soap and water, drying them, etc., but nothing could keep them from stinking. You might say it's me, but I've never had this problem with any other sandals I've ever worn in the last 30 years."
"Material hard and stiff
Not what I expected.  The material is hard and stiff and the adjusting guide scratches the back."
"Terrible!! my blouse is dirty, the quality is 50%.
Im not happy "
I received my scrubs and noticed they are med.i order large..I needed them asap.and now I have to send these back.
The size is much smaller than most other Shirts marked Large.
"While I think these are as comfortable as my other Dansko clogs, the toes are scuffed after only a few weeks of wear. I wouldn't buy these again."
"the cut of this shirt is too small compared to carhardts and others that i have , also shrinkage was too much"
This was not a good buy for me.  The large flap is not easy in - easy out.  Maybe good for someone who like the flaps.
"These arrived quicker than expected which was awesome but I only received one star stud and three of the black & white striped ones. Also as far as the width they are very small, I do not have thick ear lobes and they barely screw on tight. One more thing, they stand out from the ear too much so don't expect them to be mistaken for real plugs. Overall they are still cute and I plan on wearing them.

Update January 2015: I changed my rating to one star because I cannot wear these earrings. They hurt my ears so bad, the metal chips off all the time and I just had to throw them all away. I know these are cheap but don't waste your money on them!"
"Fit fine. Material a little cheaper than expected. Lapel doesn't lay down as nicely as I would have liked, even after pressing"
"Nice product, sizing is way off"
Destroyed by a flood before uae
Cute boot but was to small. I'm not use to not have a zipper on boots so hard for me to put on. I really liked the style but I didn't reorder because of the hassle of getting in the boot but I'm sure if you are use to wearing a boot like this it is no problem.
Cheap material!!
"Too big, returned them"
"Purchased this and returned it. The stitching was substandard and missing entirely in one place. Functionally looks like it would be fine, but I was not happy with the quality of this product. You at least want a decently made product. this was not it."
"I got these for my fiance. He hates them. They run too tight (and he's a skinny guy) on the medium, the fabric isn't comfortable, and are too short to be worn comfortably. The cotton poly blend isn't very breathable. For the price, it does ok for a ""laundry day"" pair of underwear. But unfortunately I couldn't recommend these underwear."
"I do not like the product though apparently looks good quality and well with the presentation of it, but I like the lyrics because no passport are not well made"
This product has been greatly cheapened........nylon now 50% (was 63%) - polyester now 40% (30)  spandex 10% (7%) - band that goes around is narrower and only has 3 hook and eyes in back instead of 4 in the larger sizes....assembled in Mexico instead of Hondouras - not nearly as comfortable as it used to be.  Quality less - but not price - what I call what has happened to many products (including Jockey briefs I used to love) - over priced and under qualitied..  This review was written by Mrs. Jodlowski after ordering product and trying it on.
This is silk. Not what I expected and did not fit. But it is a very cute little summer piece.
"Loved the bag on Amazon, but when I received it was damaged and it looked cheap. I sent it back."
"This wallet is cheap looking, small and nothing like I expected. I'm very disappointed. It's getting returned. Don't waste your money.  You'll regret it."
"The tongue has been cutting into my leg. I'd return them but I wore them on a bike and are all dusty now. I know there is a break in period but I've had them for two weeks already. These shoes don't breathe either, get ready for sweaty feet."
it has no fill. Is difficult for my to use it without fill.
"Fits well, however, after the first washing, the strings to the hood became unraveled and this makes the jacket look ""old"", in my opinion.  The material also did not was well, there was some pilling after first wash.  I would not buy this jacket again."
"XL Size. 100 percent Rayon very thin material, pocket pattern to body shirt good match, woody buttons are ok.
The pattern looks ok from a distance. Delicate wash cold hang to dry ... too small.
Collar scrunched up feels weird. Overall not happy.
Definitely need a XXL."
"Not anything like the Hobo quality that I am used to. The leather was very stiff at th top, which makes the whole bag slump in. Doesnt stand on its own. Returned."
I have had this for only 3 months and the lining for the compartments is already coming apart.
"They fall down at the top, or curl up. The material is cheap and uncomfortable. Not what I wanted at all"
I don't like it. I'm actually sending it back. We bought them in 3 different colors and they are all going back. They don't jingle as loud as you would think because the coins are sitting so far apart from each other.  I'm actually learning more about hip scarves as I research them. But these are not as loud as they could be. My daughter and I take a Zumba class and I can barely hear them.
"I needed this last minute for a friend,I expected it to be cheap,But it is NOT light blonde as was listed when i bought it,it is neon yellow. So beware the color,if you need bright yellow then you are set."
poor quality and was incomplete would not recommend but unable to return due to family emergency
We gave them away to her niece.
"I loved these Bobs, but unfortunately they were too narrow for my Flintstone feet.  I normally wear a 6.5 but ordered a 6 based on other reviewers' suggestions to size down.  They looked like they would have been fine length-wise although I can't say for certain since I couldn't even get my foot fully into the shoe."
A rinestone fell out with in second of putting it on
stones get lose fast...my wife used for a few times and it's all gone.
"Uncomfortable. Can't stand in them very long. They are not structured enough to run or even walk long distances in. Not ventilated well at all. Runs small.
Tried to wear them in a little, but still very stiff. The arch is not supportive at all and the heel cup is way too shallow.
If it wasn't for the reasonable price and style of this shoe, this review would most definitely only have one star."
"Not well made.  The eye piece fell off when I removed the goggles from the box and the band attaching the goggles was twisted.  I was very disappointed.  I know the price is not great, but I was hoping for something with a little more quality.  I will probably return them."
"I was skeptical and excited once I bought this shoe online. After being advice to do otherwise, I went with my purchase and received the shoe. It look wonderful, felt great, only one problem. IT WAS 1 1/2 SIZES BIG! I really liked the shoe, it looked great and was very comfortable. But, due to this sizing issue I returned it immediately. I should have read the reviews."
"These shoes look great but are really uncomfortable. I own several pairs of other styled Steve Madden shoes, the coloured straps on these are really uncomfortable and dig into you'd feet, they also get twisted up. Don't boher with these , there are far better wedges available."
It is a really BIG hat!  I don't like it very much but will keep it.  Might use it in the pool.  I would not wear it out.
"The dress is too short, the fabric is cheap and only good for a house dress. I don't know how to call the fabric bet it's the same used to make umbrellas. The worst is that it has no lining underneath it. It's shapeless and doesn't look like the sample. The colors are brightly printed on it though."
"As others have noted, these shoes are cute however they do have a major problem with comfort. The footbed of the shoe pushes against the inner arch and makes these shoes painful to walk in for more than a few steps - so much so that I am returning them. I don't normally suffer from foot pain and have never had this problem with any other shoe I've owned...but based on the reviews, these shoes seem to be comfortable for some people and not others."
"after I got it on and tightened up, the waist felt fine, but there was quite a bit of.....back fat hanging over the top, very unattractive.  Perhaps I need something a bit more different."
It is a pretty dress if you are a small and accidentally buy a large you will be happy. I normally wear medium but I wanted to make sure I had more room in this so I bought a large.... I waited a long time for delivery which is another complaint. If it wasn't for the fact I really expected this dress to be fabulous because it sure looks that way on the modal I would have canceled....What really throws me is I am NOT over weight I wear a medium only because of my bone structure I actually where a small in most shirts but choose medium for dresses.. so when you see the fit of the dress in the picture I had every reason to believe a large either work for me or but a good chance being too big! They must have put a Large on a girl who wears a size 0 to take this picture because either I just happened to get one of the few that passed the inspection without being inspected or these dresses are very very small... or they are made for kids / young adults but forgot to mention that... what ever the dress I got does not fit as a large in misses much less ladies... maybe a juniors.... I just went and looked at the dress again and now they have a warning that  may be TOO BIG??????  Wow.... so now you are roling a dice... it can be too big or too small.... good luck here..... I can not even tell you if it is made well or how it is after washing.... I have not been able to wear it. So my only reason for giving it 2 star instead of 1 is because it looks nice on a hanger at least.
Color did not appear as online!!!
Very attractive safety sneakers.  They run small and the insole can not be removed so custom orthotics don't fit.  That tidbit is not in description by seller. If you have to return - you have to pay return shipping!  Most shoe sellers offer free exchanges and returned.
"Nice pants. Size is way off. I bought size 8 for my tall 8 year old and the length looks like they're for 6 year olds. I compared the size 8'a to his 7x in the same brand, and they were literally almost a full 2 inches shorter than sz 7x! All three pairs that I received!"
"Horrible quality, horrible fit, surely no one would actually feel comfortable in this top!"
Shoes aren't comfortable on my feet - too tight. Not enough support. Seem to have be made with cheap materials. Not Merrell's usual high standards.
"I am very disappointed. The stones are pale green and do not look like emeralds; and certainly not like the stones in the photo on Amazon.com. They look like cut glass to me. Also they are flimsy. Very light and thin gold. Maybe that is all you get for over $100 but I am just so disappointed,and will return them."
Didn't have it for 2 weeks before the zipper broke!
I don't know what to do with this item.  My Wedding is on June 10th.  I'm afraid to order a smaller size and not get it on time.  Does not look like the one on line.  Cheap material.
Not a repeat buy.
"As with the black pair the first few times of wearing them was great, they gradually begun to stretch and now they are hard to keep on."
"I read many online reviews saying how comfortable this shoe is for working on concrete floors, it's NOT. I had purchased a different style of this brand in my normal size, and had to return it because it was too small. So for this pair, I ordered the next size up. It's too large and slops on my feet, I have to wear thick socks with it to avoid chafing. However, the insole is not at all comfortable, very little cushion. I wore them around the house for several weeks to break them in, and wore them to work in yesterday for the first time. My feet were killing me after six hours. The bottoms of my feet, especially under my big toes, were so sore, all I could think about was taking them off the second I got home. I do not recommend these unless you have extremely tough feet, or buy some gel cushion insoles for them. I would return them if I could, but since you don't know until you actually work in them, it's too late for me.  :("
"Very cheap material.  I don't think I will ever use it and it is just not worth sending back.  Order item on Jan 31.  Received it on March 10th.  I had more or less given up ever seeing it.  Yes I submitted feedback on vendor, but they kicked it back because I mentioned that the item was cheap material.  Just wanting to warn anyone looking that you get what you pay for, a very cheap item and well over 1 month to receive."
"The fit is really bad - folds at the crouch and looks funny. It is a relaxed fit, of course, but the way it looks around that area is strange. Moreover I did not quite like the material. Just stiff and thin."
Did not offer width in  4EEEE which i need. To narrow.
"XLarge, more like a small. The material is not as described and the fit is awful"
It's small.
"Im 56 and 127 lbs and ordered a Medium in Multi-pink. It was so small I couldn't wrap it more than an inch, so it was basically wide open in front.  You need about a 28 inch waist. I have no idea what size to order in exchange because it seems several sizes short of material. Its a beautiful dress and fits in the arms and back and might work as a fancy swim coverup but I wanted a wrap dress. No size tag on dress to very sizing."
"Chinsey, flimsy. Not sparkly enough. Good return though"
"For what I paid I guess this is to be expected. The boots are ok looking but feel light and cheap.

 I am sure any water exposed to the sole will be a problem as they feel like cardboard."
I tried these and my daughter kept getting inflamed. They are difficult to remove because you have to tear them or take your children's clothing off every use. I switched to huggies and have not had any skin issues since the switch
I returned these shoes because the heel did not have any support. It felt as though my heel sunk back in the shoe.
These were not at all what I expected and had to be returned.  Not made in proportion to American sizes.  Sorry.
"I normally wear a medium, so I ordered a large and I can't even button it."
So uncomfortable that i returned and then prayed to Allah for forgiveness
Uncomfortable.  Feels like stiff cardboard.  Wore once.  Probably won't wear again.
"Too small, my daughter told me to take a hike. Oh well."
this is sized to an Asian man. if you are tall don't get it
"*****Update 9/30/16 [7-8 months later]*****

As you can see from the pictures, these have holes within the first year.  I live in Philadelphia and we've had a relatively dry year until this week, so I've only worn these 20ish times.  Almost immediately after stepping outside this morning, I noticed my foot getting wet and the obvious hole in the side of my boot.  My fuzzy sock and tights were soaked by the time I got to work.

Very unhappy as I have a very difficult time finding rainboots that fit my calf and wide foot and from a comfort standpoint these weren't bad, but they are obviously lacking in quality.

****Original Review****

I measured my foot and calf prior to ordering, as I have wide feet and large calves.
My foot is 9"" long and wide, and my calves are 16.2"".
I ordered an 8 in the black without a buckle (Idk if that makes a difference), which is actually 9.6"".  They fit, lengthwise I have a thumb which is about 0.5"".  I could have comfortably gone with a 7.5, however, I am now reluctant to return, as width wise, they seem to just fit and the size chart does not provide width.  I actually would probably prefer a size down, as they are kind of heavy, but I don't want to risk it.  They fit my calf well, I can stick my hand down the side while I'm in."
Its White doeswnt look as nice as in the picture..
Fell apart really fast
"One of the wires broke, after three times wearing"
"I have never purchased this brand before but After reading the reviews I thought I'd give them a try. When you're a DDD/F $25 dollar bra's are hard to come by. I bought the size I normally buy and this was by far too small at the band. I have a bra extender for just these types of predicaments but the extender even at the smallest setting then made the band a little too loose, something I could have lived with if the way they shaped the cups didn't give me torpedo boobs. The last thing I'm looking to do with my hooties is poke someones eye out.  The lace on the outside felt like cheap awful tulle similar to what you find on wal-mart halloween costumes. I ultimately returned it. I bought&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frederick-s-of-Hollywood-NEW-Hollywood-Corset-Lace-Full-Figure-Bra-Womens/dp/B00EVA72XI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frederick's of Hollywood NEW Hollywood Corset Lace Full-Figure Bra Womens</a>&nbsp;at the same time as this bra and recommend it far above this one, it's a better brand, comparable in price, and much more saucy."
I retutned it too small.
I ordered the size 42 because I  already have the same belt size 42 but what was shipped to me was several inches shorter than my other Levi's size 42  belt.  A little disappointed I guess I will find somebody to give it to.  If you get the right size it's a great belt
"Shirt looksnice , but is super thin see through and I ordered an extra large and it could barley fit a 12 year old"
"Bra too small for adults, lace does not cover cleavage, too short"
I loved this watch so I finally went to shell out the money and get it as a Christmas gift. The sent me a completely different watch (not even a smart one) that was worth a quarter of this one. Just got fed up and bought one of the fossil website. Not I love my correct watch!
a little cheaper than expected...just ok
"Even 1 star more then what it deserve
Too bad quality, not fit at the body as it's shone
Not fit at all ..it's Piece of junk"
The dress is beautiful but if you have breasts bigger then an A cup the material will not cover you. It's only the triangles that are supposed to cover that are to small and I did have other women with smaller breasts try it on to make sure that was the problem. Otherwise I loved everything else about it.
Nowhere near big enough
"I needed a heating pad to help heal a shoulder injury, and I bought this believing it would fit snugly between my neck and the edge of my shoulder.  I was quite mistaken.  The pad seems to work reasonably well in the small of the back or across the back below the neck.  The control allows for a welcome range of temperature.  However, the location of the ""plug in"" for the electrical cord makes it cumbersome to use the pad.  A better design would be to have a cord come out of the pad for several inches before the electrical supply cord attached.  The only way I have been able to apply heat effectively to my shoulder with this pad has been to hold it into place with my opposite hand cupped to force it down onto the area.  The pad seems to be well made, and it heats effectively, but I would not recommend it for areas where the pad could not be fully extended flattened (and the plug-in would not interfere)."
These are made for a thinner foot than mine.  They are so cute!!  I would recommend these if you have a very thin foot.
Like the look of it but it scratches really easy unlike other titanium rings
Nice sweater but runs very small. Returning it
The leather is too stiff and rubs a sore around instep.  I plan to return them and look for more LuLus
painful
Fabric was soft and comfortable. But...may as well be invisible in this light color. Hated to return it but it would only be appropriate as sleepwear.
after 1 wash it shrank.
It didn't come with the pads that it was supposed to. It was smaller Than I thought it would be.
"This shoe has incorrect measurements, they claim the inches for a size 10 is 26 it's not, it's way smaller than that. I bought a size 10 and my foot would not go in at all and I have very narrow feet. I bought some shoes from stylelex a company their associated with and their shoes fit the same way. I should have known better. Disappoined"
Have had dozens of pairs of NB shoes. Aleays size 11. Had to return these for 11.5.
"I am very disappointed with these, they have a chemical smell that has not gone away after two washes. It is like diesel or gasoline. Also the colors faded considerably after the two washes. I am not putting these on my baby with such a bad smell. Will most likely return them."
"The sole is soft and comfortable, however the stretch on the top of the top stretches too much causing my feet to slip forward and can't wear."
The bale was not on straight.  The red one I bought was good though.
"I had brought this brand of uniforms before and it was never an issue but, for some reason this ones were huge on me. I like them but unfortunately too big for me."
Sent back!! Looked like a tablecloth!!  Did not like so would never give as a Christmas gift Si it was returned!!!
Looks like it's for a little girl!! Terrible fabric!
XXXL WOULD FIT A CHILD. SMELLED LIKE A HEAVY OIL/GASOLINE SMELL. I HAD TO THROW IT OUT. WASTE OF MONEY!
This was horrible. I thought I was going to wear this to a wedding in Hawaii but this dress shows all your lumps and bumps. It's too thin. Trashy.
"Pretty shoe but too narrow and I missed my return window to get a wider size. :-(  Would love to exchange them for a wider size, but now I'm stuck and definitely will not try these again since they're too tight."
Just got this the other day and I was a little disappointed with my order. It was cheap looking and I don't trust wearing it out. Have to return it
Really cheap and thin.  Do not buy.
"Fit large, even though I ordered down as size. Not flattering."
Disappointed in the fit...
Thin not good quality
This is by far not SLIM as described.  Not a very good product if you want a sleek / slim money clip
The quality is not very good. Thin bandage material
The fabric is cheap and scratchy. The sleeves are too tight and are only connected by a couple stitches. It was hard putting it on since the sleeves felt like they would rip off any second.
"Why I NEVER buy skinny jeans :(

I wear a size 12 pants, but these size 13 jeans feel like they belong to someone else. I can squeeze into them and I can button and zip them, but they ride too low for comfort and are WAY uncomfortable."
"I thought buying them a size larger would help and they look so cushy in the photos.  Wrong !!  they are hard, not cushy at all and I couldn't even get them on my feet.  They went right back needless to say !"
"""body"" of the panty way too large compared to waist/top and legs bands (yes, bands/elastics). Fabric is very thin. Looks good on picture but terrible in reality. To clarify, I usually take size 5 (or small). 5.5 and 130 lbs and pretty fit! to give a better idea to future buyers. These panties are not the best beside light weight! would not recommend them."
Upon receive tried it on and it had a hole on the leg. Very cheap quality you get what you pay for for sure.
I usually wear a medium/size 8 but these in a medium are VERY tight. I like the fleece but they are just too tight to sleep in. And too much hassle to return for the price.
Small holes after just one wash
"This is something I would buy for my niece... not for a grown woman. I was very disappointed after waiting two weeks to get these that they did not match the picture on this site... actual coloring is similar but with outlined stars and hearts that are currently not shown. Only reason I put two stars is for the fabric quality, stretchy comfortable, and it's not see-through!"
These are very tight shoes like having a tourniquet on your feet. I sent my pair back
"The first pair I bought was ok, save for turning fading all over everything in the washer the first time I washed them and the waist button failing the second time I wore them. I can't tell you much about the second pair I bought because it's been a month, and they haven't been shipped to me yet."
"Wayyyyyy too humongous, and not as good materials as some other water shoes out there. Also, these are not comfortable to walk on. I eventually went with rocsoc"
After one washing a XXL reduced down to a medium size.
"I am 5' 10"" tall and 230 lbs apple shaped body. This fit me around the bust but came 3"" above my knee at the shortest point and just 1 inch below my knees at the long front and back. But my biggest objection was the wired ugly S shaped stamps in bleach all over the beautiful tie dye pattern. It was stamped all over the front, but seeped through in spots on the back. Within this gorgeous blue and purple pattern were ugly pinkish yellow bleach spots and S's. Completely ruined the whole look. Disgusted and sent back."
"Be careful if you decide to buy this dress, I bought it XL size as usually, it is too small and short I'm 5,4"" and the dress fix under my need."
My last favorite scrub set out of many that I own. Material is thin. Lacking any useful pocket. Drawstring. Size is as expected but the fit is rather awkward. Wouldn't buy a pair for half the price.
Feels like cheap polyester. The back is quite low on the dress I got. The front exposes lots of cleavage and I'm not certain a bra can be worn under it.
The slippers are comfortable but run a little smaller than expected. They fit a little short but I'm sure they'll stretch a bit over time. Love the color and the softness of the inside. UPDATE: Ive had these slippers for a little over 1 month and Ive only worn them around my house and the bottoms are peeling apart. Very disappointingmy cheap slippers from Target lasted over 3 years longer.
Ordered up two full sizes and they were still way too small.  Don't waste your time buying missized shoes.
"It's too bad these jeans have such a giant fatal flaw, because they are good sturdy denim and well-made.  BUT the front pockets only go up to your first knuckle!  They won't even fit a credit card or a coin holder.  I can't imagine what the designers of useless features like this are thinking.  Maybe they think all women are supposed to carry their stuff in purses.  I guess I didn't get the memo.  (To me, a purse is an albatross!)

So, unless you only ever keep dimes and postage stamps in your front pockets,  I suggest you pick a different pair of black stretch jeans.

(I want to make sure I p[oint out that this is certainly not this individual retailer's fault.)"
"as soon as I took them out of the box I knew they were going to be small, I tried them on and they were really stiff. Didn't like the
look of them, a little different from the photograph on amazon, returned them immediately."
The shoes fit perfectly but the front top part keeps rubbing at my legs.  definitely returning it.
"I was so very excited about these shoes--they're cute, they're Jillian, and they're affordable!  I ran 2 miles on the treadmill this morning and did 3 miles on the elliptical, and my toes are bleeding.  The shoes are perfectly bouncy and supportive and light...but the base of the tongue is made of cheap plastic that cuts into the tops of your toes!  Another customer says it came ""unglued""?  Not sure, both of my shoes just showed up that way.  I hate sending them back because I was so stoked about my new shoes, but I think now I'll just go into a shoe store and shop around.

ALSO: someone said these run small, and she was right--I normally wear a size 6.5 (or 5 in children's), and I bought a 7, which was perfect.  Hope it helps!"
"I didn't return it because it is only $10 and I needed it to top my my expenses in order to get the 20% off discount. It is the cheapest ""shoe"" I can by at the shoes department!"
"I wanted to love these! The quality of the leather is great, the style is adorable but the heel to ball of foot arch was just too steep. It was my mistake purchasing them, I know when I wear a 4"" or higher heel I need at least a small platform. If not it's uncomfortable to walk. If you don't have this issue then definitely buy them, they're gorgeous!"
"CHEAP CRAP ! Size run way small , not waterproof for very long  ,,maybe 1/2 hr walking in the rain before your feet are wet!
And they are worn out already ! The rubber has  completely wore off the heel already .CHEAP CRAP FROM CHINA"
"Did not last, poor stitching and leather"
CLing Cling Cling! Yuck!
Not just too large; gigantic.
These are not as nice as the ones I bought even last year.  Cheaply made and the top strap is too long and doesn't do anything to hold the foot in place.  Will be the last pair I buy.
"Bought as a vacation ring. The sizing is off as we would have exchanged it. I was measured in the jewelry store under a 7. We ordered this ring as a 7 and it did not fit at all.  By the time we realized this, it was too late to return it. A waste....."
"Poorly made , way off in sizing."
The fitting and the fabric are not good.
I was expecting the fleece lining to be a bit thicker than what these are...I have purchased better leggings that cost even less than these!
"I do not like this shirt at all! It's not tshirt material at all. I have several shirts like this, they are all tshirt material but not this one. I can't find a tag that says what it's made of but it's slick material. Too hot for summer, don't breathe at all!"
wrinkles Big Time
"Extremely disappointed, literally received this in the mail on 2/15/17 wore it once and this is what happened after one wash. This shirt is not going to last one more wash. Poor quality"
I ordered these in a size 10.5 wide (husband normally wears this) and the shoe too small and far too narrow in the wide. Not impressed.
Shoe did not fit as advertised. The shoe does not provide adequate arch support.
"Not as comfortable around the neck and shoulder area. The fabric is cut in 90* angle, it's pooling down, and makes very uncomfortable to were, I have to lift the shoulder parts up every so often because of the pooling and acquired starching of the fabric.
I wish I could return it, but I didn't try until it was too late to return."
"I really want to love these shoes. They are so pretty. They match endless outfits... my fianc commented I love your Cinderella slippers. The reason for the 2 star review: blisters. Although very pretty, they are not comfortable. Even wearing at during a day I had mostly paperwork to do and not much walking, I had to put bandaids on the back of my heel at like 9:30. So pretty, so painful. Like mama said, glass slippers will give you blisters. I will still wear them because they are so cute, and I wear preemptively bandaid appropriately. Beauty is pain."
"These are Silver-""toned"" and Gold-""toned"" earrings with wire hooks of questionable material makeup.  I was so disappointed, I returned them.  If you don't mind jewelry that looks like it was dipped in silver and gold colored paint, they are sorta fun.  However, they are very noisy!  While trying them on, I could hear a LOT of jangling of the hanging rings."
Not impressed with these scrub pants. they tend to run small and are very slim throughout the thigh area.
"Bought these for my son who always wears dickies. They are in a box somewhere. Had to order more Dickies. He is hard to fit. For big and tall workwear, go with the Dickies."
"The pink color is very bright. Returning is a nightmare and expensive. Does not look as pictured , would not recommend"
"Unfortunately it is quite narrow in the shoulders, narrow enough to have to send back.  The material is very nice and does wrinkle easily, had it laying on my dresser before trying it on again and deciding I couldn't live with it. What a shame, I love Mordenmiss.
Note: narrow shoulders are a big problem Im running into a lot lately with Chinese cooler weather clothes."
Worn less then 10 times and it's starting to fall apart.
Just ugly and the laces won't stay down. I wish I could take them back!
"My ears are at exactly 6mm, all other plugs fit my ears. However I cannot get these in. Maybe my own fault? Perhaps I should have gotten a size down in order for these plugs to fit along with the base flare?"
Not at all true to size. Runs very small and very short. I wish I would've read all of the reviews before purchasing. Looks way better on the model than in person. I ordered a size bigger than I normally get anywhere else and it was still too small.
Ordered these xl socks for my husband. He wears size 16 shoes and I have a real hard time find xl socks that are truly xl. These have a small amount of stretch and are very narrow. They were very tight to get on and he didn't want them as the would be too tight if they shrunk at all. With men having larger feet you would think they would come out with xxl socks for those with size 16+ feet.
"Oofos are amazing. This has eliminated my lower back pain. I ordered a 3rd pair and the sizing is completely inconsistent. I always order my regular W8 and the black pair is HUGE! Its actually quite dangerous when I wear them because I trip over the extra sole at the front. I reached out to the company but they said they cant replace them because I bought them over a year ago. Since I had 2 other pairs, I wore those out before wearing the one that is too largeit was in storage. I emailed them pictures comparing the regular 8 with the incorrect 8 and they said there is nothing I could do. Im very disappointed by Oofos."
"I ordered this for my daughter for Christmas, but I'm sending it back and getting a different one.  It's pretty enough, but the ""jewels"" are cheap looking flat-back pins that have hot glue covered in glitter on them.  The dress laces up in the back (so no independence when getting this dress on).  And, the deciding factor: it has really stiff netting inside.  There's a layer of satiny material closest to the legs, but not enough, so I'm SURE I'd be hearing about how itchy it is.  The dress is pretty, but not pretty enough to cover the defects and the price."
"They ARE slate grey; NOT black. And Shoe Buy charges a $6.95 ""restock"" fee, which is not mentioned in the return policy.
So beware. I have 5 other pairs of Fit Flops and LOVE them, but these were definitely not what I expected and their
customer service person was rude! Fortunately Amazon was able to able to give me a credit."
Sole is crap in freezing weather...cracks at seams.
"Very small, and narrow not long at all .If your looking for a wrap this is NOT A WRAP.This is more like a scarf for the neck it is a very sheer ,Silk Neck scarf."
runs very  small
"Not happy with these shoes, but didn't find out until tried wearing them all day at work.  The heel folds in when slipping on and they didn't hold my orthotics very well.  would have returned, but had worn them."
"These don't work for me. Fine if I want to wear with a sweater or something loose-fitting, but if I plan on wearing something a little tighter, the petal creates pokey shapes and lines from where it has adhered."
"I hate them, I wish I had sent them back"
Quick delivery but thats all good I have to say. The cat and bear socks had a loose cat and bear and they fell off the socks within minutes of wear. The most upsetting was the cow socks have zero rattle in them at all. I would be returning these if it wasn't that my child would get upset so Ill see the rattler heads back on myself.
"Beautiful, but several sizes too small."
"The wrists on this are far too tight! Super cute, but we ended up picking a new one."
"We bought this for cosplay, my goddaughter liked it and needed it for a costume. It fell apart the first time she wore it. Tried to fix it so it looked like the character she liked and it was so thin, hair kept falling out."
Very disappointed and was returned.
For someone with plantar fascittis these do not work.
Rather strange looking and feeling. I'm content with the Keens I have. These felt odd.
"Too small, cheap material, super itchy!"
SO TINY you cant even read it
Backpack straps pulled out of backpack about 45 days after purchase.
"very small, I always wear 7, never goes up to 7.5 and above, but these are small, can't fit, but don't want to waste more money returning them"
Too large and bad quality
"I like Colombia pants, this is my second purchase of these pants.  However, this particular pair is not the size I ordered, they are too small.  Always frustrating not getting what you ordered....the label inside the pants have one size while all the tags that hand on the out side have the numbers which i wanted.  unfortunately the label inside (too small) indicated the actual size of the pants."
Not the colors that were shown.  Got a completely different set of colors.
Crappy glasses. Terrible lenses that glare and disturt. Frame that pinches. Overall quite bad. Sending back.
"The costume I received had to be returned because the zipper was partially sewn together, right in the middle of the torso, making it impossible for anyone other than a contortionist to get it on without causing damage.  That aside, I concur with other reviewers about the quality of the fabric - awfully see-through, and being fairly tall, the sleeves barely passed my elbows.  The seller accepted my return of such a time-sensitive purchase.  However, I was required to pay return shipping, which almost didn't make it worth returning."
"These fit but they said non control top which is what I needed...however the ones I recieved still had the darkened/thick control top, and therefore couldn't be used for what I needed. Nice qualify, not what thought I ordered."
"I run about 4 to 5 days a week, 3 to 4 miles. I noticed that by mile 2, my feet are significantly sweatier in these socks than my other athletic socks. I really wanted to love these socks because I loved the style and colors that come in the pack but I won't be reaching for these anymore."
Shoes are not good for running. My feet started burning within three minutes running. I packed them up and send them back.
I bought these for my daughter. She likes to be with her dad around the farm and I wanted her to have some safe footwear. When she saw them she was very happy. We both liked the look of them and they're waterproof too. She started wearing them right away. Then her ankles started to hurt so badly that she had to take them off and now she won't wear them at all. I'm going to get her some real thick socks to see if that helps but if not I guess it was a lot of wasted money. I wish I had not bought these.
After the purchase at first I thought it was a nice slipper to wear. I am  in shape average user . I wear  the slippers only when I come home from work normal wear and tear I purchase them in september this is november and they already falling apart tearing from inside the seams the under part of the shoe is wearing out  they are absolutely cheap garbage something made in china to be sold on a street corner do not waste your time don't let the cheap price fool you remember a you get what you pay for. I  learned my lesson with these pieces of garbage right in the trash.
"Really cheap looking, I returned them. I want better boots 4 myself."
"Horrible BRIGHT KELLY GREEN with BRIGHT YELLOW polka Dots! Oh my! Not ""Aqua"" in the least. Not one tiny bit! If those are your colors, then this is your dress."
Bought three of these online...different manufacturers and honestly these are more for men. The neckline is high and these shirts are not long enough or tailored for a woman. I gave one to my 18-year old son. Only wear the others around the house.  Disappointed as I followed the reviews.
Wasnt what i spect
Returned them. Didn't like cloth
Didn't like the quality of the material. Too hot.
Fine if you are a thin 8 year old- possibly they mean for this to be a bracelet??? It seemed to be well made- but I was very disappointed that it was no not usable- even on a 24 yr. old THIN male
"They don't stay up without the garterbelt
THAT DOESN'T COME WITH THEM!!!"
I bought a white pro xp and also the regular white dansko. Both have such small toe box. I have shoe bite if I wear for more than 5 hours. Also I wore it so can't return them. I did remove the cushion on the arch so as to make it roomy. Pro xp is slightly roomier although not much of a difference. I am 36. I bought 36. Runs too small. My feet not so wide. I never had trouble with other brands.
This product comes from China and the sizes are like for a child that are way too small. Doesn't fit right and it's going right in the garbage. Don't spend your money on this.
"Good fit and support, but a seam is coming undone, this is the second pair of shoes that is has happened to"
"I ended up returning them for a refund.  Not as soft as I expected, so was disappointed."
Awful product. Should've known you get what you pay for
I used evryday and after two weeks got scratches and stopped working
"I wear a B in every other bra I own but in this bra the cup had just a bit of wiggle room which made the fabric not lay well and therefore presented a bumpy look, and that's beside the fact that the cups are sewn in a way to make them a bit triangular instead of rounded anyway.  The shape is off enough that it is noticeable through your shirt.  Other than that...the thing itched me SO bad I took it off the second I got home from work and never intend to wear it again.  A bra is most definately something that needs to be made of soft comfortable material.  I bought the bra for the posture support, but I didn't feel as if it helped my posture at all.  There just didn't seem to be a strong enough structure there to truely assist with posture.  Unfortunately this purchase was a big fail for me!"
These boots were paper thin.  I would not purchase these at all!! I returned them.
They were uncomfortable especially in the toe. It was as if the toe was not formed correctly.
Don't like the spandex material
"BEWARE... coat is not Down as advertised. The description needs to be changed. In addition, the coat I received had a hole along the outer seam of the arm. Despite these things, if the jacket was advertised correctly and free of defects, it is a cute & flattering jacket."
narrow for a Keen shoe.
"Size is off, not as expected. Cheap made. I do not recommend it."
"These are beautiful, comfortable, and fit exactly as expected HOWEVER I suggest wearing them for short events and NOT on days when you're out running errands. I've been a spandex/biking short wearer for years in order to prevent the chub rub and was really looking forward to feeling some air flow! The day started off well however by the end I could see where my skin had pushed through the design and rubbed raw, leaving a floral imprint of tiny cuts/hot spots on my inner thighs. I suggest limiting wear time to ~2 hours or less."
Wares out quickly
"Super narrow. Not comfortable at all. The shoe fit OK at first, but I can't wear them for more than an hour without pain because the sole is so firm and narrow."
It's inexpensive which is nice but it's very stiff and scratchy
I'm 5'5 and 155lbs. This doesn't make me look sexy...it makes me look like a caterpillar.
"Aside from being too tight in the vamp, the Amazon photo shows a nice turquoise/teal...the shoe came to me in NAVY blue. I never wear navy blue. These are going back."
The color in reality is not as bright as in the picture online. I will send it back.
Muks Luks are the best slippers ever for winter. I've owned several pairs. But I was shipped a pair that was a 7 on the left foot and a 5 on the right foot. See attached photos
This brand of shoe does not run consistent . The 37 was too small and the 38 much too large. They were returned . My recommendation is try them on in a store and if they fit buy them. If you order them online the fit is not going to be the same in the same shoe as they are definitely aren't consistent !
"I bought this hat specifically to use to block the sun. It fits very loosely and there is no way to tighten it. Therefore,
with the slightest wind, it blows off."
This is the worst looking shirt on me that I've ever seen. LOL
tight shoes
"1. the description says ""brand new"" and the pair I received had clearly been worn, and not just tried on: there were some scuffs near the sole around the toe box.
2. nowhere in the description does the seller clarify that a return will get a PARTIAL refund, about 80%"
"These run a size bigger, which is fine if I didn't have to argue back & forth with Amazon to get a Prepaid label.  I wound up having to call to get a label, I am overseas and it would have cost me a lot of money to ship these back, especially when the listing states ""true to size."""
"These are wool which is very itchy. I really wanted to like them but I can't wear them for long before the itchiness drives me crazy. I tried washing them to soften them up but it didn't work. And now I can't return them. Be forewarned, these are itchy slippers."
"The socks are good quality however they do not stay up around my calves, I suspect not enough elastic ?"
"These pants look good and have a nice feel. And, unlike many new slacks today, they are not lint magnets. And the fit is good. But what good is all that when holes quickly start developing (not tears or rips) in the fabric? The material starts wearing out after just a couple of months."
really not strong at all. Not comfortable either
Thankfully I have a size T2 toddler and can use it
This watch epitomizes the word faux. The dials are painted or stamped onto the face.
The large was about the size of a girls size 10. Perfect for my niece.
"More Pinkish than Maron
Booo doesn't match any of my maron outfits"
Too small and uncomfortable . I wore once and threw them out.
"I got all of the bags +1 extra 6 different colors 18 bags each color no fall colors (red, yellow, orange or black)"
Way too small. Too narrow. Too disappointing.
GOT THE WRONG PRODUCT AND NOT MY GLOVES
"Awful, so uncomfortable. I was probably better off leaving my heals on"
Shoe is too small and narrow. Forgot to return and now they will not take it back. I get I had a window but I lots going on. Now I am stuck with a shoe that i can't wear.
"This product was not what I was expecting. It is extremely short; I'm 5' 9"", ran slightly smaller than what was suggested, poorly stitched at the hem, and soiled with what looks like oil and a large area of smudged black ink. I attempted to wash it but it did not come clean. For the price, I am keeping it because I only wanted something to kick around the house in this summer anyway. I noticed another buyer received hers with black ink smudges as well so be prepared if your do buy this. It did wash up well; I line dried it. I haven't tried it on since I washed it. If it shrunk I will give it to my daughter. I may order another in a larger size and see if I get lucky."
"shrinks and poor quality fabric, thin"
"Unfortunately I am not having a good experience with these socks.  I bought them about a month ago and already a part on the heel is wearing a hole in it.  Additionally, they are too small despite that fact that my shoe size is 51/2.  They keep falling down and that drives me nuts, so I won't be buying these again.  I hope you have better luck."
"These were really odd, see-through-ish material. I would consider wearing them as pajama shorts but not out of the house. Too big for me, too, so they went back."
I wear a size small.  Knowing the material is tight fitting I ordered it in a size medium and it is still too small.
Returned them as it made my feet worse.  Trying to get rid of inflamed plantar facia. Not for everyone.
"Standard size runs small & although the colour is right, the criss-cross material that appears in the front part of the costume is actually in the back."
does not lay like picture - very cheap in appearance
I ordered a size M. The concept of the shirt was great but it was so long on me and im not too short 5'4. This shirt could go for a dress or a night gown. I reached a little above my knees. The material was very nice and light
"These shoes are too small, I will order a size 8 and reached a size 6"
"My skin is showing the effects of too much sun.  This shirt was intended to be the solution.  Sadly, it is not.  I was seeking a breathable shirt that fit.  This missed on both accounts.

It is WAY too large.  Size medium fit like an extra large.

And, the shirt like others of its ilk is very tightly woven with a synthetic fabric.  It's good a shedding wind but not good a being breathable.

The color is great, and the design okay.  Many shirts for outdoor (hiking?) use have weird pockets.  This one is no exception.  While fewer pockets would be better, this one looks okay -- better than those with expandable 'pillow case' pockets."
I am a medium (size 6) and I ordered a large figuring I'd be wearing a swim suit under this.  I found it to be poorly made and very clinging.  It was much longer than I expected for a cover up.
"could not read the time, too dark"
"This product fails to mention that it is for women.  Extremely misleading.  Whether by design or mistake, I through my money away on something I can't wear.  The title should read Camouflage Women's Joggers Sweatpants. Even the size chart just says  S M L LG etc...  If you think you know what size you wear you're doomed if you're a guy.  If you're confused, then and only then do you find out that they are WOMEN'S JOGGING Pants."
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.  cheap and the material stinks
"Too small, I emailed sellers for a larger size before shipping after reading the reviews and received no response"
"The fit was lacking , you have to adjust it often to make it lay properly, otherwise it just bunches and looks frumpy. Along the sleeve hem line it looks like it was sewn and then taken apart and re-done leaving behind holes in the shirt. See attached pictures. The band at the bottom is a off color from the shirt and not the same gray as shown in the advertised picture. I did get it for lightening deal of $8.99, but I will still be sending back."
eh not what I expected. didn't realize the material was satiny.
"This ring looks very cheap.  I know it isn't very expensive but, it looks like pure costume jewelry.  I returned it right away."
"Chain is NOT real, so had to buy a different gold chain. Cross is perfect for little kids, but adults would probably want a piece of better quality."
"Not for you if you have a wide foot. The foot bed is extremely narrow at the arch. When I tried a larger size to get a wider foot bed all I got was an inch or more of space above my toe. Basically, sizing up is not going to help the width problem."
"The ""Unisex""sizes are really means sizing. Because the shipping is so high, I just got rid of it."
"For years I wore Nancy Ganz Belly Buster shapers and I loved them. In fact I still have several that are still in wearable condition. So I was very excited when I bought a few of these. Unfortunately, they are nothing like the old Belly Busters. They are flimsy, and they ripped apart at the seams almost immediately. They would be great for skinny girls with no bulges and no cellulite, but with their really light hold, they are totally inappropriate for those of us who are too curvy. I chose an extra large size, which the size I previously wore with Nancy Ganz, The seams just broke all over. The thread used is inappropriate for the stretchy material that it is holding together."
"These are really cute, but they are definitely not leather. There is no leather present on these moccs, even though the ad says they are 100% leather. I'm sending them back."
Color starts fading plus you could smell the copper after wearing it.
I couldn't wear it. The breast area just looked hideous. I threw it and couldn't even put it on once.
Water resistant but NOT water proof. My son's feet were also cold after a short time outside. These boots would benefit from a liner inside and a water repellant spray coating.
I take my review back because it worked for the first trip then i did not use it and it would not work it would turn off when i lift it to weigth my bag very dissapointed
"I'm 5'2', 130 lbs. Medium should have been a good fit with a bit of room...and it was until I washed it. It shrunk to be super tight; showing all of my lovely lady lumps. If you are fit (as in zero body fat), or love to show all of your rolls and such (and if so, you go girl! No body shaming here) then you should get this shirt. If you like to leave a little to the imagination, either order up or go with a different shirt."
"My grandmother says it is too small I tried two sizes 36-38 and she said they were ""way to tight"" or"" a little tight."""
It fit somewhat small.
These are not comfortable for my husband's small feet.  Too big!
This hat is definitely oversized. It belongs in a circus.
"This swimsuit is super cute; I like the pattern, but I was disappointed when I tried it on. The shorts were a perfect fit but the top was larger than expected. The tank top is clearly made for a bustier woman. I have an average body and wear a ""B"" cup. Don't expect the cups to fit unless you're at least a ""D""."
"I kid you not, one leg was longer than the other. They are amazingly soft and feel great though."
The ring does not look like this when you receive it.  The heart stones are not as defined as in the picture.  It actually looks like it came from a 50 cent bubble gum type machine.
"Broke within 1 week of wearing it. I was able to fix it by using super glue to reattach the cords to the clasp, which speaks more to the quality of the super glue than the necklace."
"I'm not buying anything from China anymore that is clothing the size is so ridiculous small. Should have bought my kids some really nice stuff made in the USA. Everything was too tight and short even for my 10yo. I have a ton of cute items that wouldn't fit a single person woman or child I know, even by their sizing charts."
Well smaller than others of same size from other brands. Can't wear them and bought two packages.
"Having a problem with various Netaya Jewerly when a magnet is involved. I tried testing a few of thier products with a magnet and some of thier jewerly sticks to the magnet, some draws close to the magnet, and others do not. I address the issue to Netaya customer service and after a week never heard from them. One necklace that was addressed in this issued (and unfortunately was not fullfilled by Amazon) I had to pay for return shipping even after my request no response from seller. The pendant was very heavy which was my reason to check with a heavy duty magnet. The pendant however is marked 925 so I am not sure if Netaya is aware that thier supplier (From Thailand) is selling them some mixed material that contains more steel than what should be sterling. Again customer service never responded to me."
very small cut very short
"I was very disappointed with the quality of the fabric with this product.  The logo looked good, but the fabric is very rough and if you hold it up to the light it almost has a qauze like quality to it.  I had purchased as an Xmas  gift for someone and since the T-shirt arrived on Dec. 24th, I had no time to get something else.  I was embarrassed when they opened the gift and saw the poor quality.  Don't waste your money.  I wish I hadn't."
"Very cheap product. Way overpriced. The sides are metal however overall they are plastic - and mine came bent and not straight, which can't be tweaked. Nice case and accessories-  I will buy some other pair and use those but these glasses are almost useless. They're more of a men's size, although the bridge of the nose is far too small and slips down your nose."
"This was a Christmas gift for my daughter.  She was delighted when she opened the box.  Her delight was short-lived when she was removing the tag and the chain snapped.  We will replace the chain with something sturdier, as this was far more delicate than most people can manage.  The pendant is lovely though."
Graphic is nice but very cheap feel to it.  Styrofoam covered with a printed sheet.  Dings easily and definitely not durable for the price.
"Ladies, this is very cheap looking in person. I would not even give it to a daughter as the stones are clearly glued on and glued sideways. Terrible product.  DO NOT BUY. CHEAPLY MADE. LOOKS BETTER ON WEB. Note to Amazon, please discontinue this item."
WAY smaller than the size chart says
"This dress feel like paper very cheaply made. The size run large. I am normally an XL and or size 16.. I know all costume run small so I ordered plus size. And, this dress is true to size and a bit too large."
Logo was printed a lot larger than advertised.
"Definitely lighter than I was expecting.

Edit:  After less than 2 months of occasional light wear (for work, no running) these shoes began to fall apart, the soles on this shoe came unglued."
Cup wrinkles at top. Not recommended.
Rolls up and is not useful.  I spend more time pulling it down than I should have to.
"I had to send them back  two sizes smaller than stated, and no good for Casual Friday at work, cheap looking"
Stones fall out easily leaving me with a prong in my nose!
The top is ok. You can't wear panties with the skirt. The material is so thin.
"I loved this till I washed it.  I did as the instructions said and the paint completely washed away.  At first I thought it was inside out, but the paint decal was completely gone.  Such a disappointment."
"Save yourself the money, is my advise. They were a bit tight but the real dissapointments are:
1. No support on the sides. 2. the shoes just feel like mush when you walk. 3. The very back of the heel sort of gives in before the rest of the sole. 4. Seems hard on ankles. 5. Not especially well made. 6. Can't tell that there is any spring action at all.
For people like me, who have trouble with arthritis, knees, hips ankles, leg/back pain, etc. DO NOT BUY this shoe!  I was hoping for some relief but instead they are much worse than the 20 dollars slip ons you can buy at WalMart.
If you don't have physical problem except for tired feet, I would buy a good pair of Nikes rather than these.

Worst $61 dollars I ever spent."
I am returning the dress because it's too small.  I will reorder larger size.  Love the fabric.
CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP it was broken when i received it.
Fits as expected. Material is as expected. Image was as expected initially. Horrible fading after first wash. Save your money on this one. I had washed this shirt for the first time along with 4 other Ironman shirts I had just purchased and this was the only one that had any fading. I can understand a little fading but the image was nearly none sustain after the very first wash. Unacceptable.
"it has some awful ""flap"" sound when you walk. I won't recommend it."
"Mine are standing on the shoe rack. Similar shoes by Fila have wide sizes, so I wear those."
"Following what others have said, I ordered a size larger. I could not even fit my toes into the boot that is how small these run. glad i got them on sale. horrible sizing issues"
"Cheap material, very scratchy. Very slim fit and extra short in the torso, maybe a youth size. Very disappointed in the quality and shape of this shirt. Also shipping took 2 weeks, pretty slow for Amazon."
Worthless not large snuff to stretch women boots and if they did they just collapsed with no resistance
"Was supposed to be silver, and was sent a black buckle and belt; not like the picture. Very deceiving."
"It was nice when I got it.  I used it a few times.  It does not stop the wind very well.

My biggest complaint is the color.  It is just impossible to clean.  It is dirty now and I have been unable to clean it.  I have tried a few different methods.  Maybe it is the fabric or the color."
"These aren't the Clarks I typically enjoy.  They had a plastic, cheap look and fit poor on my feet even though I bough my consistent size.  Sadly, back these shoes goe."
"I really didn't find these to be very comfortable. I have narrow feet, and I found the regular boots with normal socks to be quite stuffy. They were also small. The rounded-top of the foot looked strange to me, but maybe you will be into it for the price. Not my cup of tea, though!"
"The slip fits fine, but it does not stay down on the legs.  I have to pull the slip down regularly or it hovers just at the buttocks."
"These boots aren't ideal for women with thin calves. I was hopeful that the tie in the back would allow me to make the shaft of the boot tighter, and while that worked a little, it wasn't enough to provide a nice fit. I have thin calves, but really just a bit thinner than average- not dramatically so. If it weren't for the fit, I probably would have kept these boots rather than returning. They are cute, though didn't seem comfortable enough for a full day's worth of wear."
"I am disappointed in these. They're extremely stiff, run a size too small, and uncomfortable. I ordered a wide width to get extra toe room but these feel like a medium and at least a size too small. And why is it shaped like this? Human feet aren't curved upwards! Everyone loves these but I don't get it - I got the tan/silver, maybe that makes a difference. I'm back to square one looking for a minimalist, comfortable ballerina flat."
"I am really disappointed with these.  I wore Mizuno Wave Alchemy shoes for the past 9 years and these just suck.  The 11s were not great either, but I have the 4s up through these and they have been getting progressively worse.  I used to use these as a short lean runner with stubby wide flat feet.  Now, they seem to be geared to fat men with crap feet.  They are so heavy, bulky, and cumbersome I don't get how you can call them a control shoe if you're constantly fighting with them.  I'll go home and use some of my several-years-old pairs that have become lawn-mowing shoes for running and even though they're worn out, they're still better than these."
Don't like the elastic inside the belt... and it's fake leather...
Terrible quality! Stretched out immediately and didn't retain shape. Ripped on first wear.
Comfy but be prepared to have your home invaded by little fuzz balls that will go everywhere. These little fuzz balls will end up in places that you will be embarrassed to admit on any online review post.
"I don't like the quality and workmanship. Also, it is for someone with large wrist...with 8' bracelet. My bracelet length is normally 6.5"" -7"" so it is too large."
I love malas but this was not vibrating correctly.  More of a toy.  I am a spiritual advisor and this felt way off.  I own malas and this was way off.
my high instep on my left feet would not fit  it hurt so I decide to had to return them.
"I bought this item as a gift for my sister.  When it came, I was sad to see that it looks much cheaper than I expected.  The area on the 'parents' appears to have a white-ish coloration, almost as if they inlaid another material over it so that the child would contrast with the color.  The packaging is just awful- cheap and thin.  In fact, I had to get another box to put it in before I gave it to her.  My sister still decided to return it in hopes of finding another, nicer family necklace.  I do not suggest buying this product."
"My husband bought these from my wish list. I wish I hadn't put them on there.

They are barely adequate in length.  I am 5'7""  and they barely cover from below knee to ankle without any scrunching at all.  Look at the sales picture...they are shown scrunched which implies extra length.  The person in the photo must be 4 feet tall.
I haven't washed them, yet and if they shrink , they will be useless to me.

I would NOT recommend this for fashion wear at all. The edges are poorly finished."
"these shoes are pieces of crap. returned them. very thin and cheaply made, feels like they're made of plastic. barbie shoes."
"Excellently made, lovely craftsmanship BUT TRULY a close fitting shirt. Was bought for a neat man and was still too snug. If anything go up a size when choosing sizing...."
A. flimsey shoe. compared to same type Easy Spirit I purchased two years ago.  I returned them.  A person without foot problems could wear them.
"Unhappy. Bought these things for foot pain and for that they are pretty good. Wore them for about a week and the Plantar Fa-whatever was on it's way out. Great! So I'd wear them once in a while - maybe once every 2 to 3 weeks ever since. Maybe 25 times in 6 months. Yesterday one of the ""reinforced"" plastic loops that hold the shoelaces rips and with that I have one very expensive unwearable pair of glorified walking shoes.
Yeah, I'm pretty upset. I would not buy another pair of these on a bet. And I won't recommend them either. Not unless they get rid of their lacing system."
Not Fit as expected
Necklace is very pretty but Iam missing the earrings  need earrings  ASAP!
Flawed and broke first time
Pattern is very uneven.
Tight on arms. Way too long.  I waited too long to return
Circle on sole made them slick. Granddaughter fell with them.
"cheap feel, but I guess for the price I shouldn't be so surprised."
I love my OTBT springfields and thought these would be the same fit. Unfortunately they were uncomfortable in the front part of the shoe and I didn't think they would stretch there. The galaxy is a lovely purple though and I wish I could have kept them.
"I do not own this specific watch, but I do own several Seiko kinetic watches.  Not one of them still works.  Seiko leads you to believe you will never need a battery for your watch.  Not true.  They use a rechargeable battery (capacitor) that eventually will no longer retain a charge and need to be replaced, usually within 3 years or so.  This will cost you $75-150 for most kinetic watches, and if you own a kinetic auto-relay watch many jewelers will not work on it.  You will spend far less money buying watches that need regular battery replacement.

After owning 4 Seiko kinetic watches, some of which I paid well over $500 for, I have given up buying any more Seiko kinetic watches.  They are a huge rip-off.  Buyer beware."
These don't stay up the way that you would want them to.  Not really designed for successfully achieving or executing the intended look.
Cheaply made don't buy it
"this shirt is not as good as I expected, I think I'll never buy this kind of shirts anymore. It's not as good as it is in the picture."
"You get what you pay for, folks. These are tiny and cheap. I ended up splurging on the Spanx version and they're worth every penny!"
"Rating explanation - 5 stars for comfort and support.  Negative stars due to the smell - resulting in 2 stars

I purchased these shoes from a local vendor.  They are exceedingly comfortable for both casual and exercise wear. They offer great support, and are the first exercise shoes I've purchased in years that don't leave blisters on my feet.  I took them to work to wear for lunch time walks, and around the same time began to notice a smell that made me think someone had discarded rotten food in the area.  Then I thought one of my co-workers must have developed horrible body odor.  After a week or so, I took a trip wearing the shoes during my flight.  The smell followed, so of course I thought I had developed body odor!  But, after unpacking and leaving the shoes in the hotel closet for a couple days, the closet began to take on the same odor.  I was able to track the smell back to the soles (not the insoles) of these shoes.  The smell is a horrible gassy/chemical smell.  I found the same complaint not only with other NB models, but other manufacturer's shoes.  Other reviews mentioned it might be due to the shoes getting wet, or the adhesive, and/or a certain type of foam used.  In any case, they smell too bad to keep in the house.  So, I keep them on the patio, and put them on only when walking outdoors.  They're too comfortable to toss, or they would be gone.  Unfortunately, it seems as if the smell didn't fully develop until I'd owned the shoes for several weeks.

And no, it's not my feet causing the shoes to smell.  And yes, I actually made my spouse to a sniff test, comparing my old, well-worn sneakers to these.  It's the new shoes."
Blisters. 'nuf said.
These shoes run small in the fact that the size is not the problem it is the death of the shoe. It feels like your feet are comming out of them when you walk due to the side being cut so low you can see under the arch of your feet. This is the best way I can describe them
"I ordered Sakkas 197 Oasis Gauzy Crepe Sleeveless Blouse, color: Eggplant and you sent: Black and purple. I am not very happy as I don't like the blouse. It's too expensive to send it back because I live in Bogot Colombia South America."
I got it on sale thinking that I am getting great deal on Fila jacket but I am returning it right away. I got size medium for my mom and it looks more like medium for kids. There are stitches that are hanging out. I got black and Purple color. Purple color on hoodie is pink not purple. Ugly pink too. It is very thin and flimsy. I don't recommend it.
the 14 is to short in this shoe
I had to return my purchase.
"Wish I can give this dress 0 stars
It's horrible!
Sizing it's so off. I made sure to measure myself but I still was so off"
These began pilling within a day of use.
Beautiful top but runs way to small... Gave to a friend who loves it...
"I had such high hopes for these! The name sounded great - 'flawless high rise skinny' says all the right things to a thirtysomething mom of 4 who still wants to look cute for her husband - but in reality what I got were unflattering mom jeans.
I like a higher rise in a jean so I don't get the dreaded muffin top, but these were way too high on me. And they just didn't look right at all. Had to return them."
"Ill sum this up for you guys in one following sentence.

Wear socks with it or your feet will have a bad day!"
"The product I received was much smaller than the picture above. I was very disappointed  that I couldn't use this ring for a gift I had
planned to give. I feel that the picture was very misleading and there ought to be a better way to present the actual product."
"The fit for these pants is pretty horrible. The waist is too big and the thigh area is too small. I can't keep anything in my pockets, and my pants are constantly riding down with every movement."
Dress that arrived is pretty but looks nothing at all like the picture.
"This dress made of nice thick fabric. I ordered this dress but it was too, was hoping to just replace it with a bigger size but the only option I got from the seller was to get a refund and that's disappointing."
"Product did come as pictured. NO pipe, NO feather. Very disappointing."
This isn't what I expected. The color is off and this cardigan is very narrow on the sides.
At first this belt seemed to be a good purchase but as time has gone on it has become less so. The problem is that the buckle is designed contrary to physics. As the belt is pulled on the buckle becomes looser and looser rather than tighter and tighter. This problem is amplified as time goes on and the thickness of the belt is compressed. Were the tad on the other side of the belt there would be no issue but as it is I would not recommend it as eventually everyone who actually wears it will have it fail.
"These pants are terrible. im 5'10 almost 5'11 and ive never had a problem with pants till now. I ordered a M regular and i look like a worlds biggest loser contestant trying his old pants on. Im 175lbs athletic build and have a 30 waist. I had to order a M because of fact that their S is to small on me.  But its wayyy too much. Its extremely baggy on the pants sides. Its not tapered in the slightest. They look decent with knee pads on but without, they look gross."
"Painted on the metal. I never wear it. It's very heavy too. I probably wouldn't recommend it if you get migraines in the back of your neck because it's a little heavy. To me, since it's painted, it looks inexpensive."
"Very narrow and stiff. I ordered half a size larger than I usually would in case they were narrow, but they were still way too narrow."
I've had these shoes just over 6 months and the sole is already worn and split.  I've never had a pair of dress shoes last so little of time.  I switched to these for a more classy look but I'll be going back to my old brand.  They at least lasted me over a year.
These run big and are not an attractive fit for my foot.
No I do not recomend&eacute;. Ir saya 6 to 12 and I am 10 and I can not use becarse so strech is bad. I would like to try cotton
At first i thought they were great then i washed them and the cheapness of the product comes out. I bought the same type shorts at khols and i wash them regularly no problem. These after the first wash forget it there done they just got little balls of fabric yarn all over cheap not worth buying.
"I haven't worn them, I don't like the color.
I'd like to send them back.
I need a return invoice.
Please help.
best.
Terry"
"I'll start by saying the fit is nice and it sure is lightweight. I have no idea where the other reviewers live, but this coat is NOT suitable for a Midwestern or northeastern winter. I was a bit dubious as soon as I opened the package. It's lightweight alright. Feels like a thick windbreaker. I wore it outside at 20F (normal winter here) and could feel the cold seeping in immediately and I could especially feel in coming in through the stitching. It's not a complete down fill. Tag says 60% polyester and 40% down, and that the 40% is only 90%, meaning it's 35% down fill. I took a picture of the tag and will try to upload it. Another tag states something along the lines of ""good to two degrees WITH moderate activity"". Another line says it would be warmer if you layered something underneath. (Duh...)
For this price point, I don't expect to have to provide extra layers or jog to stay warm.
Return!"
"Don't waste your money,  the material is so damn thin you might as well just go naked! It's cheap made and you'll look cheap in it!"
So dumb. One more meaningless trinket that will add in the dumbing down of our society. Sad. :(
Couldn't even put it on.
TOO small! The 9 was way smaller than the 8.5 that I was wearing when they were delivered. They are so tight!
I received this as a Christmas gift from my daughter. It is smaller than the pictures and arrived broken in 3 places. It's ugly and looks very cheap. Based on the other reviews mine was the defective one. Can't send it back it'll cost more than it's worth . I gave one star only so I can relate how ugly and disappointed I am. It was tiny like something u would give a 6 year old . My daughter fixed where it was broken but I will never wear it and am too embrassed to give it to someone else.
"The first set of rings I got both were so hard to open and once in my nose impossible to get shut. Contacted the seller and they sent me one more ring after I told them the issue thinking it may have just been the one set I got. Nope. The second ring I got in and got to clip shut, then when I went to take it out I had to use a pliers to get out and it broke in the process!

The ring is cute and I loved the size, but it is just not something I would ever buy again due to it being so difficult to put in and out."
way to small  get 2 sizes bigger
There is a metal rivet in the strap that hurts my ankle. The little patch of material sewn over it also has sharp edges and the design is altogether poor. Also my ankles turned in when I tried these on.
"I like the fit and feel of this bra. Unfortunately there seems to be plastic thread to sew the seems that scratches my skin, making this impossible to wear. Its unbelievably itchy."
My husband has worn these pants since I met him in 1991. These pants are much smaller than the pants we have purchased in the past. I'm not sure if I'll have to get one or two sizes larger in the waist. The other's started off loose and tightened up a bit as they were laundered. These are so tight I'm afraid to wash them. He can barely get them buttoned. I will need to exchange them for a larger size.
Too small. Cheap material.
"I am wearing today for the first time and they are wonderful.  Keep in mind... if you are of a ""larger"" package size, these might not be good for you... but they are good for me!

4/16/13 Update:  Wore them for the 2nd time today and they ripped at the seam.  Terrible product.  Will not buy again.  Positive note was seller was very good!"
Wore one pair and sent them right back.  They tarnished within a few hours
Hand wash only. Not advertised. We will donate to charity as the socks are very thin and hand washing does not fit into a busy bachelor life.
I have quite a few beanies but this one is the loosest fitting of them all but I will keep it and wear it on top of another one just because it's not worth the hassle of sending it back. It's also not as thick as it looks in the picture. A cheep one I picked up off the shelf in some hardware store is thicker and warmer.
"The material feels really cheap.  Reminds me of a cheap plastic table cloth.  Although my daughter hasn't worn it, I fear that itll be torn in no time.  The design is pretty, just wish the material was more durable."
"I've had Merrell Moab Ventilator hiking shoes before this pair, and they were all very comfortable. Merrell has changed the way these shoes fit-- they've increased the arch support too much and also made the width of the shoe in the arch area more narrow. The result is that these are extremely uncomfortable to wear for more than an hour. I thought maybe I got a unique pair so went to a shoe store and tried on the same size/width Moab Ventilator's there and found that that pair had same issues-- over aggressive arch support and narrower in the arch area. The other thing is that Merrell also changed the insole material-- the old material was very soft and almost like a velour-- made the old pairs feel almost like very comfortable slippers. Their new insoles are orange and made from a more ""burlap"" like material-- not soft at all and kind of rough. I'm not sure why Merrell made all these changes but I am extremely disappointed and won't be buying any Merrill Moab Ventilators again. Merrell's Moab Ventilators used to be the most comfortable hiking shoe but now they're terrible with a very aggressive arch area and very rough insole material. I even tried changing the insole on this new pair to something else with less of an arch-- only to find that the aggressive arch in these shoes are BUILT INTO the base of the shoe-- so no way to reduce the irritating aggressive arch in these shoes!!! So a total waste of my money for these shoes. Goodbye Merrell!! Instead will try to find a nice softer fit from other hiking shoe manufacturers such as Columbia."
"Beautiful watch, but had to return. I have a thin wrist and it wouldn't even fit me. I only buy Bulova watches; very disappointing."
extra large KID sized...
ORDERED MEN'S.  CAME IN AS WOMEN'S. SO NOW SINCE THEY WERE SMALL AND WOMEN'S WILL HAVE TO WEAR AND RE-ORDER FROM ANOTHER SUPPLIER THE MEN'S THAT WAS INITIALLY ORDERED.
"Too big, cheap fabric,  sent it back"
"You get what you pay for here and maybe not even.
Pro: The boots look as the displayed image.
Cons:
they don't stay up past the knee and start going down immediately after you start walking in them.
I've had them for a little over a month and already have to throw them out bc they are breaking open in the back of the heel area.

SO in short, I would recommend not even wasting your money and saving up for something of better quality which is what I'll do next time."
This watch is mainly for fashion. It's attractive and fashionable. But if you are an active person. Please don't buy it. Its incredibly fragile watch. It literally cannot hold its breath under water. Big let down. The only plus about this watch was the band for which I use with another watch.
This dress is really short.  I'm 5'5.  135lbs.  Ordered the medium.  Guess it's my fault for not reading the description well enough.  Can wear as a tunic or beach cover up.
"I was looking for a lightweight sleep shirt for travel, one that would dry quickly after hand laundering. Maybe I read the reviews incorrectly, but this is not a light fabric, though it is very soft and feels like good quality. Also the shape is very boxy."
"Well, got this due to add-on pricing. Product seems well made but before I could have my son wear it, I had to wash it first. Lo and behold, 4 different small holes appeared near the buttons and lower hem (all in the front). The shirt will end up as a ""house clothes"" and not for school wearing. I paid $7.59, not worth it."
snug and sheer!
"I bought this for my wife as a gift. After 2 weeks of regular wear, the 'rose' finish had already begun to come off the watch band, revealing a dull gray color beneath. I contacted the seller but they were useless so I am just going to return the watch.

BEFORE it started rubbing off, it looked wonderful. I just think it's messed up that a Fossil watch looks like it has aged 2+ years in 2 weeks."
This shoe would be comfortable but the heal is so big it flops off my foot. Terrible.
Cheaply made-no room!  Very unhappy!!  I would never buy again
"I return it, when loaded the folding flap made it to thick.  Otherwise it was not for me and felt like imitation material.  I was not going to write a review but the seller sent a letter requesting it."
"The color's okay, but the shirt isn't nearly as long as pictured. It portrays going past your natural waist AND hips, but mine barely skimmed the waist of my mid-rise jeans."
"I bought this pair of clogs because I heard so many positive reviews of Crocs. But as it turned out, it was ordinary and certainly not worth the amount of money you are seeing on this page. It was as comfortable as any cheap made-in-china slippers. I wore it bare-footed and at the end of the day, I got some nasty blisters. With socks, the comfort level did not improve much. Not to mention the fashion sense. It looked ugly enough, even without socks. I had been prepared to do a trade-off between comfort and fashion. But it is a no-brainer now. I'll just dump this pair of shoes."
"Was excited to get this watch after reading good reviews of it on watchuseek.com/forum but after opening it up, noticed that hey... the seconds hand is bent.  Noticeably bent... Not lifted upward, but bent in the middle, with the tip forward going clockwise.  Next, the inner circle with the hours markers didn't match up with the outer indexes.  For example, the 4-hour marker should line up with the 20 minute marker, but it was slightly off.  Finally, the hour hand, when lining up with the inner hour markers, at the hour, the minute hand was off by a few minutes.  Depending on what hour it was, the minutes hand would be between 2-6 minutes ahead.  I had read great things about Orient watches, hopefully this Flight line is just an exception.  Returned it and ordered a higher quality Steinhart instead."
"the size for my foot seemed small; but, the boot itself seemed big and clunky. the height also seemed a bit low - like it would let snow get in. felt like boot would keep you warm and dry but I returned without using for the other two reasons. got the Keen Burlingtons and am extremely happy."
I have bought these in the past and they were perfect. Now the inseam is too long. I found another brand that has a short inseam that I like.
Del apart
Cheap material. Its not the same color as in the picture. It's really white! The material is rough and itchy. Would not buy again.
Wrong watch.. I ask this watch and you send me another...
Falls out all the time...
"I do not normally write bad reviews for a product unless it is really disappointing. Well, this product was more than disappointing. I only wear these shoes indoors and after a week, it ripped and the sole fell apart ! The ""fur"" inside the shoe is all flattened out now. No cushion, and the material is very thin. I felt like the photo is somewhat deceiving when I received the actual product. Save your money and get a higher quality product."
Wore just 1 day and got a hole in the crotch area where the stitching is. Not going to buy again and I recommend not to by this product.
"0- 6 months is supposed to cover a baby that is about 5 to 20 lbs, which basically tells you how bad this will fit.  Made for a baby that is closer to 6 months. It is very wide and the tulle is sewn on flat, which doesn't make it look as cute as the photo.  I was actually hoping the writing was painted dots and not actually rhinestones (like I saw one reviewer say), but mine was rhinestones.  They seem fairly secure, but it's still questionable with how cheap the rest of the product looks."
Does not fit.  Extremely small.  Runs very small.
"tight and sheer, not what I expected at all"
"I bought these shoes after wanting them for months, they looked so fresh and sporty. I tried them on at the store and they fit great but when I wore them for a day they killed my feet and are extremely narrow. I don't have a wide foot but these are too tight at the bottom of the lace part and there is no way to widen them. I wanted to tough it out and break these in but my feet cant handle the pain on my big toe. I would recommend the Nike Free instead of the Flex if you have a wide foot."
"There is a lot of variety to be sure...

But out of the 110 pieces there were only 37, 14 gauges.

And out of that 37 I can only use 18 of them as the spike things are obnoxious and I don't have my belly button pierced.

I have my nipples and ears done. Both are 14g.
I only wear on ball on the front of my ears. As for the nipple having variation is pretty fun.

Just be aware 14 gauge people, that there is this risk."
I don't know what is up with these boots but they are not at all waterproof.  Are they fake bogs?  I have an email out with the company to try and find out.  Soaking wet feet and they are impossible to dry quickly due to the material in the boot lining.  Buy oakiwear boots instead!
"the Lens holders, screw and the entire attachment is made of chrome colored plastic.  I was embarrassed to give them as a gift, as they are very cheap on the magnifying attachments,  fine, the lens are plastic, but the adjustable parts need to be metal.  I just don't understand why the sellers cannot be upfront and say what each part is made off, google synthetic  rubber, strap elastic fabric,lens plastic and lens holders plastic. Because when you leave out info, your lying. Do not buy these."
Color was baby poop yellowish orange. Calf was much wider than I expected. Returned immediately.
Way too big even for an oversized garment.
"Great-looking hat, but enormous.  Gigantic, actually.  Suspect manufacturer has no concept of the size of American heads!  Only way I could wear it would be too tuff it with tissue or babies, and those  are not options.
A shame,  because it is a stunning hat and just what I wanted,"
Sorry but these are made ONLY for young women with perfect breasts (or implants) that are not too big. I ordered the medium as they said that would work for a 36 B/C. This is slightly small and offers almost NO support so it looks almost like I'm not wearing a bra. I was trying to get away from uncomfortable underwire bras but this one is not the answer.
Thin..  cheap.
The strings do not stay tied on my foot at all
"I wanted this to work so badly, but the material looks cheap, the lace is an ugly yellow/green, and the stitching doesn't line up at all- it's completely uneven in the front. So disappointed! Trashed!"
"Even thought I ordered a 10W I found these sandals way too narrow in the heel.  They were most uncomfortable.  :-(  Too bad, because the design  was very nice."
"I love my Asics shoes. I've worn them for the last 15 years .  I am a nurse and have tried many different shoes but still come back to asics, however these particular shoes are not wide enough even though they say wide. The length fits as stated. It is difficult for me to rate the comfort of the shoe because the width makes the shoe too uncomfortable to wear."
It cuts into my upper chest/arm area and is not comfortable.
I purchased two of these shirts and I only wear them around the house as the neck line hangs very low and shows more skin than I care to display in public.
Too flimsy.  Shows every flaw.
"This was so paper thin and flimsy I couldn't get it to stay straight underneath the sweater I wanted to wear over it.  It reminded me of a thin hankerchief with a collar; there was no body to the fabric.  I threw it in the trash, what a waste!"
Really disappointed. This was made for petite people. XL was definitely a medium but the torso was short and so were the sleeves. Normally I would order mediums because I'm 5'2 and 154 pounds.  Had to give this to my little sister who is short.
I don't understand how anyone can give a five star rating on this ring. First the size is 6m7m? When I opened the box and saw the ring I was sick. It looks like it's for a fourteen year old girl. The pearl is so small that I couldn't give it to my wife on mother's day. I don't know about 6m or 7m. All I know is in the advertisement the pearl looked big a decent size. They should place a cup or something that you can compare with. All I know is it's going back. It was a deceitful advertisement. I can't believe people are very happy with such a tiny pearl. On less as I said earlier you bought it for a young teenage girl.
"Eventhough they are wolverine boots, they are pretty uncomfortable. I would recommend getting soul inserts. You get what you pay for.....that being said, they are still nice boots for the price."
"Shoe was size narrow; my foot is medium width, shoe was returned."
I couldn't get my arms in the sleeves.  Torso of the dress was almost too big.  Very disappointed.  Could I report it as both too small and too large?  Returned.
I was so DISSAPOINTED when i recieved these shoes!! First i opened the box and looked at the shoes and i couldn't believe what they looked like!! They were the wrong color i ordered the pink multi and got multi shoes but they were greenish multi very ugly!!! And i tryed them on anyway and my right foot didn't fit the shoe the correct way they were bend all out of shape and the left foot was the same way all bend out of shape. It appeared to me that the shoes was worn several times. Each shoe was shaped different both of them a terrible fit. There was nothing right about these shoes. I always order my shoes from Amazon and never had shoes to look and fit the way they did. Another words they looked used over and over and one shoe was bigger then the other. I will never order from this company again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You would think for $42.00 pair of shoes they would be nice at least. I gave a one star because there was nothing right about these shoes nothing like the picture and two shoes the wrong fit Meaning each shoe was all out of shape. Im writing this review because i care about people and want you to know and hope no one gets shoes like i did or get something you didn't order!! I am a size 10 and both shoes fit totally different!!!! NOT TRUE TO SOZE FOR ME AT LEAST.I JUST THINK FOR WHAT I SPEND I WOULD OF GOTTON A GOOD PAIR OF SHOES!! I DO NOT RECOMMAND!!
Too tight through my legs.  Returned
"I am not a fan of these socks. They are tight at the top, near the knee, but then they still fall down. The colors are also not as bright as pictured."
was disappointed that they were a full size too small....they were marked the correct size but didn't fit.  Bought my first pair two months ago at Nordstrom size 11.5 and they fit perfectly so 11.5 is my correct size.
"I am really sorry to say, this pendant is so super small! if you like really dainty than go for it. The blue is pretty and clear. the chain is super cheap also. I had higher expectations for there products I am sending them all back and I ordered a lot! Just cheaply made however very pretty blue which is what drew my attention to this jewelry."
Returned it because the colors were faded and not vibrant as posted
Flimsy and broke after a couple of wears
"Packaged arrived a week after it was supposed to. It was supposed to be prime shipping and it wasnt. I will NEVER purchase from this seller again.

It was too small. I ordered a 4X. I am 5'5 and 200 pounds. Size D bra. The cup size was too small. The torso was too short to it either rode low up top or it rode too high on the bottom. Thin fabric."
Ok Im changing my rating. The material is flimsy and they keep falling off.
These run insanely large.
"This is a cute swimsuit and if it had fit better I would have kept it, but...the top is irregular.  I ordered a size up per the description, so I ordered a large, normally I would have ordered a Medium.  I am a 34c, size small/medium shirt and size 6/7 bottom in regular clothes.  And this top is closer to a 38 band with a/b cups.  It does not fit well at all, I am returning it.  I wish it fit better.  I did not even try on the bottoms because the top did not fit.

I received this at a discount for my honest opinion."
"i recieved it with the right lens scratched  and broken. it was a good size, good color but man i paid for a broken, scratched product"
"This item looks nothing like the picture. It's a short poncho, definitely to short to cover a bathing suit"
One side is much longer! Seriously?
This fabric felt awful.
"not as pictured, very cheap looking.  I am only keeping to use as snow boots"
Again another bad buy. If you are making of an international market than your sizes should be to international standards or size not Asian.
This umbrella was very difficult to open and then just as difficult to fold back down. It feels as if after a few openings and closings it will break because of having to forse it to open.  I will not close down to the original size therefore it is a strain to wrap the band around it when it is in the folded closed position.  It will not fit back into its case. Construction not much better than a $3.00 umbrella you can buy on any corner on a rainy day.  It is pretty but not worth it.
the crinkles are a little too much
these shoes come up high in the back and have rubbed a blister on my feet multiple times.  I have tried the old bandaid trick and stretching them.  I would not buy again.
"Very small, a phone cannot  fit in there."
Button fell off on day 2.
"This travel pro does not include the attachment for a tote.  :(((
Does not balance properly with a 2nd tote bag/brief."
I purchased this for a European trip.  I wore it several times.  It proved to be hot to wear and not very functional.  I went back to using my wallet.
Didn't realize they were made of felt.  Too cheapy for what I wanted.  Appropriately priced for what I got though.
Isn't true sterling silver
Clips were plastic and did not work. The cheap clips are also installed backwards. After about 5 minutes I had only one clip working so I tossed it out. JUNK !
Waaaaaay too tight.
The length of this pullover is no where near the length on the model. It looks almost like a halter top. Everything else is accurate as far a the pic (color and length of sleeves). Other than that please be aware of the sizes and know that they are not based on a US scale
"Beautiful product, so long as you never wash it! It's shrinks, even though it claims to be preshrunk. I attempted to return it and the seller refused to take it back because it was washed. I will never buy from them again."
Rips
DON T LIKE
"Right out of the attractive box the watch's sweep hand stuck around the 25 min mark.  I might have to replace the battery, but certainly have to replace two links on the band.  Why should i have to contend with that.  Why was this watch marked 8932A. Was it because the sweep hand would stick at the 25 min mark? I don't know. I'm sending it back."
Much smaller than expected. The fit at the end of the leg is wider than expected. Pictured it looks to fit the leg tightly but once on the bottom was oddly loose.
Looks better in the picture than in real life. Not one of my favorites. Looks very cheap.
"too small,,,,,,,, gave to my daughter,,,,  pants should not cost 118.00,"
"Child sized product. Flimsy, easy to knot. It's a string and a charm. I returned it for a real bracelet."
This dress is so cheap looking. It ripped the first day I even tried it on. I'd be better off wearing my tablecloth.
"The band that has the hooks is extremely rough and has been driving me crazy.  Also, I normally take a 36 and this 36 felt very snug.  I would not recommend this bra to others."
"I should have known better than to purchase undies on Amazon.  I'm tiny and these things were super small, uncomfortable and the lacey part is the front is borderline painful.  Waste of money."
I don't really like it. It is hard and the brim is pooly finishec. It loiks and feels cheep.
Very little support!
"These aren't what I ordered.  I ordered the ones with the different colored trim and that is not what I received.  The ones I received also have random words printed big on the front.  My daughter doesn't need brave underwear.  Plain would've been fine, but I'll suck it up this time.  Would not recommend."
Gaudy and too over the top....even if they fit I wouldn't have kept these. They're going back
I by no means have wide feet.  I'd say I've got the most normal perfect sized 8.5 feet there is and these shoes were awful for my feet.  The seams that gather up the toe box pinched horribly on the joint of my big toe where it connects to ball of my foot.  These are virtually unwearable which is too bag since these shoes are adorable.  Buyer beware unless you have VERY narrow feet.
"The shoe is ok, but it really isn't all that comfortable and it wears a lot longer than I had anticipated.  I have lots of room for my toes . . . too much!  I guess that's just a sizing error so be cautioned that they run long."
They are so ugly and huge! Don't look like they do in picture at all! Do NOT waste your money unless ur looking for huge earrings!!
"I was unimpressed with this sweater when it arrived. I wanted it to use at my semi-casual workplace that blasts the air too much for my comfort. For reference, I usually wear size 4 and am 5'11"". I don't mind a loose fit, but in this circumstance I found to mean terribly unflattering. When they say grandad sweater, they really mean designed for a mans body I guess, as the shoulders were set way too wide, and I consider myself to have broad shoulders. I found it, with the way it fit, looking to cheap and junky for my workplace. It's also not very thick or warm at all. I may try altering it as shipping doesn't seem worth it for a sweater at this price. So to sum it up: Not for those who are thin, or tall, or get very cold!"
Too small and not the fabric image. Expected 100% polyester
This was much gaudier in person decided to return.
The straps at your heel are defective and are too long. I didn't expect a lot but these were un-wearable.
"Seams are crooked, not the hues I have previously purchased from department stores"
This was a waste of money.. it's been one time I have used it so far and the pin bent on my tie.  I had to try a re straighten it.  A few days after the main stone gem on the head of the product falls out..  this is my worse purchase off amazon.  Completely disappointed.
Returned it as it was way too big
The same goes for these as the one's posted above. I'll be looking for a new brand when these wear out.
I work construction so I wear heavy duty boots for about 12 hours a day and with that being said I need heavy duty laces. I bought these because my nylon strings break about every month or two so I ran across these on Amazon and they say they will never break so of course that got my attention and I bought 2 pair at $20 a pair. I have to say lacing them up for the first time felt great because I was able to pull them super tight and it felt great for the first month or two but then one day I was lacing them up and the black sheath came off about 18 inches of it so now I had black and white shoe laces that I couldn't keep tied which was aggravating. I took the other ones I bought and after a month or two the same thing happened . Long story short is they will break and they will burn and you most definitely can cut them. Overpriced laces.
Im giving this 2 stars only because we ordered a 2xlt (my husbands normal Carhartt size) and it was wayy too short. The size was all off even though it said it was a 2xlt. The company way great about returning it.. not their fault.
These were low quality socks. I was buying anti slip socks for my mother. These did not have enough rubber on the bottom to prevent slipping. Yes they verse very soft and pretty but if your looking to prevent falls these are not the ones.
"I bought these socks for my four year old son, but they are too hard for him to put on. He can put on other types of socks; just not these because the cuff around the ankle is too snug. They have to be squashed up like stockings to get them on or they are sort of like one of those Chinese finger traps. Very disappointing -- the more things they can put on by themselves, the happier everyone is."
"Its a bit too tight for my liking, even when I ordered a little bigger.
Its more comfortable than some of my other high support bras, but i need help getting it on/off sometimes - there is NO give to the fabric."
Too bulky.  Too heavy.  Cannot return.
"Looks nice, but too small. Returned."
This shoe fits well but is constructed with a hard & unforgiving canvas material. Hurts after wearing for more than a couple of hours. Super cute but not very comfortable.
"I was very skeptic about getting this product...but after reading the ""wonderful"" reviews I decided to get it....what a huge mistake!!!!  I'm a C/D cup... and it didn't hold them... too bad, if anyone knows of a product like this one that ACTUALLY works, let me know!

I just read the 5 stars ratings again, and yes, most of them are FAKE.  Pay attention when reading 5 stars reviews, ALWAYS.  I should have done it before buying this horrible product.  I'm sure it might work for A-cups, but definitely not for C, D and on...."
"Love the shoe, but it was too narrow...may need to order a wider width"
DO NOT BUY! The boots don't last and fall apart.
It break
I wear 34X34 so I purchased a size larger based on reviews and they were way too large/long. Sent back for 34X32.
"not as pictured, took too long to arrive, way to long in fact.  Material & fit are cheap"
"the relog arrived safely, packing just, well, the color is beautiful, excellent price, very cheap, bring a spare battery, looks very strong, nice. bad relog, relog color fades, bleach is very fast and ugly color, cheap but bad."
seems were irritating and bothersome... Had to return them
Was disappointed with the fit of this dress. The top was too big and the middle was too small. I have a large chest so this was really weird. Would not recommend unless you are a stick.
"Cute design, but hat is so small it can only fit in a child's head"
"Extremely cheap materials, not like the picture at all . Never wear it because it does not look good at all"
"Its very very big , huge , it reminds me of sunglasses you buy at a party store , Very cheap looking , and made ."
"These were not curvy enough in the hips like most Joe's jeans. I'm 5'6"", 140lbs with a curvy pear shape in my hips and these were too narrow for me. Though I love Joe's jeans and own many pairs, I found this style to be unflattering for me. If you have straighter hips and a narrow frame, these will probably work for you."
That shoes was very big and is for Mens I made that order shoes for womans.....not for mens.
"It was a rough year for finding slippers that I like in the store and I tried a different brand of slippers online from Amazon that I knew wouldn't work the minute I tried them on as the sole was extremely narrow so I returned them and ordered these right away.  These Colorado Chenille slippers were so cushiony and comfy when I first got them but then the cushion started to breakdown.  The inner heel has totally broken down in less than a month. I am disappointed as I was excited about them when I first got them and had to change my review. They should make these ""Colorado Clothing"" slippers in the US and use a better quality cushion so they last! I'm back to wearing my old Isotoners from over 3 years ago again and will be looking for slippers once again. Ugh!  Good news is that I bought the CC slippers from Amazon with Prime and will not have to pay to return them and will receive a refund once they receive the slippers."
XL - fits a size M in juniors. Well constructed just sizing and dimensions listed were completely off!
"small fit and a little too bright. Doesn't really look ""worn in"" because the shirt is such a bright blue. And it contrasts then with the ""worn in"" logo."
"The band fit alright, but the cups were way too huge for 34DD, running up to my armpits. The also were weirdly loose, providing no shape/support.
I returned it."
"not what i expected at all, i don't recommmend waisting anytime buying this produst, unless u are looking for granny panties"
THE TOP WAS TO STIFF
"Great shirt, sent me wrong color. There was 2 labels on the package, the bottom label said black and top label said dark brown. I ordered dark brown."
"Started to tear in hole area, skin will pust through the holes and be very uncomfortable, I use small in all other brands this one is an extra extra small"
"Sadly, I had to send them back even though I absolutely loved the leather faux snake look of them and the kitten heel.  They were too short.  Order 1/2 size larger.  Beautiful shoes, though.  Simple elegance."
Me enviaron un color que no ped
Crap. Doesn't fit
"It was far too big. It looked like I just up on a trash bag. I'm sure it would look cute on some people but it wasn't flattering to my figure at all. I'm 5'3 and curvy, normally wear size 14."
"these overboots seem like they are well made but lightweight. they are a little pricey. they're just the thing for a wet day at work.

UPDATE!!! i bought these boots in late spring and haven't used them due to a dry summer. they have sit on my covered front porch for six months. i got them out this morning after a rainy night and put them on over my shoes. they have dry rotted and had holes and cracks in them. turns out that they are JUNK."
These were too narrow and I had to return them.
"The boots may have been ok and gotten 3* because they are nice looking boots . However, they run really small and narrow. If you have semi wide or wide feet do not bother with these. I have the top of the foot that's high but I haven't had issues with buying Minnetonka moccasins boots but these absolutely did not work. I usually get a 10 when I order boots because I like to wear socks when I wear boots I'm a 9.5. I tried them with knee high nylons and I couldn't even close the zipper. And no they are not wide calf either. I tried to contact the seller and did not receive a call back which another reason why they get 1*.

Amazon gets 5* though because they responded quickly and refunded me quickly."
couldn't get past my hips. if it was 3 in' wider at the waist it would have fit
This was shorter than expected and quite thin. So it wasn't suitable. There are gowns with better fabric that are a better price.
"MARK I LOVE THESE SHOES ROCKPORT, USUALLY BUY THIS BRAND AND ALMOST ALL SHOES ARE ROCKPORT; COMFORTABLE AND JUST TO MEASURE; Unfortunately FAILED ME FIRST, VI SOME COLOR TAN AND PEDI, GOT SOME 3 WEEKS AGO AND TIME OF OPENING THE BOX GAVE ME A SURPRISE, ARE COLOR WINE; I ALREADY HAD A FEW ROCKPORT MAND BRING COLOR THAT CAME AND THIS TIME HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT APPLIED, SEE SEVERAL TIMES IN COLOR ARE MORE PHOTOS AND CAFES ARE THOSE WHO CAME COLOR ME RED WINE, I do not like; I WANTED TO BE ME THE RESET BUT AS THEY SAY THE MIND TO MY COUNTRY AND OUT OF WARRANTY SO ACAV LOST ALMOST $ 60 AND NO I THINK JUST BECAUSE I AM CONSTANTLY CUSTOMER AND ALL I HAVE THE MIND THROUGH AMAZON AND THIS TIME ME OFFICER ASKED FOR SOMETHING THAT NO; ALSO ADJUST THE UPPER IS ME AND ME HURT DEMACIADO, FOR THAT REASON NOT SATISFIED FOR ANY BETTER ME ME FULL DESCEPCIONARON.
BUY THESE DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE"
"Ripoff price, they decieve you with the msrp.  You can find this watch elsewhere for 80 bucks.  The watch is nice enough, dials are as mentioned hard to read as there is no magnification but not a big deal, just don't strqin to see it.  Also I don't think the date thing is very accurate, I think its just got a ring of 31 so its right about half the time, then 6 months out of the year you have to manually correct it."
"Awesome looking shoe,great comfort but didn't even last 30 days of just general use. Sole started peeling away from the shoe!"
This holds a lot and look decent ... but the base will not stay on straight no matter how many times or ways  try to screw it in.  I think there are probably better made units out there.
The watch didn't work. I think the battery is bad. I won't buy anything else to this seller. It is awful to buy something new and it didn't work.
"I'm 5'5"" and 115. The small was too small. Even the medium, tried on over a fairly lightweight ght hoodie, didn't leave much room. And wow--so thin!  I can't see how this could do a whit to keep me warm. Returning."
I wanted something soft and cushy to wear around the house. The thong between the toes is so short and tight that it almost severs my foot. Horrible. Very disappointed. Size-wize they fit perfectly but they are unwearable because of the thong..
"These shoes have an ""old dude"" feel to them and would look great on someone maybe 50+. They seem to be constructed for that age group (or those with podiatric issues) as well.

They run wide and have the widest, tallest toe box I have ever seen. When laced up tight on an average/narrow foot, the fabric at the toe puffs up and looks awful.

Generally not impressed at all."
rusts super quickly
The post is not long enough to put the backing on and it doesn't look like the pictue
fit is off.
Wish I could return these. Can't find the receipt. Not a good supporting shoe. Foot slides from side to side so you find yourself walking on the side of your foot.
Way to small.  Waste of money!
returned due to arm sleeved being baggy but short
"Can we say super-duper SMALL?!  I can get it on, but to wear this underneath something else that may be form fitting would be insane as it does not add a flattering appeal nor does it truly ""slim"" or ""shape"".  Money waisted in my opinion."
"Small and not very stretchy at all. I wear between small(womens) and medium(juniors) and it's way too tight. I can bearly get it over my 36"" bust. Best if you're a slim person. Also it is very see through.  You will NEED an extra layer. Otherwise cute."
"Terrble, 1 week and the faux leather is broken.
Cheap."
"Too small, over priced!"
"Usually very happy with Minnetonka products but this one, not so much.
Initially the fit was good with plenty of  cushioning but within a week that wore down.
And as that happened, the leather did what leather always does (expanded slightly with use) so now my feet flop in the shoes as I move around the house. As stealthy as a spy with hiccups.
As comfortable as a porcupine on an inflatable chair.
You get the idea."
More for looks than to keep warm. The cap already snagged. The knitting is very open. Cold wind blows and I can feel the cold air blasting to my head. The scarf is okay since I can wrap around twice to keep cold air out.
"Unfortunately I would not buy this again.  It's not 100% cotton (my fault for not reading the description) but the worst part is that it's too tight in the shoulder area to be comfy while you're lounging at home.  Placket area can be unbuttoned pretty far down which is nice if you want to show some cleave.  But due to the fit, I fear it's just going to sit in the closet now."
"The first dress I purchased was size small in Black-Red and it fit perfectly. I get a ton of compliments and LOVE it, so purchased another one in small in floral green. The floral green one is HUGE, rendering it completely unwearable. The tag says small, but it fits like a large. I'm very disappointed."
"The bottoms fit great but the top was poorly made. The top fit but gave me underboob because there is not elastic band in the bottom of the top piece.

Sad because I love the look of this swimsuit, going to return it."
Hard to pack. Collapses
"They are way too big and come up way too high on my foot...so they look a bit grandma...  For the product, I could have spent half the price at target and they would have fit better."
The fit was perfect the length was just right but the material was way too thin could see right through them will not be able to wear even just to lounge could see through even the double material waistband! just too sheer.
"Look, I only have 38 D breasts and I was popping out of this top with every movement. What a pity, because the fabric was silky,it's that crinkly type of rayon or some synthetic. The dress was long enough, maybe a little too long. But from the waist up, it was claustrophobic."
"It's true! It's true!, Like the glow of embers in the fireplace it is very pretty to look at; but unlike the cozy fireplace this dress will not give you any warmth. The material is so thin and clingy; It did nothing for my  figure. Just by adding jeweling does not make a gauze a dress."
"I wouldn't buy this again, I didn't return it just to avoid the hassle. It's cute, but the length on the arms is short. I ordered a medium (I usually wear a small, but as this would be layered I went up a size) I'm sure the small wouldn't have worked. It's pretty cheaply made as well. Also, the drawstrings aren't in good shape."
love the style but they are so narrow even after putting shoe stretchers they are still uncomfortable.  I saw them on a friend and she loved them so that's the reason for the purchase.  Nothing wrong with them good style well made just not for my foot.
"NO POCKETS,OOPS"
cheap looking-- kids may like it if the battery lasts until Christmas.  You should look for  something better spend the little extra you will be happier than I am
"made my feet hurt just trying em on!!

smells horrible and the quality is poor. design is nice if made with better matterial. soles are not cushioned at all. theres no support at all.

on top the seller requested a $20 restocking fee. and for me to pay to return em."
"I had high hopes for these shoes, but the arch support is too far back in the shoe and hits the front of my heel, making them uncomfortable to wear.  I will be returning them."
Made of a pretty crappy material. Holding up to the light you can see through them. I am willing to bet they won't last very long.
Too small in toe box and across foot. Bought normal size.
Cool looking boot but you 'get what you pay for'
"I ordered for a trip and it said it would be here before we left. It came while we were away. I ordered an XL, it would better be labeled a men's medium USA."
It just looks and feels cheap. Not at all what I would have expected from London Fog.
Hideous shapeless piece of plastic
Color is very different than in  the photo.  I returned mine.  Fit is nice but color is more of an orangy-pinkey color that is not very flattering.
There is a lot of material and there was a rip in the seam after one 30 minutes throw over my swimsuit for a trip to the pool. Had to return.
i got the 2x which is about a US small/med. it has a strange smell and the material reminds me of that thin foam stuff that my flat screen tv was wrapped in when i got it. its very very cheaply made and im not sure if the stitching will survive the washing machine. im going to wash it and see what happens and repost the results
Ordered as a wide width shoe.  Absolutely not wide width.
"Purple rabbit version arrived faded, and got worse with washing."
"I did read the reviews ahead of time and just hoped that since most people liked it that it was a good quality product. The 2nd time we used it in the rain, it broke. It would not stay open and the top button came off. I was not playing with it, just trying to buy a good quality umbrella to use. It looks more durable than cheap umbrellas but it is not a good quality made umbrella. I am trying to find out just how to contact the company. They say there is 1 free replacement. I was hopeful for a better guarantee. I was hopeful but disappointed."
"I ordered the XL based on other product reviews.  I normally wear a large in Misses.  This hung on me to my shins.  (i am 5 ft 3) and was so baggy.
The XL is like a 4XL"
"This can not be a brand  Calvin Klein !!!  The nets stick out, the zipper is bent, the cheap material ... I do not recommend  !"
Frame Leans to the left
"My 16 year old son did not like these.  He said they did not look like real gauges in any sense.  He tried a pair on, but never wore them."
"Pros:  Comfortable, true to size, constructed of sturdy leather, convenient Velcro straps for quick ""lacing.""
Cons: Inside of the shoe where the tongue is fastened was manufactored sloppily so the excess material rubs against the top of my big toes and causes blisters even with thick socks.

If you don't mind applying bandage strips on the top of your big toes every time you take a walk with these shoes to prevent blisters, then these shoes are OK.  Otherwise, it should be a consideration before purchasing.  For me, I wouldn't purchase these shoes again. Very poor design."
Bought these for my 6 yr old daughter to wear in a school play. They were good material but they were almost too small for her. I bought according to the size chart but they were very short causing the crotch to hang low.
"These are really beautiful boots, but not built for active children.  My daughter ruined them on her first day wearing them. She scrapped up the toes and the fabric completely came off both shoes.  I had to throw them out after she only wore them one time to school.  Ugh, why can't they make decent quality shoes for kids?"
I ended up returning this blazer.  It's made very well and would recommend it to ladies who are not top heavy. The blazer does not offer a nice shape for large boobs and smaller waists women.  It's a little thicker too - so it would have been great for fall weather.
"I expected more from Italian sterling, which is usually very nice, but this looks more like what you get from a beach vendor in Cabo San Lucas.  It is very thin and would be overwhelmed by a pendant of any weight, and unless you're pretty thin, it will fit like a choker.  It seems like the people who gave this a high rating were looking at a different item than those who were not satisfied.  I will be returning the items - bought one for myself and one as a gift, but it is definitely not gift-worthy."
Amazon sent men's shoes and the description says kids and needed these for my 2 yr old grandson for Easter! Ugghhh was soo mad when Iopened box!
I was really excited for this.... however what I received in the mail was NOT what I had ordered
"Wash first! The color runs! Much cheaper made than all my older ones. Zipper sticks and is
shorter in width so credit cards just squeeze in. A little large for small wrists but just put
lots of stuff inside then it fits ok."
Expensive and did not last long enough. Do Not Buy
"Terrible cheap watch that looks and feels poorly made. This watch is not up to Casio standards. It may be inexpensive, but it is not worth it. Spend a little more and get a higher end Casio or a Seiko. After a few weeks I gave it to my nephew who is 12. He seems to like it ok."
sleeves are too short.
"These run VERY small!  I have a few 41 waist and ordered size XL. These are the size of a Med to Lrg.  They look like bikini underwear on me. Im 64 years old. I don't wear bikini underwear.  Considered ordering some more in XXL, then saw that the price jumps to 27.88 for the 6 pack. Ridiculous!  UPDATE:  after only 4 washings, they're completely falling apart!"
Completely see through after the first wash( black ones) and do not fall from waist as pictured on the model with no hips.  I am beginning to learn that trick with this kind of product. No washing instructions either. Dryed them for kicks and they shrunk up and went see through.
"I ordered this to be able to wear with my wedding ring but it looks too fake, it looks like the play jewelry you get from the 25 cent machines."
"Sizing is off,"
"These are completely see through.  You have to wear white or a light color under it to be appropriate to go anywhere.  I'm a mom, so yea, no thanks"
These items broke while on travel. Had to return them
"This was a very thin wig, you could see the netting through the hair. Returned right away"
Had to return because the size was way too small!
"Crown design flaws in the pocket to take the phone will often be pulled out, resulting in the watch to stop running. I do not know why I got the watch, the watch has been running, and did not take the protection mode does not run. Do not know how long this watch can be used, and now do not intend to return the. Because I want to know how long it will be?"
"1. I washed the beanie when it arrived put it on and my forehead started to itch and burn after a few minutes.  I thought it might be the detergent, so I ran it through a rinse cycle, washed with a hypoallergenic detergent, ran it through an extra rinse cycle just to be sure and after wearing for a few minutes, my forehead began to itch and burn AGAIN! I have quite a collection of beanie style hats and have NEVER had a reaction like this.

2. Unless you have a pea head, you're not going to get the typical slouchy beanie look with this thing. I've got an average size melon for a man and this thing doesn't do the slouchy thing as advertised.

3. Meh !"
I do not care for the length.
Looks good but it came broken at the hair piece
Doesn't do anything! No lift or nothing!
I ordered a size 20 or 22 and my sister who wears a 14 could barely get into it. She has a large bust and her bust was compromised when she tried it on. I actually bought it for my mother.
"Very weird construction, but someone small might like it see-through all the way in the back so you be the"
I absolutely loved this sweater until I hand washed and air dried it. It shrunk so much and lost its shape.
"Cute...but WAY too small, I weigh 115lbs, and I could not even get this on (I purchased the small size).  This feels like it is sized for a small child, not an adult."
Had to return them because they were not blue as described but a purple lens.
"I ordered a size large so that it would be as baggy on me as it is in the picture. Well, that's not the case. When I received it, I couldn't even get it over my shoulders, it looks like a size for a toddler. Don't waste your time or money."
This shirt was really small. I exchanged for a larger size and the shirt only got wider
"the fabric is pretty uncomfortable, not like other Hanes boxer briefs I've purchased at all, and they run pretty small."
"I bought this along with the Nanette Lepore Cap Sleeve Tee and UGH...so disappointing. The material is very sheer and flimsy feeling. The arms are extremely long ( I am 5'9"" athletic with long arms and they hang off me) and there is just an overabundance of loose material around midsection and length that looks unflattering, almost unkempt. Looks 4-5 star online but in person it's a solid one star."
The fabric was very thin and low quality. It wasn't worth it.
its says 7m.. but it fit like a 7 1/2 size shoe.. much 2 large... also hard 2 walk in!!
I never got to wear these shoes as they fit like a 9.5 or small 10.  I had thrown away all wrappings and have placed these in my Goodwill box.  Very disappointed in the size as they are really cute.
"These pants must not have passed someone by quality control. All stitching was frayed and crooked.
I like the style, but don't trust what these companies are selling on Amazon, especially cloathing."
"Cute but ridiculously too small.  I wear a 9, ordered a 10, and still too small.  Poor, very poor sizing.  I would need an 11, maybe an 11.5!"
Far larger than our child's shoes that are marked a the same size.
They look like old gramma shoes when they are on.
"I didn't have any problem with the quality of the material and the bottom fit great. But the top was huge!  I order size large as I wear a 10/12. The amount of the draping fabric (I bought the gray and pink stripped) was about 3 times too much so it hung horribly and there so much of it I could pull it down to almost me knees. Sent it back.
With the mixed reviews I had bought 2 different style but the same color and brand but in the traditional tanking top and it fit perfect."
I expected the fabric at 60% cotton to be less like polyester double knit and more like cotton.  The fabric feels more like 100% polyester.  It may be an okay fabric for some people but it is too stretchy and too much like 1970's double knit fabric to suit my taste.  But I like the sequins.
These don't stay on.
This isn't the style I prefer. It's tighter on the top than the other grey's anatomy bottoms. I hate the flare in the legs
These are okay. Very tiny. I had to use different posts. With kids it is impossible to put the back on. My daughter has been wearing these continuously for two weeks now. Stones are falling off. Please don't buy.
No support . No good on the first wear. No bust support. I really wanted to wear this out. no thanks
Eh...ideal for a young kid.
This definitely doesn't fit like a 9. They're much too big. :(
"I ordered this same gown earlier in black and it is a perfect fit and my favorite. The red gown is a size smaller even though marked as ""size large"".  I expected it to fit so discarded tags and shipping receipts before trying it on. Learned my lesson and will now just give it away to a smaller person and will always save return paperwork until sure item works."
"They don't look quality so I am returning them.  I would say they would be okay if darker,  but otherwise look like they came from a Walmart bin"
"Tried ordering this ring 3 or 4 times, i kept getting an earrings and necklace instead.  Very disappointing I really wanted the ring but will not attempt to buy it again"
"I love Fitflop boots. I have these in black leather and they're awesome. I ordered these and I should have listened to the reviews! I thought since I have a pair of the Crush boots ( but in leather) that these qould fit in the same size... NOT EVEN. These are a whole size big. Gigantic. I went to ""exchange"" them for a size smaller and the price went up ( I ordered them and had them in two days-- not sure why I was offered the even exchange, but I wasn't. Yes, I asked Amazon to just exchange for the smaller size. I will say I loved the color and they seemed like they'd be really comfy, but they were so big I couldn't walk without them flopping off of my feet. I normally wear an 8. So I have ordered these in the tan color. We will see how that goes. I'll revise my review if the second pair fits better. It's totally unfair that the price went up so much in two days and they wouldn't honor!"
"Shirt is not as advertised.  I received a not very stylish Jerzees brand t-shirt with a grainy, pixelated Man of Steel l logo on it.  For this price, t-shirt should be of a higher quality.  The navy blue is also a little too dark."
"I have bought similar pull on bras, in stretchier fabric, in a medium.  I normally wear a 36 A and am 138 lbs but these were just too tight.  Had to return them."
"Disappointed that within 2 years, the watch failed. The Watch Battery people tried, but said it needs to be rebuilt.
[And my wife so LOVED the design, even the larger face.]
SO Disapointed !!"
Fit is large reordered twice and still larger than my normal size. Disappointing they can't get standard sizing correct.
"these look better in the photo than in reality and the fit was awful; plus, these shoes look terrible. I am a size 6 with a petite built - the shoe made me look like I was wearing clown shoes"
I wear a small but ordered a medium and they were still WAY to small.
"poor quality , poor fabric"
Not what I expected. Disappointed.
"Very small, ordered a 10 ad it feels like an 8."
Did not like the way the bottom of the dress hung. Too many lose threads
"Wrong size, too small."
Product is not as fitting as the competitor brand.without realizing this is a different brand all together
"Tried one in the store and bought it online but it was a different  kind of shoe . Too big , different fit !"
"This is the worst belt I have ever purchased, it is useless.
The ratchet slips constantly and the belt loosens.
It is so bad all you need to do is slip a finger under the belt and give it a slight touch and the belt loosens a couple notches.
Worthless

This item is cheap and flimsy compared to my other shemaghs from a reputable source. The weave is loose and the colors are not vivid. Item returned for full refund.
"I purchased these shoes, because I have actually been using a much earlier version of this shoe to run in. I ordered half a size up from my older version, so I would have more room for socks during the colder temperatures. With these being the new ""relaxed"" fit, I found my foot was slipping around too much. I am also not at all a fan of the memory foam. The way I am as a runner, I need to reduce my foot motion. Memory foam and ""spongy"" or ""cushioned"" shoes do not do well for me. They are great for walking around in, though that really wasn't the intended purchase of these shoes for me. I could see where you could easily turn an ankle in these, as the area around the ankles is extremely loose, with tons of give. It all depends on what you are looking for, but this shoe really did not work well for what I was looking for."
"I would like to exchange these pants for the relaxed fit style. They are way too tight even though they are correct size. I have never returned anything if you look at my purchase history. I had an illness in the family in another state and have had no time to return these. Please allow me to return these and get bigger style. My husband needs these for work! Thank you so much Ellen Longenecker

Unhappy don't care for it
"I own two pairs of these and love them to death!  They are very durable, comfortable, and light.

So, you may be wondering why I'm giving this 1 star?  Because I just ordered these in grey and instead of receiving the 'Blended Twill' as I ordered (like the two I own already), I received the 'Twill' which is much heavier and baggier.  I had to return this.

This makes me wonder if the people that are packing the orders know the difference between the two ( Twill and Blended Twill) or they ran out of Blended Twill??"
The Velco GAVE OUT on the left shoe and I haven't owned them for long. I tried to clear out anything that was keeping the velco from sticking but it still won't stay on! I owned a pair of these shoes before but the velco didn't give out so I am not sure what happen.
"I like Naturalizer shoes and have generally had good luck with them fitting my narrow foot.  But not in this case.  The toe box and lower arch fit well, but the strap over the arch did not cover the velcro, even when cinched as tightly as possible.  Also the shoe did not look good on my feet.  Thus it will have to be returned."
Looks better in the picture :( I was looking forward to this scarf
Definitely did not look or fit the way it's pictured
"This was the second order we had placed for Rockports.  This pair was supposed to be 8.5EEE, and was the same as the regular width."
Strap broke while trying it on for the first time! Poor workmanship!
The one I received didn't look like the picture! I returned it!
"As other reviewers said, the heel is very high. They are not comfortable and hard to walk in. I also think they look better in the photo than in real life."
They're okay...lasted a few months. Nothing like the capezio tights I bought at a professional dance store...those lasted years.
They were a little big and didn't fit right.
Very disappointed. One arm broke off within one week of use. No Hinged side pieces~!  More expensive is NOT always better~!
Too big and bulky and fingers still get cold
"I bought my daughter these Tevas in every size since she started walking at 9 months.  We loved the style and how easy they were to put on her tiny feet.  They also were comfortable on her and didn't hold her back from running around.  Once we got into the bigger sizes they just lost their 'cuteness'.  (kinda like a grown man wearing crocs).  Don't get me wrong, Teva is a great brand and the shoes are awesome quality, but any size after a toddler 9 is not so cute.  They looked huge and gawdy.  We returned them."
We returned these. The soles were not comfortable like the other Croc slip-ons we got for my partner.
Tiny cheesy. Back tore off two first use.
Had an allergic reaction to the metal so if you have sensitive skin you might want to think twice
"East coast plus sized women would be self conscious with is size I ordered a 18W what I got to me was a 12 reg. sized. LOL.
would not order again.  In fact I have to give this away even if I lost 150lb. I could fit it. LOL"
"I have ordered Haggar Men's Cool 18 Hidden Expandable Waist Plain Front Pant,Navy,35x30L. What the picture is showing what I received is different. It is the second time this happened with this retailer. I have no idea why they deceive customers. Both times different texture, different type cut. For the first time, I ordered two different colours but the same Cool 18 Hidden Expandable Waist Plain Front Pant. One is the correct, the other is totally different cut style."
"I got this watch and loved it for a while, but I kept noticing the pin holding the door on kept wiggling loose.  I kept pushing it back in, but one day it came loose and I couldn't find it again.  I haven't really been able to use the watch since.  Buy a higher quality watch."
"They are nothing like the photos.
Cheap and some of them didn't even have a diamond..."
"This item is (USUALLY) awesome! I can't go barefoot or in non-supportive shoes because of a foot issue, so I live in these at home. I actually have 2 pair at home right now, they're just getting old and worn. I was unable to use this specific item because I was sent the wrong color item and it was obviously used."
"Honestly, I had high hopes for these socks but see above. Just getting by with these, next time will go for Hanes, much thicker socks for cold weather."
"I got these all in black and unpacking them the plastic hangers shot through the socks snagged on the socks first thing.  I then washed and dried them before wearing them.  They came out of the dryer unwearable, hundreds of pills on each sock.  You might be able to wear these if you hand wash each sock individually.  I also noticed that they are literally different sizes, lengths, i.e. there is no quality control on the sizing of these socks nor on the lack of a quality product.  Ripped off by this product and steaming about why Amazon would carry such a sub, sub, sub standard product???  Maybe the other colors and patterns are different but I don't know and wouldn't risk two cents to find out!  I rarely if ever write reviews for products here at Amazon, but when a product is this unusable, I believe fair-warning should be given by customers."
"Huge disappointment, fell off in 2 minutes."
"Went based on the sizing chart and they were too small. I'm 5'3"" 120-125 and I ordered a medium. When I received them in the mail they smelled horrible and we're sort of stiff so I washed them right away without drying. I tried them on and they were almost squeezing my thighs. I wanted these as comfy pants so that wasn't going to work. I'll give them to my 11 year old daughter to avoid the hassle of returning and going through the rigmarole but quite frankly my daughter has enough pants and I don't so this was a very disappointing purchase."
"Although this robe fit as expected, the sewing was poor. It tore at the seams when my granddaughter sat down while wearing it."
Too tight  on my  wrist
"Fast shipping, colors as described and purses look just like the pictures, the hats came so tight to make the packaging smaller that they are all wrinkled, im stuffing it with things to help them open up but i don't think they will be ready for my daughters birthday in 3 weeks and on top of everything the hat's flaps are slightly smaller than pictured which makes the hat looks smaller and not as nice as the pictures, very dissappointed  :-("
I loved this shirt and I had a planned for wearing for tights and so forth. I ordered a large based off the reviews I read and it was way too big for me. I suggest you order two size smaller to actually get the results that shoes in the picture because on me it looked like a night gown and it was very very thin(you will have to wear another shirt underneath it as well)...
These were marked XXL when in fact were XL. It took two emails and two phone calls to get a return merchandise label. Refund requested. Quality wasn't good. Would not buy these again.
"Very dissapointed, i ordered medium but they gave me large which is toooooo large i think this is XXXL but they insist i ordered large ok fine if i ordered large this is toooo BIG i think XXXL.
So very dissapointed."
"It kind of works... I gave it 24 hours to try on the two rings I wanted to wear, but after 1 day it fell off.  I tried it again by putting more on and wrapping it around the ring, and had the same issue.  I wouldn't recommend"
"It's a monster size watch and very heavy again the due to amazon's poor description online I didn't get that I had expected. I got a big ,thick, heavy ghetto looking watch that can be used as a roman shield, sap ,  get two and you got some blingy heavy hands for you daily run. I am a big guy so I could work around the size but it was too bloody heavy. It work ok but be aware this is a huge heavy watch. I returned it do poor description it's big very thick and heavy. Amazon needs to add the actual weight of the watch in their descriptions I do not like any watch weighting more than one pound rarely is the watches weight is listed it would have saved me two returns if the real weight was posted."
Very cheap looking.  The quality just wasn't there.  They were a good price but you get what you pay for.
Nivel but to small
"I need a work shoe really bad and this looks similar to my current Naturalizer work shoes so I gave it a try.  I was really disappointed.  The shoe was too short, the material it is made of was very hard and not very giving, and it looked cheap."
Huge boxy fit.  Probably two sizes too big
"These are said to be 'regular fit'. They are NOT. They are 'extra room in thigh', which is on the tag. That is NOT regular fit."
"Very lightweight, cheap feeling and cheap looking to me. Returned it."
"I have ordered from this company many times. All leggings have fit perfectly
In the past. I am unable to wear any of the new leggings.
What happened to the past sizing. Do not order from this company. The leggings are now extremely small. I have six pairs of new leggings that I can not wear due to size and cannot return them"
"Confusing...design is very grandmother (not what I was going for) and yet, the fabric is completely see through (more than what I was going for)."
The shoes fit fine but the heel was so oddly placed that it offered no support for walking. It was as if I was walking on rocks. I sent them back
"I used to wear Levi's exclusively. I'd wear 505 for work, and 501 stf for good. I stopped buying the 505 when they changed the rise to fit below the waist. I stopped buying the 501 stf when they changed the denim weight and stitching. On a whim, I tried the 501 stf again just to see if maybe they improved them. They didn't. I will say that I like the fit and cut of the 501 stf. But that's about it. I still have pairs from about 6 years ago that were over 13 oz denim. These are between 12 oz and 12.5 oz. They just feel flimsy at this weight. And the new stitching ( inseam, hem and pockets) make these look like woman's jeans. These are certainly not worth the price. I have been buying Wrangler. They have a style that they haven't changed by even one stitch since 1947. It's their best selling style. That's because guys know exactly what they're going to get - 14.75 oz denim, natural rise, 18"" leg opening and the stitching is always the same. Levi's claims they make changes to styles to keep them 'fresh and current'. It looks like they take away quality and raise the price. Levi Strauss must be turning in his grave. Especially with this style that made Levi's a brand name. Levi's could learn a lesson about not changing what works from their competitor. The 501 stf's I just bought will either be donated to Good Will, or used as garage painting pants. Or maybe I'll give them to a woman. I'm embarrassed to wear these in public."
"These are pretty much crap. Very, very hard to squeeze any type of lotion out of them unless totally full. Works semi alright with softer liquids such as facewash. I've used two, probably won't even use the rest of them"
Green finger cheap made.. don't waste your money...
These are beautiful and they look good on but I have never been in such pain in my life. I wore them to a concert and I seriously could barely walk back to my car. It hurt so bad that I walked barefoot through the gravel parking lot back to my car because it was less painful. I feel sad because they are so pretty and I am out the money because I will never wear them again
within two times wearing the headband the jeweled party detached from the stretchy party
I ordered the larger size like stated in the description and the swimsuit is still to small.  I won't recommend to anyone buying swimsuits from the internet.  Go into a mortar and brick building where you can actually try the suit on.  It may have been priced right but it fits all wrong.
"Although the pants are fine...for someone 5'8"" (or taller)...that is NOT ME!  I am 4 inches shorter than that and there is no way I could wear these without dragging them and tripping over them.  They are the type of material that would be impractical to hem, so these britches had to be returned,"
I love them!!! I just wish they fit! :( if u have big calfs don't get them... they will not fit... I got them a size up hoping they would fit. where the foot is it fits great but when I tried zipping them up they would not cover my calfs... so wish they fit. :(
The stitching came loose after the first washing.
"I'm sure the watch is great, but it was delivered without a charger. Kind of worthless without that important piece. Returned. I was excited about this too."
"My son loved this backpack.  Unfortunately, it only lasted for 2 weeks of school.  The entire bottom of the bag came apart. His school bags normally last the whole school year.  I was really disappointed to have to replace this bag less than a month into the school year."
Way too small and not flattering. Had to return
This was super small on my little girl and I went back and read the info and never saw slim fit
This head band is already broken.
I did nit care for it. Looked different than picture. Kinda stiff looking.
"Ok two gripes;
1. is supposed to be high gloss. I could not get a high gloss out of this paste, at best I'd call it low sheen.
2. The stuff really smells awful! I mean its so strong that after I polished my shoes and buffed it off people complained about the fumes at work (I applied the polish at home). And at the end of the day when I put the shoes away at night my wife complained that the closet stunk like chemicals. A week after I applied this stuff and they still stink.

I have tried other colors and pastes from Saphir with no problems but this stuff is terrible. Next stop, the trash can."
"This is a good looking bracelet. However, there is no practical way to attach the medical and identification info onto the inside of the bracelet. If I could locate my shipping info, I would return it. Pretty worthless."
"The first time I wore these jeans, one of the rear belt loops came off at the bottom of the loop.  The inspector must have been absent that day.  The only good news is I have returned them to Amazon and a refund will be issued.  I am sorry that this legendary product is of such poor quality that a belt loop would come off, even without any stress.  If Levi's jeans are made so carelessly, it is shameful."
Horrible quality shirt used. Feels terrible in skin despite the fact it is actually cotton. Very stiff and scratchy. Beware. The graphics are very faded too-
Definitely WAY TOO small! In length and width!! I wanted to return them but I waited too long.
Ran after second use.
"UPDATE:  Sep 2012
I did not return these sandals as planned and I'm sorry I didn't.  These black sandals are lined with black suede. They did stretch out a little and I've worn them about 7 times now. The BLACK color has started to wear off on the bottom of my foot, which DISCOLORS MY SKIN.
TEVA offers a 1 year warranty against defective products.  I call this defective, my tan TEVA that are lined with leather DO NOT discolor my foot.  Now I AM returning if possible.

Not comfortable.
I have other TEVA sandals and I'm very pleased.
These are NOT up to TEVA standards.  The leather is cheap, stiff and uncomfortable, therefore it rubs against the toes.
I ordered two pair, in black and tan, I'll be returning both.
I don't recommend."
"If you need something to cinch you in, perhaps buying two sizes down will do something; otherwise, try a different shape-wear product.  This one is too light to beanything beyond a slip to line sheer clothing."
Fit not at all as expected.
"Cute concept for a shirt, but very very very small. I couldn't get it on at all and I ordered an extra large"
"Like the look of the watch and the ""easy read"" dial.  Nice to have the Indiglo feature. Band is a serious bummer as it pinches your skin with the slightest movement... and this was just trying it on. In addition, unless you have very large wrists, you will need to pay to get it sized."
"Orded them, had them on for about 15 mins, walked out to the car, noticed that the bottom was cracked, went inside, took them off, tryed to send them back was did not get refund because they hard ""wear and tear"" returns are a joke"
"okay so, this item is incredibly hard to figure out. Took me about two tries to put it on as the picture is shown here. And there is no, no way this fits me. The straps on the lower half are way too small even with the straps adjusted to the longest length. I'm not a big girl, I'm 37""b, 29w, and 36h and this suit cuts into my body making me look like some sort of abstract statue made out of playdough. If that wasn't bad enough, the stitching is just absolutely atrocious. The bows are all frayed and it's not nearly as sexy in person in my personal opinion. The garter straps do not look like the picture.

The only thing good about it is the stockings and that it shipped fast. I will not be using this item, I can't imagine any woman of average size fitting into it either. Please don't bother getting this item! I have ordered other G world things and have liked it but, trust me this is a waste of time if you're not an 24"" hip 0_o"
"these sneakers have a shape forming material at the top of it that create very painful friction on my big toe, forcing me to compensate on outer part of my foot, leaving me to limp for most of my walk. Very very very uncomfortable. Would not recommend to anyone."
"It feels like it is mostly a kind of stiffish spandex- with the description saying 95% cotton, it was unexpected. I usually wear xs or small, and I chose xs in this top for a more fitted look but it actually looked too big on me- more like a medium which is strange for something marked xs. I am 5'5"" and about 105 lbs. I had high hopes for this brand and me, as I sometimes have trouble finding xs tops."
"The color description states ""Black & White"" this is NOT ACCURATE at all.
The color description needs to be changed to ""BLACK & SILVER""!
Therefore, something that I thought I had purchased to match a costume is now not going to match!!"
Loved them . Look sharp and very comfortable
Way to small for baby only
the sole is very comfortable but the front straps are very painfull. shame
"Its much shorter than the picture on the website. I wanted to wear this with a pair of leggings or super skinny jeans. But I cant do that because its of normal length. I can still wear it, but, Ill need to wear different bottom."
"Hate this shirt! Nothing like the picture. Not a slught fitted look, and sleeves are full length. Picture is deceiving. Boo!!!"
"Updated review: disappointed in the quality.  A hole has worn through under the heel in less than a month.  My previous pairs of Carhartt's womens socks were the ""Extremes All-Season Boot Sock"" which lasted well over a year and were extremely comfortable and warm so will buy them again. Thought I would try the higher woolen content socks this time but not a success."
I returned this item because I felt it was poorly made and quality wasn't that good. I received a refund once I sent the item back.
"The support in these fun, cute shoes is terrific. Unlike my other Jambu shoes they just refuse to be broken-in. The gold lining inside the cut-outs seems to be the issue. Whereas the other Jambu shoes adapted to my feet within the first wearing, it seems that the lining in these, which is not leather, is keeping them stiff, inflexible and therefore fairly uncomfortable. Disappointing."
Size 10 fits like a size 9. Recommend going one size up from what you normally wear unless you wear a 10 then your just out of luck.
"Sanita's are similar to Danskos, which is my go to winter clog.  I am returning this pair, as the product is not as pictured.  I see a bone/off white color.  What I received was dark tan and it was not anything near the color in the picture.  Also, the shoes came in a larger than necessary box.  Where is the Sanita box??  Makes me think this pair was repackaged for some reason, or perhaps a knock-off.  Not a happy customer."
"I love the way the photo shows the shoe. However, they were a big disappointment on fit.
Not having any stretch or adjustments for the width, I found them tight across the leopard cross piece.
I do wear this style but in many other brands. Try Echo or Stuart Weitzman next time."
"Different than the picture!! These pictures show a cardigan, front and back, that ends below the hips and has a mostly straight hem (which I wanted). The cardigan received ends just below the waist in the back, and slopes down to two predominant hanging points in the front. This means I can't wear it the way I wanted, or the way it is SHOWN. NOT what I wanted. Misleading picture. :-("
"Pendant only. No chain as described. Rip off!!

Edited to add that Amazon gave me a partial refund to compensate for the missing chain. I appreciate Amazon's support, but I will be avoiding Argenti di Lusso in the future."
"These shoes are tremendously uncomfortable. It's mainly because of the toe area. It's too bad because the insole has so much potential. I even had them stretched in the toe area but to no avail: they feel like my toes want to literally scream out loud ""let me out of here!"" I wish they would make these with a wider toe area and a slightly pointed toe not a round toe. I mean slightly pointed not extremely pointed."
Horrible fabric. Would not buy again
This is not for a child. It was too large for my head. It is not made very well. The front that lights up just fell right off. Could not be used. Do not recommend.
Way too small. I am sure the sizes posted are for models or the sizes are asian.
"I bought this for myself and gave it to my teenage daughter; it runs very very small. Great for younger girls, certainly not adult-sized"
These did not work and kept breaking
Cheap metal broke for the shoulder strap the first day I used the purse.
I bought a size 8 because I have another pair of Asics that is size 8. This shoe feels like it is a half size too small. I should have ordered 8.5 in this shoe.
size and quality was wrong and poor.
It felt cheap and uncomfortable. I returned it. The fabric was loose and I could tell they wouldn't last.
Big enough to sink a battle ship!!
"Warm, and comfortable.. but cheap. The rubber is already peeling away from the neoprene. I work in Yellowstone National Park, so I've been able to test them out in snow, slush, and solid ice. Wish they would've lasted more than 2 weeks!"
Very beautiful shoe but way too small and I usually wear a 10.
The picture online makes it look like both sides of the cardigan extend down below waist level. I had no idea that this cardigan features an asymmetrical flourish - one side is completely straight across while the other side is longer and dips down below the waist. It looks strange and I would never have ordered if it the picture had accurately shown the asymmetrical hem.
color is pretty but wig has no volume
I compared to my previous pair...about a inch shorter. Returning.
It is so ugly and so wide. I am returning them.
"Ordered black, received a brownish color. Picture was taken wearing black pants (faded) and a pair of black shoes. Order came fast, however these do not feel like authentic Tom's. Very hard, bottom is extremely slippery, no grip whatso ever it causes you to slide on anything but carpet. Not very happy with my purchase. I've ordered over 100 items from Amazon over the past 5 years and this will be the first time retuning a product."
"looks super cute, but is super small even for a average size newborn."
"I did not like these. I am 115 lbs they fit me very loose. They are ugly. For the price, i bought them as a one time use for a costume and still did not bother to wear them. They arrived on time"
"Forget it, go for Clarks."
It's Not that bright in the night
"Never used them outside of the house bc my pinkie toe fights to get out of the shoe.  Way too narrow for me.
Waited too long and now I cannot return them. BOOO!"
"These are physically painful to run in. I have high arches and use custom insoles but these were just awful. The pain hits when I land on my foot, every step, both feet. They're okay for walking but terrible for running."
"Cheap, and it looks it!!!"
"Too small, too tight & not at all what i was looking for. I wanted more of a gored type skirt."
Didn't like this bra and returned it. Playtex bras just don't fit my body!
I will be throwing these away when I get home today. I wore them and I lint rolled 4 times during the day. They collect every fuzz you could possibly imagine! Terrible.
from ankle to mid calf way too wide
"Super soft and comfy, but had a hole in it after only one time wearing it."
Will order AGAIN!
"I live in my Reefs. I've been buying Reefs for over 20 years now. I really wanted to love these and I do like the color and they are cushy. But they don't fit. You need to have long, very skinny feet to wear these comfortably."
PLEASE NOTE THAT I DID NOT ORDER THIS ITEM.L
"Ordered 2 sizes up and still doesn't fit. Not impressed with quality either, returning."
"These are just okay. I have a very similar pair from CuddlDuds that I bought through a different website that are much thicker and substantial. This pair is thin (prone to static) and feels ""cheap"". I'd buy CuddleDuds again, but not from here."
"Beautiful design; however, the band broke after the 2nd use."
"Beautiful looking gloves, but very tight, and the fur keeps shedding--besides individual firs, a whole chunk came out when I was pulling out my hand.  I think I may need to return them."
"I normally wear a large but this was sized more like a medium/small. The sleeves were oddly tight, as if women are only supposed to have tiny stick arms. It's uncomfortable and I can't wear it. The fabric is thin as well, more like an undershirt."
Too stiff and too narrow. I don't know how I could possibly exercise in these. Maybe people can wear them for walking around. Not for me!
Really big and loose in the shoulders. Amazon gave me credit as the seller did not respond to my request for a return. I normally wear size 8 but based on some reviews decided to order the large instead of medium. It was way too big. And the neckline was so huge and gaping. I probably would fit a small except the sleeves were not long enough for my long arms either.
items battery was dead on arrival.
I rarely put on an 8.5 medium width shoe that does not fit!  These shoes were loose on my feet and slid up and down on my heel.
Built for a bigger hipped woman and can't adjust down.  I'm a size 6 jean.  Otherwise good for bigger hips.
"Received my boots today and they did not have the fleece inside. Returning.  I checked them out at a store in the mall and these totally look fake. I'm a Timberland wearer and I noticed soon as I took them out the box. I don't know how some of these review are saying that they love them. They are not what is in the picture or what I seen in the store. Now, Timberland does make a pair without the fleece but these still don't look right. I am just gonna pay full price at the mall."
"Was sent the wrong color (letters were black also).  The Reebok quality (sturdy, supportive, durable) wasn't what I'm accustomed to as well."
"Even though I bought exactly by the chart, I could not it get up to my thighs! I am 5'5"", 146lb bought size 2. Very disappointed, went size bigger than usual..

the material is kind of nice, but I am not certain  I can call it SUPER OPAQUE..."
"Extremely thin fabric. Hard to tell whether it runs big or small, as the material became completely see through at the slightest stretch. Be advised, to return this item, I had to ship it to Britain. The seller did not pay for a label.  Overseas shipping is not inexpensive."
These were cumbersome to use. Waste of money!
did not look good. Hung like a sheet. buttons didn't stay close. cheaply made. Returned it.
"Too small, not long like the picture..."
This robe is soft and plush.  My son was so excited to wear it!  After one week the shoulder seam ripped. My son is petite so this should never have happened.  Pretty disappointed considering the cost.
"Crappy assy!  Tried to insert battery and the little screw that holds the lid on the bottom once off is hard to get back in place.  Not only that, the internals are glued and after couple times of discharging the stick, the cylinder came off the holder.. and you can see the glue that was poorly wedge in between.  I've ended up wire-tie the inside and took some electrical tape to keep the thing together... it is now sturdy and don't really notice the black wire tape which is strong and sticks to the plastic well."
Not really happy with the quality at all. Very thin material and not what I'd consider worth the money. I think they spent more time/quality on the removable tag with the bran name. This XXL shrunk to a large after the first wash with cold water and low temp tumble dry. This shirt is in the sub-$20 quality range and would never buy again.
"These are really cute, but the material isn't comfortable. They are also not good for wide calves. I didn't return them, but I don't wear them."
"No way. Definitely shows the seam through T-shirts, which is a deal breaker for me. Also the fabric is so thin that nips show through."
He won't even wear it. Its costume like. I thought hed like this one hes a big fan of the Dickies Brand. Its not going to get any play in these streets.
See thru material :(
The boot was suppose to be 2E in with but they were to tight.
Both bracelets came apart upon opening the package :( You get what you pay for.
"I purchased this for my daughter. This is by no means a full size backpack. Which is ok. Within 4 hours of opening the box, both of the zipper pulls broke off of the zippers. Maybe I had my expectations a little too high, but zippers, really? I would expect the handle to break before the zippers."
Poorly made. Shrinks and doesn't fit well.
"I normally wear a size 8 shoe, but I had trouble getting my foot into this boot and that process made my toes, feet, and calves cramp mercilessly."
Sweater I received looks totally different. The picture on my sweater is shorter and more distorted. Not cute at all!
It's more of a strap than a belt
I bought a full complete size up and they are still too small. Will not be able to run in them.
Returned because one fit and one didn't. Cute shoes though
"So I am on the lower end of plus-size clothing (18W). Looked at the sizing chart and thought okay, these should fit, as plus size starts at a 1x. I ordered the two black, one charcoal set. The charcoal one fit like a charm, one of the black ones didn't fit at all, and the other black one fit just okay. And by okay, I mean that it kept wanting to roll down my ass as I walked around. Never buying from this seller, again."
The clasp broke when my 13 year old niece put it on the first time. Poor quality.
"3x does not fit, it is small. I usually wear a 2x. This material is thin and the Blazer looks like a shirt."
It's way too Small and not worth purchasing. i don't like this umbrella and thought it was larger in size.
completely see through! do not recommend at all
"The costume looks nice in the picture. I didn't find it to be very nice in person. It is a small fit, so be careful."
The material started pilling with the first wear! Not very good quality.
Straps couldn't make more narrow
Dockers far too large. the waist is too low and uncomfortable. I will return them tomorrow to Amazon.
These didn't fit my athletic shoes.  I gave them to a relative with a toddler.  Maybe they will fit her shoes instead of mine.
"Horrible product! Very cheap made. The information stated that it included the headband and braids,but there were no braids at all. I also hate false advertising.

[...]"
This suit is a joke.  Don't waste your time.  Skip to the next suit on your list.  The suite comes way bigger then expected.  The black cover up is more like a piece of lingerie.  The bottoms are made of poor quality.  And the top is not supportive at all.  I returned this suit immediately.
did not like.  size ran small and slippery bottoms
"Cute dress but I had to return it. I normally wear M, but this dress runs large. I ordered it in M, then purchased a S one but it was still big on me. Its also a maxi dress for petit women. The colors are very pretty."
"Product is just OK.  Rubber is soft and it comes with all the accessories needed which is nice.  I purchased 2 of these.  One came already opened, although all the accessories were there and the band was fine, except for the fact that the buckle was installed backwards.  Just seemed odd that the packaging was already torn open and items weren't packaged but loose in the package.  My guess was someone tried to install the strap reversed for the look and it didn't fit, so they returned it.  The holes for the middle buckle pin aren't punched out, and while trying to punch it through with, the pin fell out.  I then realized it's not really held on that well to begin with.  I ended up using the tool to punch out the hole and re-installing the middle retainer.  For the price, it's fine, but the fit isn't the greatest and it wasn't that easy to install."
This review is based solely upon the fact that my strap has broken (the metal clasp that attaches it to the bag) and I have reached out to Texbo through Amazon and have NOT received any feedback or reply at all. What makes a good product great is great service after the sale.
fit funny...had to return
They hurt very badly in the toe area.  ugh. Had to return. Bought another pair at Kohl's and they are fine.
"Really looks lovely on, but had a terrible reaction to the metal on my skin. Can't and won't wear again. You get what you pay for, but man did this set create a terrible rash on me."
The slit in the back ends at the small of my back. Can't wear it. Otherwise it would be a beautiful dress.
"Says ""100% Cotton"" and that's why I ordered it.  Received the sweat shirt today and the tag says ""50/50."" Therefore, I re-read the online description to find out how I screwed up.  Well, it appears, I have a case of premature cottonosis.  The first line of the description says ""100% cotton"" and that's where I stopped reading in my stupor of irrational exuberance in finding a 100% cotton sweat shirt.  In all fairness, I can speculate the description is less than false advertising as the 50% cotton content is made from 100% cotton.  Yeah, that's it."
boxy shape - unattractive
Do NOT buy this bra!  It fits as expected BUT there is a rubber/latex strip on the inside of the bra that rubs against your skin.  SUPER irritating.
"Color is really pretty, but the dress has no shape and looks like a moo moo. The ruffles we're seen on backwards. Not as flattering as I anticipated"
Glue came apart on the sole
Poor quality and fit for larger breasted women. No support and  shape. Cannot recommend.
They were not designed by a normal ties.. You need a slim one in order to fit properly.
"This scarf looks nice in the photo, but the quality is very poor. It is nearly see through. A complete waste of money."
"I really wanted to love this shirt. Like really really wanted. I order two sizes up in a vain effort to have it fit slightly and it does not. It is tight, see through, and the cheapest fabric imaginable. Don't waste your money."
"I haven't worn these shoes as the heel strap is too loose and I cannot tighten it any further with the velcro.  If it had a buckle and punched holes, it could be remedied.  I am going to take them to a shoe repair to see if they can put a new longer piece of velcro on the strap.  Otherwise the narrow size I ordered fits as expected."
This suit runs two sizes small on top.  I would recommend this for those who have a smaller bust but large hips and rear.  The belt on the bottom makes the suit look cheap.  I had to return.
had for just a few weeks before silver wore off.  too bad because I really like the look of the charm.
"After seeing British Racing Green swatched all over the Internet, I finally gave in and bought it. Unfortunately, for me it's been the same story s with a lot of other very dark colours: out of bright light, it just looks like black. I found it really annoying that once I'd put on enough to reach a good opacity, you really couldn't tell it was green. Since then, this expensive product has just sat in my drawers. I can't recommend this colour, but Butter London's Come to Bed Red is a staple for my nails. It's great!"
Received wrong size but I believe its manufacturer's error
Knock offs even if they say by Uggs. Did not keep my feet warm compared to my real ones.
"Beautiful top but the fit is just not there!!! It hangs ackwardly every where, the shoulders, the breast area, the front m, the back. When you lift your hands up, you can fully extend them. I can only wear this to the beach over a bathing suit, if that"
"I have to say I was so excited to get this boot in the mail.  I have heard great things about Keen, however after only wearing them here and there for about one month the zipper broke.  I can still close it but because of the way it broke the boots are no longer waterproof.  Now every time I go in the snow or rain my socks get soaking wet.  Not happy to say the least!  They say you get what you pay for however in this case i spent $150 which should get me a great quality shoe.... not one that breaks after only about 10th time wearing them."
I am not satisfied at all!!! It is nothing like the picture. It is very short..much like a tank top
Watch lasted 2.5 years and then stopped charging.  Battery replacement cost $55. Save yourself some aggravation and get a normal battery powered one and not a solar.
"when I received this necklace it was broken! I could not believe it it was very dainty and almost too small for a woman, I am 30 years old, but it was broken and had no way to contact the seller as I tried numerous times and very very very disappointed"
I received this today and I already have several Roxy rash tops. This one came and the black logo on the front was stuck together and peeled off the shirt. None of my others have ever done this. Next time I will be more careful where I order from. The tops do run small in general but this is a small and the others I have are small but not this small.
"My son loved the design of this bookbag. Unfortunately,  the strap has started to rip off after 1 month of use!  I have sewed it , I hope it will last him the school year!"
Love the color but the watch doesnt work. I am debating wether to buy a new battery or return the watch.
"This is described as a sweater but is really, really thin material. Was not at all what I expected. The quality of this product will affect my future purchases of clothing."
This was definitely a bad buy. The cowgirl hat they sent me was not in any form close to being a cowgirl hat!  looks like a fishing hat. This was a waste of money!
This bow is not sewed together so when you put it on it falls apart. I would not recommend this bow to anyone.
"Too big, though tight in the toe area. Flopped around on the back of my feet.
I returned them"
junk...  don't bother
Unfortunately this pair is just falling apart very fast. Button came off first day. I see a fray starting on the left leg. I guess I got a off pair...normally Ariat jeans are well made. Every other pair I have has been fine up to now.
it looked really dumb
"I have to say, when I first gave these as a meaningful gift, I was very happy. The recipient was happy - they were all he wanted to wear! But after about 5months, the material at the ankle and above broke his legs out SO BAD! He had to stop wearing them even though they're still in pretty good condition, the reaction coming out from the lining or materials inside the boot is too awful to bear. I won't buy them again and I will definitely tell anyone I know not to buy Harley boots. Stick with the bikes."
"As you can see from the 3 pictures I uploaded, both of the shirts I purchased are horribly sewn; the seams are crooked; the shirts are un-wearable. I am severely disappointed. I will be returning both immediately."
"Fit ok but is see through, even with the lining. Kind of makes you look like you are wearing a diaper."
"The earrings were large (not the usual 40 MM I pictured), the clasps were too strong for a convenient appliance and after a few days it gave me allergies. I requested a return and was refunded my money a few days later. 2/5 for material, 5/5 for customer service."
"I bought this same style of sandal, but with little ""crystals"" on the straps. All but two fell out in 1 season. In addition, the straps stretched out after about 4 months of light use making them unwearable. I paid a fortune in a bricks and mortar store for these sandals because I liked the comfort and I have plantar fasciitis. The quality is terrible, however."
"This is a bathing suit, not a sports bra as described. It offers no support. Granted, I have a 42DDD sized bust, and I was looking for something that I can run, dance, work out in that offers my full support and zero bounce. This was NOT the right bra for me. It would probably be fine for someone with small breasts who doesn't need a lot of support. I found the fabric was more conducive for swim wear than work out wear also. Its cute, but it doesn't serve the purpose I need. I am returning it for a refund.
Buyer beware: this seller was very unhappy with the honest review I provided and narrated me on multiple occasions to change or delete it. I will not be purchasing anything from them in the future due to the unprofessional nature of their contact."
A fickle pit
I don't know why everyone is acting like these leggings are magical. They are the same kind  of thin and crappy leggings you can find at a 99 cent store. I am extremely disappointed in these reviews and their dishonesty.
Too small to go around my wrist. Very cheap looking.
Came dirty with black spots on hood.  Not at all color fast. Red come off when attempting to get rid of dirt on hood. Poor quality in general.
These shoes are so cute but my daughter could not fit them. I would say order a size up.
"It is too big because when i walk those booties are so loose that it should be one size more because I ordered for size 8, this should be 8.5. it bad size... Trash!!"
"Bought the red and blue version in medium first and was not really fond of the color or the size. I decided to order the blue version in a small not only because it was cheaper but because I thought I would give the blue scarf shirt a try. I liked it much better. The colors are just what I expected and the size definitely runs slightly large. I am happy with my shirt!
Update: Does not wash well and now I have a very crooked shirt!"
POOR QIALITY MATERIAL
"A hole was worn in the toe after less than six months of normal wear. I normally love New Balance, but these we not made well."
"From reading the reviews I definitely had higher expectations than what I got. I sized up and got a medium (I usually wear a small) and I am thankful I did, the shirt would have been much too short on me had I not. The shirt is very thin and is definitely see through enough that I'd be uncomfortable to wear it out. Your bra is not clearly defined but is apparent underneath the shirt.

The fabric is definitely a rayon/polyester blend that doesn't flow very nicely and just ends up sticking out & making me look much larger than I am. I took on a chance on the price, but wish I had saved my $5 instead."
"Not impressed. Upon opening, I noticed pulled Strings on the visible part of the left shoulder but I didn't want to go through the return process. Its very soft but not great quality"
"I was very excited to get these shoes to try on but they were so painful I could only try them on for a few minutes.  The elastic that secures the shoe on the back of your heel was so unbelievably tight it left an indention on my foot and was super uncomfortable.  I loved the color and the design, but the fit was very disappointing."
fits long
"Looks very real, but I've only had it for three weeks and it is already missing a stone.  And, when it was returned I was charged a restocking fee for a faulty product!"
"Clearly in the picture the legs of the pants taper as you get towards the ankle, as they should.  The reality is the pants are as wide at the ankle as they are at the crotch.  Horrible cut, looks ridiculous.  Very disappointed.  I now have to decide to return or have the legs altered at the tailor.  Waist and length are good however."
I just can seem to win these days on amazon. Left heal squeaks and pops with every step loud enough for everyone to hear. Poor quality.im pretty sure this is a second and they are selling seconds as new.
"They were green instead of blue. I asked my granddaughter if she wanted me to return them and she said they were okay with her; however, I expected blue."
Very scratchy and fell to pieces. It's like the ends of the feathers were attached to one another by glue stick.
"Heavy rubber sole, size 12 fit more like a 13, and no shoelaces made me feel as if I would walk out of these shoes with each step.  Returned the item and found a lace up style at a local store"
This necklace felt cheap and looked unattractive. The chain's links kept turning and wouldn't lay flat. Returned and received a refund.
not warm
Size 24.  If I'm doing the correct pant
Ripped as soon as I tried to put them on
"Thin, shiny, and not at all worth the cost. Unfortunately, I washed the skirt, and now am unable to return it."
The shirt is so thin you can see rifht through it not worth the price.
"The company is wonderful. They sent me a large at no charge. I went small, thinking it would be ok. These are made for tiny people, perhaps people under or around 5ft tall. The torso is really short too. I loved the suit, but am still sad I never was able to wear one."
"Robe is very large for size I ordered.  I should have purchased a large, but got an XL and it hangs over my hands!  Nice color and good material."
These aren't as cute in person as in the photo. The leg opening is pretty large. I ordered my normal size and it was at least a whole size too big. I had to return them.
MATERIAL IS NOT THE SAME FOR COLORED PURSES. BLACK ONE IS PERFECT
It is gawdy and ugly. You could buy it for a dollar at a local dollar store.
"First of all, I would have rated this with a 5 but I agree with the one reviewer who indicated that the hook was heavy.  The hook is almsot heavier than the entire bag. Ok, maybe that might be an exaggeration, but it is heavy for no apparent reason.  I love the bag though and is the right size for me.  If you want to pack light, and need a bag that doesn't take up a lot of room, then I would recommend this one.  Also, I'm thinking about replacing the hook with a simple aluminum S-hook....as the hook easily detaches from the bag.

UPDATE:  I've traveled with this bag for the last couple of years now, and it has completely torn apart on both sides. First the right side seam ripped apart, shortly after I purchased it,  and then the left bottom portion. I've duct taped it and sewn it back together. I'm actually in Europe right now, and its barely holding on. Ive reduced my score from a 4 to a 2. I wouldn't recommend this bag, and there has to be better toiletry bags our there. Rick Steves should be ashamed to even have his name on these."
"I bought this as a gift, and overall it looks nice, but the face is a PRINTED WOODEN DESIGN. Not actual wood. I was really disappointed to see that. I don't know how it's held up, I'm just not thrilled with the face."
The ball diagram is much smaller on the shirt
I bought these for my Shaman Wolf cosplay. Im glad that I am a natural crafter. If I weren't my cosplay would have been ruined. These were too large. Even after cutting them down and trying to shape them. The glue did not work at all. I ended up mixing my own gluexperience with a lil crazy glue. They pic up any type of color real fast and stays. No way to clean them off that well. Not worth the money. I will tell ppl to mold thier own fangs out of moldable plastic. It's cheaper and not a time waster.
HORRIBLE!! So itchy and scratchy.  Couldn't get them past my knees.
They are very pretty but the screw backs are so small it was very difficult to get them in my kids ears and now I am a little worried they will be able to fit in their ear hole and cause problems. Don't seem appropriate to fit in kids ears as they are labeled for.
Less than four months and the crutch has has split wide open and its the material thats ripped not the stitching
"This in not flattering at all. It is short even for someone 5'3"" and is loose around the waist. If you are short and on the heavier side, it might work. Will be returning."
"The watch was real pretty, low profile but unfortunately for me a true sports watch is one that has a stop watch. This watch has a stop watch type of function but itonly goes to 60 seconds then starts all over again. I had to return it and buy a different sports watch to get the stop watch function."
"Like the design , if IOU set the time ones I if vice don't change it as it will break , was great for 5 month ..."
Most of my heels are 8.5 and I buy 9 in sneakers and boots. Bought these as a 9 and they were extremely small.
"Way, way, way too small. We ordered a 1X and i couldn't put it on my chihuahua. But I will admit the material was quality if I could wear it. Returned it."
"It looks completely different from the displayed photo. I know there is a difference in most things sold on the internet, but the cut and material is completely different. I guess it doesn't matter because who wants to look sharp while running but still, can't say I love it."
After a few hours of use the insole was coming apart. Needs like extra glue or better.
"Not at all slouchy as advertised. Very snug fitting, great comfy hat but definitely not slouchy. Returning to buy real slouchy version."
"Reviewers said the shoes were terrible, but I had to try them for myself... They are TERRIBLE! I wore them for 90 minutes walking along the beach, in and out of the surf, and by the time I was back at my car, they had fallen apart! The insole was loose and moving around, and the mesh on the top of the shoe had started to fray. Because I had not worn them immediately, I was over the 30 return limit, and could not send them back. I gave the pair I had bought my husband away, and put my shoes in the trash. Save your money, believe the reviews, and DO NOT BUY!"
"As soon as I placed this order for the sweater I immediately asked to be cancelled.  They refused.  I do not like the sweater.  And did not want it.  Will not fight over return.  Had to do that last year.  A bad company.  Why do I have to give this company a star before I submit.  They don't deserve a star..  The sweater looks nice , but not so much in person.  Mock pockets.  But very soft."
"The top didn't come far enough up on my foot, so the metal piece hit right on the big toe bone. Ouch. Plus pretty flimsy for that price. Sending back."
"Fast shipping, soft sweater, nice print. Unfortunately my sweater came with a crease down the middle that after washing(twice) and drying never came out. also tried an iron. tried contacting about a replacement but was given give little to no help.  Good luck!"
Broke down after two days. Not a quality product.
"Horrible cheaply made shirt!  I ordered three and sent them all back. The sizing is strange and based on the reviews and size information I ordered a size up, the shirts were so long they could have been dresses!"
"Had to send them back,  The back of the shoe came up too high on my heel and it rubbed."
The toe box was a bit small for the width of my foot. I had to send them back.
will make a good rag
The orange strap is way way to loose.  I don't have particularly small feet and as I am running 20lbs overweight my food is on the plump side but the orange strap stood up loosely and I could put my entire hand underneath.  Lovely  shoe but major design fault as the strap cannot be altered and made smaller
"Very baggy in the waist, poorly finished seams, cheap fabric."
"disappointing, it dips way too low at the center, tried to shorten it, but that just wasn't working too well either. Use it for scraps now. not worth buying"
"These shoes are the strangest fitting shoes I have ever come across! The heel is weird!! And, your foot, while inside the shoe is unlevel. UGH... returned immediately. I read the reviews and wished I had listened. I just loved the way they looked. : ("
"I wanted to love these after reading all the rave reviews and the price was great. However, when I put them on I knew right away that I wouldn't be happy with these even for a short walk, much less a cross country hike. I wear Asics for working out and hoped these would be comfy like Asics but more durable for outdoor use. Instead they felt like cardboard on my feet.  Not comfortable whatsoever. They also were too large and I wear a women's 10M in nearly every shoe out there. I returned them the next day and Amazon gave me a prompt refund. Sorry, I truly hate to leave bad reviews but want to be completely honest for the sake of others who are considering this purchase."
better to stick with spanx.  that brand fits well all the time
"Ended up returning this. The gun isn't the right gun for Indiana Jones, and it was orange and blue (I know, they have to make toys colorful so they are not thought to be real). The material this is made of is incredibly flimsy, and the belt is for someone with twice my girth. Maybe three times."
These used to be really nice but this version fell apart within a month
above the ankle bone is best!
I do not like the finish. The colour is too bright and the watch is light and looks cheap.
"The overall fit of this shoe is really too wide for an average foot and it's not as supportive as the LIV laceup which has the same bottom construction as this shoe.  I wore them so cannot return the pair.  I am using a thicker insole from a New Balance running shoe, which helps it fit somewhat better.

Plus the look of this shoe, because of the white trim on the sole, isn't all that great as an every-day shoe  - looks more athletic than I expected.  I have several pairs of Skechers which have become staples in my closet, for their design and look, but mostly their comfort and support.  This shoe is mediocre on all counts."
It looks cheaper in hand than it does in the picture
"i bought these slippers for my partner for christmas, 2013.  today, 3/2/2014, the whole front of the left slipper upper completely separated from the sole, leaving them unwearable, and my baby without slippers to wear.  minnetonka is an old, well-known company, and i have emailed the seller regarding replacement.  this is obviously a manufacturing defect.  we are very disappointed."
"Very pretty ring and fits as expected however, painful to wear. Ive only worn a few times because when I do, the points of the crown dig into and cut my skin. Looks way more expensive than I expected but the cuts just don't cut it."
These are very much so the most comical version of jeggings I've encountered. That said they are super comfortable and are good for working out or around the house.
This was not pebbled leather as they say. Looked like a fake. Very unhappy
"not supportive, runs small  lightweight bra for a junior."
Not comfortable at all !!! and not nice fit at all !
"I read the reviews and everyone said this ran way to small, so I ordered a size larger and it was huge!!"
I am 5'4 and 140 lbs and the medium was very large.  I am trying to return them and having a terrible time.  I would never buy these ever again.
They didn't fit well. They were tight in the chest. It's not soft cotton. They were weird in fit and texture. I never had Fruit of the Loom T-shirts like these before and I have purchased a lot of FoTL T-shirts.  I was hoping for better. I am now searching for better pocket tees
looks great but do not keep the time
Way too long in the regular length and they sit too high on the waist.
I have had 3 prior pairs of these and this iteration felt too tight. Nice looking but I returned. I switched to brooks in between and while less stylish seem to hold up better
"I saw some reviews that these run small, so I ordered a size up. It's supposed to be 14/16 which I was hoping would fit like a 10/12 in other brands but it's as small as a size 7 or 8 shirt that my child is about to outgrow. I don't know if they all run this small or if they have put the wrong size labels on some of the shirts, but I am hesitant to buy this brand again the future. It also has an odd smell that has not come out in the wash so far. The colors would be nice if it wasn't for the sizing issue."
much too tight for a medium
"I was excited in making this purchase being my friend has a similar one which I borrow from time to time. I decided to get my own. I was so excited to receive it I paid for one (1) day shipping.

My disservice began there. The order was made on the December 12, 2013 and it was delivered December 16, 2013, four (4) days later.
Secondly, on receipt of the product it did not work. I was most disappointed. So I returned it. On receipt of the returned item my account was credited within the time they said it would be done.
This has been my first disappoint and poorest service I ever gotten shopping here.

I do hope this is my first and last bad experience."
"Not what I expected; very thin ( I need to pay more attention to details), the straps are especially thin/long with no real structure."
my second pair. i have been wearing eccos for over 10 years no complaints. this is my 2nd pair of these. got these a month ago. yesterday at work realized left shoes entire opened up as stitching just game. DEFECTIVE PAIR. I don't have time to mail these back for another pair. this is a waste of time and money. won't buy these ever again. disappointed.
I returned this item. My friend with size 6.5 feet has some and loves them. I ordered my size in 9.5. They look like plastic bags for your feet in this size :/
"The word hope is hardly visible. It's not blackened in like the picture. The only way someone would know it said ""HOPE"" would be if I were to point it out. Rated two stars because It arrived on time, is comfortable and doesn't tarnish. Good, comfortable silver band."
Super cute hat but the side tassels fell off after about 1 minute of wear.  The top was still good for our purposes
"The shoes are fine as long as you don't expect them to be waterproof.  I bought them to wear to the park to play with my dog. As far as staying dry during the rain, don't count on it.  Unfortunately, these shoes do not stay dry even in a lawn that is simply wet with the morning dew.  After only a few minutes running around in the yard in the morning renders my socks all wet.  It's a great disappointment because the advertising clearly states that these shoes are waterproof.  I can't imagine that they would hold up dry in a wet trail and definitely not under rainy conditions."
"No arch support to speak of, and absolutely no help with pronation."
"I'm glad that I ordered this costume with enough time to make alternate plans!
- The ""One Size"" is for guys 200-pounds or less (I'm 210 and while the material stretches - it looks stupid).
- My favorite part, the V-shaped bib, doesn't exist.  The costume has a standard white collar that extends ONLY IN THE FRONT, from shoulder to shoulder (so it literally stops abruptly at the top of the shoulder and is CLEARLY visible.
- The top/back is split open and is supposed to tie with white strings but the part where the material splits isn't sewn so it tears incredibly easy.
- The material is ULTRA ULTRA thin.
- The inflatable belly won't extend beyond a size 36 waist.
- The white gloves are ridiculously small (wouldn't fit a girl's hand, much less a man's hand).

Sorry to be the barer of bad news, as I know that this looks like a cool costume!  I wound up going with the ""Adult Holy Sister Nun Costume Plus Size"" (meant for a woman size 16) from Party City and just got creative with it..."
again ankle issue too large and it doesnt fit your foot properly alot of spaces where there shouldnt be none.
"These are not capris! These are tights. I am 5'7"" and the go to my ankle. Much too hot for Oklahoma summer."
Terrible fabric for the price.
"deceptive ad, hence the one star, top is not leather, it stretches fast and doesn't hold the foot as well as the real leather ones The rest is the same and comfort is on par, but won't last as long as the leather one."
"If these were $20 slippers I'd be relatively satisfied. They are comfortable, look nice and pretty warm. However the fleece is coming out in chunks, so I don't foresee them lasting very long at all. I expected much better quality for the price and so should you!"
"I had to return this jacket. It was small for the size, even for junior's sizing. Also the material comes across as kind of cheap. it's doable, but you definitely are getting what you pay for."
Way too small!  I couldn't even button it on my 5 year old and I ordered size 6.  Sending back.
A bit to big.
They were way too big!  Especially in the legs.  I was swimming in then.  Fit ok in the waist.  But wasn't flattering! Had to return.
"Daughter used it once, ripped open the first day of school.  Returned!!!"
"Cute, but fell apart after being washed once."
"Boots are extremely narrow! EE probably runs normal width but extremely tight, had to return. Snaps on top of side zipper are misaligned. Can't snap closed to secure. Rocky usually does a great job but there are just too many flaws in this boot"
"Believe the reviews - this is not a wide shoe. And it is heavy.  I am a Personal Trainer and runner.  I am on my feet no less than 8 hours a day between working and my own work outs.  I had bunion revision surgery in March on my left foot (bone was cut, moved, plated and screwed in, and the soft tissue shaved off that creates the hideoous lump on the side of the foot).  My foot is almost straight, but still a little swollen so a wide shoe is my best bet.  But not these.  Measured width wise against an old pair of Asics Nimbus, the Ariel is a half inch more narrow.  And my baby toe hit right against a seam.  I made it through an hour and then took the shoes off and wore the old ones to the gym.  This shoe is available in a double EE and while I could have tried it, I ordered the Mizuno Women's Wave Rider 19 at the same time and it seems to be a good fit.  The Ariel did not feel particularly good on my right foot either.  For what it's worth, the new Asics Nimbus 18 is also cut more narrow in the D (I had worn this style for years).  I will review the Mizuno separately."
"Instead of spending a decent amount on a new express suit coat, I decided to give a lesser expensive coat a try, because my thoughts were how different could it be? Unfortunately, I got what I paid for. The jacket arrived wrinkled and when I tried it on you could hear the crinkling from the material on the inside of the jacket whenever I moved. There is no way I could wear this to the office. If you're looking for something for casual wear, this would work for you, but if you're looking for a professional and polished look, keep looking. I normally wear an xs and ordered a small and it was fitted so it runs small. I sent this item back."
"Hated it.. The gel inside the bra feels horrible!  Sent back right away, it is pretty on and works great but I could not wear it longer than 5 min..."
"This isn't even really a sweat shirt. it's a long sleeve tshirt shaped like a sweatshirt and the sizing in way off! I wear a small/med and ordered the extra large, it was skin tight. Too bad, it is a cute design."
I ordered 2 white 1 black the same so I thought but the black one was totally different not the same in any way
"Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money at the mall. These socks were extremely thin and not the soft cotton feel you would expect. Also, not much stretch. They were in the garbage after just a few uses (hole in the heel). Junk! As they say... You get what you pay for. If you just need a cheap pair of socks for a costume these will do..."
Purchased these towards the end of the winter last year so only wore them couple months.  They are nice looking and comfortable and fir true to size. I bought because I tried them on at the store and they fit me around the calf with the buckles on top loosed and with my jeans tucked in but still have a bit of a struggle to zip. They are now all sagging at the ankles stretched out and look like crap so now I don't want them anymore but since I spent all that money on them I am going to wear as a boot just to go do errands and running around in bad weather.  Will get something else to keep nice when I dress up for work or out on the town.
"too small, I wanted it to fit like a tee, but it fit more like a tight rash guard...nice quality, but would have to get a larger size."
"Sadly, I had to return them as they were too big.  I usually wear a 10 or 12 in pants or jeans but these were too big."
Very cute but I wish these felt tighter on the head. They slip off so easily...
"I accidently ordered the wrong style.  I needed the 550 but ordered the 505, which are a little tighter in the leg."
The hat didn't even survive the mail. It was broken when I got. The top of the hat broke off from the base.  Doesnt even deserve a star
Great quality but runs very large.
"This nightgown, while pretty, has some drawbacks for me.  The gown had constant static despite several sprays with static guard, it was very thin and the embossing around the neck was stiff and bothersome while sleeping."
Its not as flowy and long as the picture makes it seem. Its boxy looking and it gets really wide at the waist.
So disappointed! I got a mismatched pair! One says bride and one says bridesmaid!!!!!!!!
Very confusing sizing. Now stuck with way mens size 10 when I wanted a size 8 in womens.
Ordered two sizes bigger and still didn't fit right. It fit more like a shirt than what is advertised. Will not order from this company again. Threw product away.
"We returned them, they were very narrow."
The pants were to small maybe one size up would fit better
Rose gold wore totally off after two weeks of wear.
Horrible fit it's just way too small and I ordered the largest size. And I only weigh 220 lb. But they're really cute lightweight I wish it fit properly.
The robe was not as nice as I expected and feels very stiff. It doesn't give like it should. Wish I could return it. Uncomfortable and I haven't used it since trying it on.
"The fit is great: snug but flattering and the fabric is fun.  However, halfway through my first day wearing them I noticed the fabric beginning to unravel at the seams.  Luckily I wore them right away so  they could still be returned!"
Sticky and pilling. Very polyester feeling.
"If you buy this, consider it a rental because it's very cheaply made. Mine worked fine for ten months and then stopped working. Even though it is still under warranty, the company has ignored my requests for warranty service. The only way to contact them is through a gmail address, and they are just ignoring my emails. I wouldn't buy anything from Diplomat again.

*Well, almost immediately after posting this (and letting Amazon know how unhappy I was with Diplomat), Amazon notified me that they are sending me a replacement on their own. This is the type of customer service that makes Amazon my favorite place to buy things."
Retuned as it fit horribly.
"This is definitely not a line dress like it states the food was for an elaborate huge bottom gown-  Think Cinderella like. Also the Velcro waist bulged out a lot. But it is true, you get what you pay for."
"Wife is 5'5"" 125lbs, put on leggings and within 60 seconds the light grey top part fell down, especially if squated down. Useless unless u want to pull up every minute"
I am about 5 feet 6 inches. This pants are right above the ankle. I think this length is too short for sweetpants. They are also bootcut and together with the length it makes them look funny.
Not happy at all...way too thin....looks nothing like the picture....I could of kept my money and bought me a real coat....but why should you care.
Way too short.  Fabric too clingy.
I have to return.
Poor quality product...very hard for small babies
"Following the advice of other reviewers, I ordered larger than I thought I'd need.  Material wasn't cotton-- it felt acrylic.  I regret already having thrown it away so I couldn't document this loose-thread-hanging, floppy, uncomfortable hoodie.  Great cut and design, shoddy execution.  NOT COTTON.

Not worthy.

Avoid, 100%.  Even if you think it'll turn out right.  Just, seriously.

FWIW I own and like other offerings from Doubjou and The Lees.  Just not this.

You've been warned."
"Fit was as expected. But will be returning as they are extremely see through. You could wear spandex underneath. My son does not want to as he feels it would ""look dumb"" He is 13."
"The shoe is comfortable and would be nice if a little effort was put into using an appropriate buckle. The buckle is awkward, very poorly made, and prevents the shoe from closing properly."
Leather is not good to wear on a hot summer day sticks to feet and Velcro rubs on top of feet and creates sore spots. Might be good if you wear socks with it.
"This shirt is terrible. The silk-screen is an iron-on transfer I could have printed at home, and you can see where they cut round it. It's just awful. It shrunk so much the first washing that my 15 year old son had to give it to my 12 year old son.  Do not buy."
"Very bad quality, is almost transparent, the picture of the product does not reflect how transparent it is. I don't recommend to buy this blazer even for the price is not a good deal."
"I bought 4 pairs of these. 3 had a rip in the crotch within 2 weeks. Since I repaired them and shored up the seams they've been fine, but it shouldn't have happened so quickly in the first place. Won't be getting these again."
This is dress came with the seam messed up and the zipper does not go up at all.
"I really liked the style of the shoe but it just ran very narrow. I ordered the wide size, but they were still too tight. Had to return them."
"These are crap.  The main problem is that even though they are ""tagless"" as far as the normal sizing information goes, they added a ""decorative"" tag at the back seam that itches the hell out of you.  I tried cutting the tags off, but they are made from a stiff material that made sharp edges that were even worse.  I ended up with holes in 2 of the pairs trying to get the tags out.  Did I mention that the tags are decorative--they just say ""Reaction"" on them.  Completely un-necessary (form over function).  Stupid fashion designers...."
Such a rough and scratchy fabric!
"The fabric is nice, it didn't roll up on me - however I'm not the best judge of this considering I wore it only once.  The seam of the shirt of the neckline is finished with a thin layer of fabric - the piping? if you will, and it ripped right off and you could see it rising above the neckline of my shirt.  Also not happy because I went by the size guide and at the end of the night I had tender sore spots around the front of my armpits/upper boobie area from my skin rubbing along the material.  The arm holes go a little too far back so it became really irritating.

You might have better luck with this since it was relatively slimming on the stomach but if you're like me, 5'7 wearing a size Large, it might not work out.

Also disappointed that I e-mailed the company for an exchange and they never got back to me."
"Way too small. Not as describe. This are kid's clothes. They put US sizes, with clear dimensions but send you clothes that don't match those information. What is point. It's not a matter of Chinese or American sizes. They don't even match the American sizes they list. And the clothe is of a power quality. And they would charge you 60% of the cost of the clothe to ship it back to them, for a mistake that is their responsibility. Also watch out because you find this same clothes under many other vendors, apparently the same vendor with different accounts."
"I never wore these shoes. They have no support at all, even less than cheap flip flops. They have a flexible sole that it too soft, and they ran very wide. I bought them for rainy days when it's too hot for rain boots, but I ended up giving them away. Also, the yellow was not as bright as in the photo. It was more of a mustard color."
This dress is horrible. It is way to tight. The thread is also loose. The white is not really white. It looks nothing like the photo. A major let down I wasted $6. I am so sorry I bought this. :( I threw the dress away.
"Size up, though be mindful that the larger you go I assume the lower the neckline will plunge. I am 5'6"" and 120 lbs and the Medium was too clingy for my liking. The material is very thin as well. I was looking for something that was fitted; this was skin-tight."
"Good product; however, the label indicates it is ""highly flammable"" and ""do not iron"". That doesn't really make sense as a ""smoking jacket"" and when it arrives wrinkled."
"I thought these would be four good, basic shirts for fall to layer under sweaters and buttoned shirts and a good bargain at that price.  Well, as the saying goes, ""If it looks too good to be true, it probably is.""  These shirts run well below size - I purchased medium and what I received would barely fit over my head, and I am not a large person.  The material is thin and very cheap feeling.  I didn't even try the shirt all the way on because of the fit and the feel of the cloth.  I returned it right away."
Stitching broke after one wear.
Somehow this black pair of jeans in exactly the same style (Levis 711 30x30) fits way smaller than the blue pair I got?  Disappointed.  Will have to return.
"I won't order another one but it's not my favorite. Perhaps a little small but this fabric also has absolutely no stretch at all so that might be part of the problem. Wore it to yoga last week and it did keep everything ""in place"" but I felt my side-to-side movement restricted at times. With large breasts, there's always a trade off between range of motion and too much motion. This bra seems to skewed towards the former. Maybe better for someone doing aerobics or running."
cute but too small for person I purchased it for. Had to return. Did not know return would be a gift certificate. Stated in email my account was refuned. It was not it was a gift certificate
"Too long for Petite, fleece is somewhat rough, and not at all soft. Warm, almost too warm. Color is nice, but not enough good about it to keep. Regret to return."
3 stones missi g. Doesn't look like sterling. Looks like stainless steel.
very weird cut and super thin
Ordered wrong size without realizing it!
Didn't live up to all the reviews for me.  Wasn't very supportive and I wear a 34 D.
"This dress is VERY short. I'm only 5' 5"" and there's no way I could even walk in this, let alone sit down. It also fits nothing like a 1920's dress; it's much too fitted."
Way too small.  :(
"I got this for Halloween this year BUT, item DOES NOT inflate at alla. Should had read the reviews before buying. Waste of money."
sleeves were puffy and the neckline was sloppy - I will not buy this shirt again
I didn't like the material.  I'm returning this item.
"These shoes were cute, but I wear a size 9 and they looked huge on my feet and an overload of glitter!!"
Really cute outfit for little girls
no padding in foot for a New Balance I was shocked not like any New Balance I have ever bought junky!!
the bra straps are to short was unable to unjust them for more length dddddd
"I was not very happy with this particular Hue product. I own several different pairs of Hue jeans and skinny. This was very thin material and on the large size. I would have returned, but I moved and I am out of the alowd time frame to return."
Some studs fell out after trial use.
"Gets uncomfortable after a few hours.  From the picture it looked like there was decent heal padding, but it's not."
"Really see through!!! Black is Not dark! Don't buy for work! Not professional. Would not even consider them jeggings. I have never looked fatter in pants. Wish I could've given these half a star, but unfortunately that is not an option."
"The first time I wore them, the largest stone and one other stone fell out of one shoe and could not be found.  Really disappointing.  But because they're so comfortable and don't rub anywhere, I choose to look trailer-trashy and wear them anyway...  The prongs that hold the stones also catch on the hem of your pants or whatever they touch.  I would not purchase these again.  There are many other sandals by this brand and others that are comfortable and don't fall apart at the first wearing.  Buy something else."
"I have a wide foot.  A 4EEEE.  These slippers were about a D width.  Made in China.  Although nicely made, I consider the manufacturer and distributor are falsely advertising their product.  I gave the slippers away.  The person likes them."
Runs about 2 sizes smaller then normal. I wear a 2x this was more like a large. Sold it to a friend that wears a large and it fit him fine.
"Quality matched price. On the cheap side so don't be surprised. I'm okay with cheap fabric but the zipper was really too cheap for me to imagine it lasting.

Size up - found it very small."
bust area didn't fit right--too low v shape and loose.  Returned the dress 6/6/2017
This one size fits all thing is BOGUS!! Do not buy it is horrible!
"I love this necklace the pendant on.the picture looks plastic but it's metal which makes it even better,  the necklace is great made but more than likely you will need to make a detention on it to make it comfortable so won't be so tight fit other than that it's beautiful"
"I ordered one more size thinking it would be large enough to fit over layers of clothing... It di ot fit even worn alone! The quality of the material is ok but the finih is not polished... It makes this coat look ""cheap"" and the color is somewhat faded... Not a bright red. Will not wear it."
"Run really small, the materials they made it  are very poor. Feels like it was made out of paper bag. Choose your size wisely."
Nothing special. Cheap hardware.
"easy to break, I bought this bracelet a few weeks ago, worn it like a week then one of the strip fell out apart, disappointed"
The slipper fit but when walking pulled foot over will be returning
"Very comfortable boots.  Wore them every day for a couple weeks and they broke in easily. Only negative is that they are made in China.  Sizing was little off, my other US made Justin boots of the same size fit better.  Update - have had these boots for 3 months now and I have to lower my rating. They still look ok, but the fit has gotten worse.  A good boot will conform to your foot, these just feel weird after continued wear.  They've stretched an flop around on my feet.  And the cheap materials smell bad too.  I don't have an issue with foot odor in any other well made boots I own.  These have a bad chemical type odor after wearing all day.  Sorry Justin, you need to rethink your off-shore boot building.  I won't be buying any more made in china junk."
I really don't like these if I did not throw out the box these would have been returned.
Boots arrived on 11/27/17.  As of 1/5/2018 the rubber on the sole has broken on the outside left foot along the crease of the rubber.  It is a 5 inch hole and the boots can not be worn anymore.  I only wore them to and from work and did not do excessive outside walking in them.  Very disappointed.  This is my 5th pair of Bearpaw boots purchased for my family and myself.
"Within a week, this boot starting breaking apart. The lace-hole liners a disintegrating. Never had such a situation with a boot before. 1st time using Bates and don't think will be buying this brand again."
Georgeous boot! But buy at LEAST 1/2 size larger! Bummer when there is no 10 1/2 or 11!!!
Returning this.  Way to small.  No way this is an XXL!  Don't like the straps that come over your bra.
"A little narrower in the toe than my other Keens, but too loose in the heel. I sent them back."
"Thought this would be the one...but the hip area was baggy.  Fit weird, returned it."
Horriable!!
Bought this things for their light weight for summer.  Light they are but unfortunately they wear like pegleg pants as the legs are straight and narrow. If you have any kind of calf muscle then you are uncomfortable wearing these things...or at least I was.  I understand some people like that birdleg look...if so these would be their cup of tea.
It is not leather. Poor quality
Turned finger green.
Not nearly as pretty in person as they look on line.
Okay socks.
Not staying up for me.  I found that if I cut my black nylon knee highs to ankle-height stays in place better than these socks.
"Clasp is too loose, so pin always opens up and I don't want it to fall off.  So I don't wear."
The front toe strap was is super stiff and rubbed like crazy. I knew I had to return it after only wearing it around the house.
"Sent the wrong size and there's an awful fish smell, I can't get rid of."
"Thought I would love these, too big around my normal size ankles, never have this problem with other shoes or boots, have to wear them with ski socks to fit comfortably!"
Ripped in the first day. IN BOTH HANDS. Absolutely disappointed with product. Just shell out $20 more for better brand.
"Very cute and eye pleasing but scratched way too much against my skin. I couldn't even wear it for a day without taking it off. It's sitting in my car, can't deal with with the scratchiness"
"Nice enough shoe, but it runs at least 1/2 size too large compared to my usual shoe size.  Be aware of that.  However, I do like it enough that I'm sending it back for a 1/2 size smaller."
"For the price, I expected something better designed with better quality materials.
It feels like cardboard with a pretty film covering. Although the surface may be durable, it cannot withstand any heavy objects resting on it. You will dent it for sure.

The half circle cut out in the drawer is not centered!! This is because the center partition on the inside of the drawer would be visible and block the opening cutout where you would stick your finger in to pull the drawer out.  All that was needed was a shorter partition in the first row.

$60 for this box is really outrageous, but unfortunately the alternatives available are in a much higher price range. I wanted to organize my watches and sunglasses neatly and out of view, so I kept it. $25 price tag would be more appropriate."
"Terrible quality and very unconfortable .
Its not made of cotton . Its very thin . Like a cheap lycra ."
the linning not soft enough - felt sharp so returned.
"Back zipper broke three months after I bought the bag, which was too late to return it.  Would give it five stars if not for that."
i ordered 71/2 -81/2  got 91/2 101/2 way to big but like the shoe just can't keep it on.
"I purchased this as a gift...upon sending it to recipient, when she opened it and took it out of the box the chain was broke at the clasp!!! I should have checked it, but was in a hurry to get it out. She has returned it to me and I am in hopes that the seller will go good to exchange it!!!!"
Nothing like pic and way way to big Got a medium shirt and it fit me like a 3x
Sucks to your body. I need some freedom of movement.
pretty pattern but fit me like a maternity shirt and I'm a pretty curvy gal size 12 and size D bust
"Aweful dress, cheap material, awful fit.
Too small, Walmart has better quality,
Don't waste your time or money!'"
"At first I thought it was the answer to my needs.  BUT it collapses and rolls in the purse so when I try to get something out of it, I have to pull it up/straighten it up and gather stuff at the bottom that fell out of the organizer.  If a metal piece could be added to stiffen the sides to keep from collapsing it may be better.  too much money for an ill working item..."
"Too small
It didn't fit my daughter!!"
Returned these they were scratchy and fit small
"Upon washing, the shirt was wider than it was long.  Should have gotten a size smaller."
"This top is gorgeous, but it didn't stay that way. After one time washing it, before I even got to wear it, (I always wash new clothes before wearing) it looked terrible. There were little elastic strings sticking out everywhere, to the point that it almost looked furry! I was so disappointed, especially for the cost. Sizing did run small, and it was shorter than I prefer (I'm long through the torso)"
"Good looking watch, big but uncomfortable--crown digs into my hand and a couple splashes and it stopped working!  Description says water resistant but it's not, it's quite cheaply made."
"These are HUGE, even with thick hiking socks.  I am a solid size 6 in almost every brand and I am swimming in these.  The heel fits very strangely and there is a lot of heel lift when walking, which I imagine will lead to lots of blisters.  I returned one pair, but am stuck with another pair that I bought for my daughter for summer camp around Christmas time and didn't think to have her try until now (too late to return them).  They are quickly becoming door stops as I have absolutely no use for them."
Shoes are fake DO NOT PURCHASE. I returned them immediately after receiving it and I'm waiting for a refund. Wish I could give it a negative 1.!
The top of the hat was broke which was disappointing because it's a beautiful hat
Came apart at the toes and has a big flap now. Very disappointed.
"This Item runs about 2 sizes too small.  I am a 36-28-38.  I tried a M and it was way too small.  I got the XXL and they fit.  Just got them for the 4th to be fun.  Not expecting much out of them.  I did contact the seller and they did give me half off the reorder, which was a great customer service and welcomed."
"They are not as nice and comfy as the ""Keepsakes"" as they didn't have my size. Comfort they are uncomfortable in the toe box after a couple days of wear. I couldn't  through the return process since i washed them after a quick slip on instead of a walk  around the house. No I would not recommend these slippers. No. I want my Keepsakes back."
"Love the fabric and the dress but too small. Gave it away.  I ordered XX Large, I wear size large."
Was not  an exact size fit for what I wanted.  My size ran a little to small.
It was to small but my niece like it.
"They broke after just a few times of wearing them. Other than breaking so quickly after light (not daily) use, they are lovely."
For little girls not grown women
"This product is the worst quality product I've gotten from amazon. The color is wrong, the shape makes no sense, I don't understand it one bit. It ended up in the trash."
"The navy version is small by a size and narrow.  8B may need 9 C.  The grey blue is true to size.

Beware....."
If you're as tiny as me 5'0 and 105 lbs.. it will be too big. I got the teen size but I had to get it altered. Even after altering the sleeves were SOOOOOO puffy. Did not like at all.
"Looks cute, & I like the sole.  Fluffy & cozy inside, but I didn't feel secure in them."
Too small. Pinches in the toes. The leather is super tough and was more like cardboard than leather.  Returning this product.
way to big : (
"When I first received it, it was awesome! And then the pocket ripped...which is odd because I don't use my pockets. Everything sticks to it as well. So wash it alone and make sure you have a lint roller handy."
"THESE STUPID UNDERSHIRTS SHRINK!!!!

Need I say more?

I wore them ONCE straight out of the package and after ONE WASH they shrank! I can barely tuck them into my trousers and I'm only 5'11""! Absurd! What terrible quality control! Didn't they test these at all before putting them on sale?! This is a disgrace and I will never buy Hanes undershirts again.

SAVE YOUR MONEY! LOOK ELSEWHERE!"
"Update:  After wearing this since Christmas,  four months, the silver coating has all chipped off and it looks horrid.  I'll have to toss it.  This makes me sad and angry.
 Loved this.  Met my daughter after Christmas ( we live several states away) kept one gave her the other."
"I bought these in a size 4 (I'm usually a size 2, or 27-28) and I cannot fit them above my knees. I'm 5'1"" and 140lbs (so, short & very hippy - defined waist & curves). If you're built more narrowly than I, these would probably fit perfectly. However, I was disappointed that a large size wouldn't even fit over my knees. If you have hips, I would stay away from these jeans."
I wasn't a big fan. They looked super cheap and the calf part of the boot was WAY too big.
Vision was weird.
Entirely too large. Guess I'm smaller around then I thought. Also the padding was heavier then I think it should have been.
"I've usually been happy with hard tail products but this time i had a problem with these leggings because they were listed as ""ankle-legging"" and the ones i got were 'capri length leggings, so what i received was not what was described. They were a little too large but that was less of a problem than getting capri vs ankle length."
Wayyyy to small compared to sizing information
construction and material feel cheap.
"I have not worn these shoes.  The color is not what I wanted.  It advertised orange but, it more of a coral color"
Had to return them because they were too small.
"As I went to put the earrings on for the first time, a post came out of the clay when I removed the back!  I didn't even get to wear them once! "
"Extremely thin fabric.  After washing, the fabric doesn't resemble cloth.  It is more like a stiff papery substance that is not soft or absorbent at all.  Colors are good."
Too stiff and bulky for LO.  Had to get something less heavy until he's older maybe.
This onesie came with the stitching missing from most of the tail.  I had to sew it myself as my kid opened it and noticed it right out of the packaging. Low quality!
I bought red but this is not a red watch. It is pale pink. I guess the color was sun bleached before they shipped it to me. It looks all around pink pink pink though. Not a true red piece to the watch. It gets one extra star because the design and craftsmanship is eye catching for a plastic watch. I can see myself wearing it because I put money down and also to remind myself that puma is a wannabe brand that's let me down more than once.
Tunnels are too short and the o-rings are hair thin and worthless
Nice if you like junk
"I wanted to love this bag but the black version's stitches on the side popped after a month or so of use.

I loved it so much I actually ordered the brown, which is a different material. That one has held up way better and is the same style I can't quite seem to find anywhere else. Be wary of the black, I suppose. Maybe I just had bad luck."
No fly on these! Back to the store
Way too huge.  Basically just a piece of fabric with no shape.  The quality is awful with strings hanging off the edges and uneven hems.
it wasn't the right fit for me
Never got this ring and I am very upest it was supposed to be an engagemnt ring and I have not got it
"These are cheap thin and flimsy socks that no hard working man should wear unless they would like blisters on the bottom of there feet. As a female, these socks should be something we wear with our flats or slip on tennis shoes not men's boots or tennis shoes."
This 'costume' mimics a terrible crime. I implore you to look at how pimps traffick women and rape them before thinking this is a 'fun idea or costume.'
"My son and i liked this watch, but its not a year yet and the watch doesnt work, its not the battery and i don know if it was even worth it, very dissapointed"
"The material was cheap, like a cotton shirt.  Not rayon at all."
"The bottom was way too large. The bottom stripped part had a huge gap! Too was doable. But the suit lacked the ""pow"" I was looking for!"
I should have read the reviews prior. It looks nice from the outside but it sucks that it doesn't close.
this product came torn. was large on me. i never ended up wearing them...forgot to return them
Very thin material. Very poorly stitched seams. No mesh inside. loose threads everywhere
It's a bit on a hard side and the molding is not what I expected
"These are adorable shoes. I ordered size 8.5 wide, and they do not fit. I had to give them away. I had a few people with normal sized feet try them on, and they all said that there is no way these are wide width."
"I was looking forward to this jacket because I own several Levi's jean jackets and dig the style, comfort and quality.  However, it seems that Levi's is off the mark here.  The sizing is not adhering to the standard sizing charts.  I have tried on a couple of these, one in the store, and the one Amazon sent me.  I wear an XL in every shirt, sweat shirt, sweater and jacket I own.  In fact, XL is a bit roomy on me, which is how I like my clothes to fit.  I am a true XL with an athletic build, and I could not even button the bottom button on this jacket....are you kidding me?  This jacket is made for skinny boys and girly men with stick figures.  It is made for the twiggies of the world.  You should order a full size larger, and even two sizes larger if you want a bit of room.  In addition, it is not LONG enough.  When I raised my arms, the jacket climbs well above my umbilicus.

The positives of this jacket are that it has a nice inside pocket, the jean material is in the Levi's tradition, and the style is classic.

The Sherpa on the inside is not white, but a blue, grey color.  They should wash the jean jacket before they stitch the Sherpa to it so that the Sherpa maintains its cream color.

I am giving this jacket one star because if you receive it and can not wear it, you have to send it back.  A big waste of time! Amazon does not carry a XXL, so, this was a big waste of time.  Worse yet, if you by it for a gift, the person would receive it and would not be able to wear it, what a big disappointment and, again, a waste of time.  Amazon should advise manufactures to adhere to standard sizing charts.

Try the XL from LL Bean.  They make a Sherpa that runs true to size.

JacK Vega$"
I actually have returned these because they were to small.  I unfortunately am giving up on Skechers shoes because I cannot find a pair that fits right or is comfortable for me.  My favorite and most comfortable Skechers shoe was the GoWalk 2 which they discontinued unfortunately.  Every since then I have tried at least half a dozen different styles and nothing comes close to the GoWalk 2 :-(
"I thought the color was creme but it looked more grey when I saw it in person.  I was disappointed, but the purse is well made.  Also it stunk of plastic chemicals and I had to air it out for several days."
"Admittedly, I love Nine West.  I wanted to like this bag.  But it has such a flat shape, that even a lip balm or small set of keys makes it awkward and bulky.  Also, it's a cross body, but as soon as you open the front clasp, the whole thing just opens right up! Like, falls down and open.  Really weird.  And there are two zippered compartments, but regardless of what you put into it, and which pocket you put it into, it just makes it bulky.  If you plan on carrying anything more than flat cards and cash bills, this is not the bag for you."
"These gliders do not work on my carpet, I did much better barefoot.  I  guess some people could find some use for them but not me."
Not what I was expecting. Material is not cotton. Will be returning. No stars.
"In the picture it looks like a slim jacket, but it's to small and the material very thing"
"The very top region is tight, making them uncomfortable.  I have slightly larger calves, so they fit but feel too tight and they are NOT adjustable as that buckle implies!"
Size issue
purchased kids converse size 3 received adult male size 3
I washed it 5 times to get the odor is stll there but not as strong so at least my daughter will wear it now
I loved this but then a corner tore :( I wish I would of got a size smaller to
I wear a medium in Victoria Secret's underwear; ordered an XL and they're still too small. Wore once and threw away--wasn't worth my time to return. Don't recommend.
"I was disappointed in the quality of these socks. After one wearing, the elasticity was poor. They were falling down around my ankles. I am accustomed to high quality products from Gold Toe, and I am dissatisfied with these. I would not recommend them."
"The product selected completely different website, and have not been able to claim much less make a change. The completely different color to the selected product on the website"
"Decent quality, but it just flares out on the sides and I don't like it. I gave it to my son and ordered another brand. I also didn't like how dark the mesh portion is. For a desert hat, they should have used desert tan mesh instead of dark brown."
"I did not get the ivory bow pictured. Mine is a much more yellow ivory, and it has 3 smaller ""loops"" on each side of the center knot, vs. the one big loop on either side in the listing picture. Very thin, floppy material. Not cute at all! Save your money, & get a much cuter one from etsy!"
"This wallet was kinda big to fit on pants pockets, and my boyfriend didn't like i - so I had to return it. Good quality product though."
My baby had them off within 10 minutes. But they're otherwise wearable so I'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1.
I ordered the larger of my 2 normal sizes because I wanted it to be oversized and went by the size chart. I am wearing it today and it is tight on the shoulders and stomach.
"Super cheap looking (I know, the price is cheap, so what did I expect) and runs small.  Had to return asap!"
"XL is actually a 10 or 12. Be warned. Otherwise the look is nice. Great for tall gals with long arms. Thats a good thing. They should increase sizing so not a waste of time, hope, shipping and money."
I still haven't worn it. I'm giving mine away to a friend with a 24 inch waist.
"I returned both the ones I'd ordered. The fit was funny, stitching uneven, and neither looked like it would hold up to more than a couple of washings. A pity because they look great in the pictures. Maybe they'd fit better on a tall, lanky person, I don't know."
"Had high hopes from the reviews, but these things just killed my feet.  I tried multiple work days hoping they just needed to break in, but after a week straight, I couldn't take it anymore.  Went back to Redwings Athletic Safety sneakers."
Very cheap and stretchy material. I didn't find it flattering and sent it back.
"Very sharp looking, nice fabric, but did not fit like previous boat deck style Crocs, so I have returned them."
"The costume arrived w/out the wig. The jumpsuit was decent quality however that was overshadowed by the half missing collar. The ""proton pack"" is a JOKE!!! It stunk horribly of chemicals, the velco didn't even slightly attach the gun to the pack, the straps were the goofiest most awkward things I've ever encountered. Even tightened down as far as they would go, they were still too long, wouldn't stay secured and constantly slipped off the shoulders. The pack also will not stay inflated."
I couldn't wear
it was small
"It held fast on the way there, but coming back was another matter, air kept seeping in, I most have tried more than a dozen times so in the trash it went."
"This shirt was too big.  It is more of a jacket than a shirt, but it is even too big to be used as a jacket.  I had to return it."
"Sometimes I forget we now get most of our stuff here in the US from Asian countries. I missed the fine print that says ""for girls under 5'4"" and 125 pounds"" What??? How many people are those going to fit? Make sure to read the fine print."
transpareb=nt.. had to return :(
They are not durable.  You can find better in Walmart for cheaper.
very stiff and uncomfortable. impossible to return still trying to return them. with no success. would not recommend this product
My daughter wears a size 11 in women's and these shoes were too small. Her toes were squished up at the top. The color was cute but unfortunately we had to return them.
"Not comfy because too small, but do not look comfy."
I wish I had ordered a size smaller than I normally wear.  It is a comfortable shoe but too large even with thick socks!
"These shoes are cute, and the front strap surprisingly fits my toes well (I have narrow feet and most of straps out there are way too loose). However, the ankle strap and back piece hurt terribly. I can't stand to stay in them for more than 15'. Glad Amazon has free returns on them."
"They're going back.  My foot measures a 6.5, but I have wide feet and and high arch.  So I ordered 7.5 C/D width and can barely get my foot in the shoe. The toe box is also very small.  I like my toes completely covered.  They look a little cheap also."
"bought these sandals coz i assumed that since they were ""orthotics"" they would be comfortable to use. i found that the arch part was too high for my feet so it feels like all my weight centers on my arches. i thought that the heel portion would be a bit higher too (at least have a slight incline but it doesn't feel like it has any at all). i wore them walking around for an afternoon and couldn't wear them again the next day (my foot hurt). would have to wait a few days before i can use them again. all in all i expected more from these. i think a pair of merrells or my privos are a better deal."
"These are listed as 2E, but fit more like a narrow width.  I bought these for my husband and he could barely squeeze his foot in the shoe.  I have regular - slightly wide feet.  I tried one shoe on and it was snug on my foot.  My feet are significantly narrower than my husband's.  Believe the reviews and buy these only if your feet are on the narrow side.  Note, nowhere on the box or in the shoe's label is there any indication that these are wide shoes.  I should add the length is correct."
"I ordered size 7.5. I got right foot 7.5 but the left one is 8.5... I'm so unhappy, not satisfied at all!"
It's not for kids. It's for teens.
these run entirely too small
I don't have a big head (size s/m in fitted hats) and these things are comically tight on my head. I don't know who they are marketed for but they aren't very good. I bought the purple tinted to help while golfing (purple lenses tone down all the green on the course) but they didn't do a great job because they are barely colored at all. I ended up just biting the bullet and buying a pair of Oakleys that were specifically designed for golf use. Don't waste your money.
This is a bad product...this skirt is badly made and material is bad
"Not us sizing, this are defiantly made for a tiny person, or maybe a 10 year old."
"I was expecting more significant arch support from these shoes. The arch support provided is similar to adding a thin orthotic to a regular shoe, nothing more.

Updated 3/2016:
I bought these shoes a little over a year ago and they have completely fallen apart. I have $20 shoes from Payless that have lasted far longer with similar amounts of wear. Combined with the less than stellar arch support I cannot say I will ever purchase another pair of Vionic shoes, and certainly not at retail price."
The extra large is equal to a small
"I don't like the way it looks on me.  I am big busted and the blouse is really pretty but it makes me look like a black pumpkin.  I tried to return it, but waited too long.  I will give it to my daughter if she likes it or one of those young skinny girls (lovely) I work with.  The fit is somewhat small, but I could wear it if I liked it."
see-through.
The cover is excellent. The flap inside was too small so I had to use the one from my old wallet which I needed to replace because it was falling apart.
"Broke in half  first time I wore it, and I can't return it cuz my husband bought it in September for s Christmas gift. Don't buy- waste of money"
wouldn't stay on
"REturning this.  I had purchased several fine knitted scarfs of this style in stores... and thought that is what this would be.  No way.  it is a fairly inexpensive rayon type material, and just looks cheaply made to me.  Also far more HOT pink that deep pink!"
I order an XL and it was too small and material is hard but at least it was not thin! If it fit I would have kept it!
The quality of the dress is nice but I am disappointed because of the time spent in ensuring the correct measurement was taken yet it was still too small.
"This top runs very small. I'm usually a xs or s, but I thought I'd get a medium to give me a little time to wear it. Nope. Wore it once and folks were telling me it's already too small.  Yet I'm wearing other normal tops in mediums... Get 2x bigger than you think. Otherwise it's cute. But if I can't wear it, what's the point...?"
Don't waste your time on this shoe. After only 7 miles it caused under my toe nails on the big toes to turn purple! PAINFUL! I should have read the other reviews. The concept is really good and other than that (I am going to lose the nails for sure) I would have kept them. I hope their money back guarantee is good. So far have been on hold for 45 minutes.......  :-(
"Not good quality, when I put them on I see little elastic bands all over them."
Bag looks great when you get it . but eventually just falls apart.
Very small. I'm 5.3 and 165lb. I ordered extra lg and the item was more like a US small size! and short! Very disappointed!
"I have been wearing this style of New Balance shoes for many years.  The shoes that were recently delivered were too short, and the quality of the composition of the shoe has definitely been downgraded.  The shoes were flimsy and did not offer the support I have been used to in the past.  I returned the shoes, and am very disappointed.  What has happened to New Balance?  Their shoes used to be the ultimate in athletic footwear."
This shirt almost has a turtle neck on it. Fits me like a poncho.
"THEY NEED TO SHOW YOU THE BACK OF THIS SHIRT, SO YOU KNOW THERE IS A BIG OPENING ON THE BACK!!! I WILL HAVE TO USE THIS AS A PAJAMA SHIRT! NOT HAPPY!
PLEASE PUT A PICTURE OF THE BACK OF THE SHIRT SO PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF THIS FACT!"
I really liked this shirt until I washed it the second time and all the gold dots fell off.
"Everything is overall way too short and small. My 11 y/0 is on the small side and this shirt doesn't look long enough to cover her torso. It looks like it would shrink more in the wash as well. Sending back.

Update: I tried this for my 9 year old before returning and it was too short/small on her too!"
Thin material and bad fit.
Just wanted to make note that none of the these reviews are for this specific NAVAJO PRINT jacket.
"The color of the jeans is a muskier & darker blue than what is see in the picture. I did not like the color received. What bothered me more is the size of the leg barrel - The width is 9inches which is very large. I was expecting an 8 inch leg width at he bottom.
This information was of course not on the specifications so the fault an risk of ordering the item was my own. I think this is a last time i will ever buy a pair of CK's without trying on a fitting in store."
Too small. I have a normal sized head. Never had a problem with any hat before but this one was entirely too small.
GOT THE WRONG SIZE 7 TO SMALL NEED A 7 1/2 SENT IT BACK ALREADY WILL BUY A 7 1/2 AFTER I GET MY REFUND
"Looks nice, but can't fit a lot in it. Smaller than a traditional backpack. Very narrow inside. Tight fit for a school binder."
"Naturalizer once again is not changing the footbed for wide widths, just the strap lengths.  When molding up the sides,foot beds need to widen so those angled upward edges don't press and cut into the bottom of your foot, but rather curve along the edges of your foot.  Instead of a supportive sole, which mind you has zero arch support, they are torture devices, which I encountered on my last full priced pair.  These are comfortable for about 5 minutes until you walk any amount and feel the soreness happen.  Also, advertising shoes as ""all leather"" which they do as a brand as a whole is incorrect if you line the straps in plastic that can sweat, which isn't only unpleasantly uncomfortable, but then creates friction for a blister to form.  Leather lining is the way to go, for all places that touch the skin (which Clarks seems to understand on the Un-structured lines at least).  I will be donating these.  UNwearable.  Rockport, you do the same thing on 9+ and for wides too.  I'd rather pay more to have a shoe made for an actual foot, not just look good in a box."
The pants were too small and are getting sent back.
"pretty sure this wouldn't fit my 12 year old, way too small."
Very big and long.  Other vendors sell this style in JUNIORS sizing which I would suggest if you are 38C-D.
"Don't like these shoes-the fit was WAY off and the picture led me to believe they had a ""rough out"" finish. Am returning them."
I ordered this and received it today.  The first zipper I tried to zip fell right off the end.  It was not stitched closed.  This is really inexcusable poor quality.  I will return it immediately.
"I read the reviews and thought, they can't be that bad. Well I should have listened. The fabric is nice, however the zippers get caught and you have to back track a lot, and the pull bars don't come out on all of them. this company sent the product with no invoice and no return label. These suit cases are only used for overnight trips now and will never see the inside of an airplane. I will never buy form this company again."
The top of this sandal cut into the front of my ankle. Adjusting the buckle didn't help. Just wrong cut of shoe for shape of my feet.
"I love those shoes, I've buying a lot of pairs. But this last write pair of shoes came with defects. I'm very disappointed about that."
I found this sweater to be a bit expensive for the quality.  It didn't fit well - much larger than expected given the other comments.  I have kept it to wear for a future pregnancy - it's that big.  I ordered the M/L because I am typically a medium and sometimes a large depending sleeve length.  I swim in this sweater.  It's not flattering but comfy.
"I found it to be extremely difficult to deal with the returns dept., in as much as they seem to have an attitude that the're
customer is not always right. This is a concrete foundation in any and all businesses. THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT!!!!!!!"
"This was a huge disappointment! I ordered this watch as an upgrade for my $25 Ironman because I assumed that the extra features would be beneficial. I was wrong, the whole piece slides around inside the watch casing sometimes making the mode or stop button stick. I was better off with my trusty 6 year old 30 lap ironman watch."
I ordered in 10.5 because that is what I normally wear in Merrill. I even have a pair in a different color and love em. But the 10.5 in black was way too small so exchanged for 11. Whisk are huge and make my feet hurt all over especially my heels. I wish I could return these also but I have worn them to work twice already. Which I regret in more than one level they are painful!
Fell apart in less than a year
"32.5 inch inseam. Size chart said 30.5. I can't wear these, they are too long and look sloppy and will drag u der my shoes. It is annoying. I don't putchase new work pants often. I strayed from my usual and regret it, I would have spent a little more but would have had pants I could actually wear, soft pants. I can't hem, no seam stress in my small town, I guess I will see if anyone at work needs them."
Cute but laughably too small. No way i can ever wear these.
"I was surprised at good this looked and felt for a gold plated piece of jewelry. I've only had it for a couple of weeks and have not taken it off. So far it still looks like new. The lifetime warranty sounds great but I hope not to ever have to use it.
UPDATE: Well after wearing this maybe 15 times and a couple times in the shower but always drying it, it now looks like what I paid for it. The low price hardly makes worth sending it in as warranty. Disposable after a few wears."
not my size but is a really nice crop shirt
"RETURNED IT,ARRIVED DAMAGED."
Would be perfect if the seem didn't leak. I work in NW Wyoming in negative temps and my feet stay soaked. I had the nylon version and returned it thinking it was a fluke but no the leather pair leaks the same way. At the seem connecting the upper to the upper bottom snow melts and pours in leaving me with frigid feet all day.
When I order clothing items online I always order size Medium however this fits like a small and I am unhappy with it.
Cute but entirely uncomfortable. Size also ran very big.
"They are not safe on wet grounds. This is not a comfortable shoe, makes your feet look fatter than they are."
For what ever reason these jeans developed holes in the upper legs. I would never buy again !
I really liked them before I washed one. The seaming came out in the wash the very first time and it pretty much fell apart.
"I ordered this set as a gift for my mom, and needless to say I'm returning it. It looks like little girls play jewelry. Its very small and not even close to as pretty as the picture. No way was this at one time worth $229. Its very cheap looking. It doesn't even fit comfortably around MY neck. I found another pearl set much more beautiful than this, my advice to you is look for another set like I did."
"Very cute, wore for my wedding.  Not nearly as comfy as I thought they would be.  I added clear cushions before wedding, but still ended up going barefoot or in soft flats and had blisters on my feet."
"poor quality. I think the internet look good, but the quality is bad and not that of his suela.la qu size mismatch."
"I read this same comment by other buyers and should have taken heed, but I needed the item and thought I'd be safe selecting mid-range price rather than the absolute least expensive. Not so! The turnpiece or ""handle"" broke on these in exactly the same way people describe across price ranges. Waste of money, just about the only thing I've bought from Amazon so far that was."
Very cheap material even at this cost is not acceptable. One sleeve is tighter than other. Do not buy it. Not recommended.
"I put this on as a nose ring, but to me it looked fake. I tried it several places on my lip, but the magnet inside wouldn't stay put. I probably won't ever wear this, but if I had never had my nose pierced maybe I wouldn't think it looked fake and would wear it. It did stay in place in my nose."
"Wish I could be more positive, but looks really cheap, which it was.  But had hoped for more.  Sorry."
With 6 cards and 10 bills this wallet creates quite a bulge in the pocket. I went back to my single money clip and put the cards back in my old wallet. Just not for me. Gave it to the kids.
The material wasn't what I expected
"Too small, did not like the shoe."
Top is very thin and the quality is not good. Kind of disappointed
"ordered xl when I can fit either large or lx, but could not get the sleeves over my elbow! Gave to friend that usually wears large and she couldn't button it, ok for her as over shirt.  Not sure who this will fit!!!"
"Lasted less than one year and the dividers started breaking, causing credit cards to fall out when opened."
Very soft! The color is perfect but it is very small.
Arrived squished and bent... not very nice materials.
"I purchased this bag in Fanfare, and sent it back the next day. I have several Glenna's from the years 2012-2014 and I was surprised at the quality of this bag. First of all it was priced over the full price if you buy it from the original manufacturer.  Also the bag was poorly stitched.  The two sides where there is contrasting trim did not line up. The zipper was stitched to tightly which made the bag gather on one side. The handles are also lower quality on the bag. They are very thin, scratchy material. My older Glenna's have very soft handles, not padded, but soft. The biggest problem I could not look past, and returned the bag over however, was the squeaking noise the bag made as I walked around. How ever they are attaching the handles to the bag now has caused something to rub together. None of my older bags do this. It was so loud my daughter asked me what that noise was. VB's quality is plummeting fast. Three years ago this bag was worth the $80 price tag. Today, no way."
"Little tight, but after a few washings, the fabric finally gave in."
"I ordered a 8.5 it was too small so I returned it for a size 9. I waited and when I finally got my size 9. The outside of the box said size 9 but inside the box was a size 7. Come on People.!!! This will be the 3rd time I ordered these shoes. Amazon Order Selectors ( Pay Attention, ) you might want to actually look in the Box and make sure it's the right Product. FRUSTRATING.!!! These shoes better be Worth all This."
The wrist size (I thought I was ordering a large as there were size options available) is VERY small...even for a child's wrist. It is pretty tough rubber so it doesn't snap or break easily when bending it but size definitely too small.
"they came on time and in a nice clean package and they do look sturdy when you first open them since they are double hemmed through out. But they do not have any elasticity. I put them on and they stretched to fit my legs. ( I have normal average legs) but they started to fall and I could not keep them up for anything. I was thinking they might work really well with a garter belt since there is no sticky cling on the inside of them. After having them on for about 30 minutes I got tired of fighting to keep them on and I took them off. They didn't go back to the shape they came in. They just stayed in an outline of my leg and foot. So I guess they are good for one quick wear, but I was planning on taking my kid trick or treating and this was going to be part of my costume."
"ha - expected it to be tight but not this tight
construction ok except boning already beginning to tear through material"
These shoelaces were low quality. They were wider than most kids laces and difficult to lace into children's shoes. Once laced the clips that are placed on the ends of the laces would regularly pop off.
"I was hoping to wear these to yoga and exercise classes but they are see through, especially with bending :("
I love uggs and have several pairs but for some reason these ones started curling down at the top on the button side. I only wore the for short periods and not very often and always laid them flat in the original box. I was dissapointed.
"Way to small, I ordered medium shirts they fit like extra smalls. I will have to return them."
"Had to return these shoes, as they were way too small (runs at least 1 size smaller) and very stiff, like you're wearing wooden clogs."
"I ordered 30/30 but received 28/30.....
Too bad...."
"Horrible fabric, cheap and not worth it."
"I was a loyal Levis wearer for decades. I even put up with the ""coolness tax,"" the higher price that Levis command only because of the famous brand name. Those days have passed, though.

The ""new"" 505s are made from something a lot lighter and less durable than before. It seems like only a few weeks before the back pockets blow out, forcing me to buy again. In fact, older Levis with the heavier material are in better shape than the new ones, with less wear on them. A well-known competing brand still uses the heavier cloth, so that's where I'm buying now. If Levi went back to something more rugged, I might consider buying them again - but I really don't have time or patience to go around checking all the features of all the brands. I'd rather just go to the store, buy what I know, and be done with it.

Bye-bye, Levi. We had good times together, but that's the past. I have a future to get on with.

-- wiredweird"
Very small and very ill made
Doesn't fit well... uncomfortable
Really disappointed with the quality of the material. Makes me wonder if it's real CK or an immitation of the real product. I wanted to give it to someone as a gift but had to cancel the intention coz it just looks like really cheap stuff.
Small triangular pads fall out. Reducing garmets usefulness
The product was cute and fit perfectly but i only used it two times and zipper broke.  So im not very happy
"I ordered 4 different colors and each one I swear is a different size. Very frustrating, cups fit but band on all of them is too tight I have to undo the bottom three hooks. I'm sure if I order larger the cups will be too big"
I believe I got the large and I couldn't even get it close to fitting on it me.
"Were to narrow, hurt my foot."
"Waaay smaller than expected.
\"
"I purchased the shoes for my mother and the size is bigger than she normally have with this brand.  Therefore, we have to exchange.  Furthermore, it is a little too lose even we change the size.  This style shall more close and tight fit but it does not."
"received these today, they are so small so small and they are not orange they are yellow.....very unhappy with them"
"Dont buy this boots, bought them like 4 months ago. They didn't even lasted  2  months. I used them in door and never got them wet and they crack open"
The fit is weird. I thought I had put them on backwards at  first. Then I checked an the tag was I The back. They come up really high in the front and is low in the back they are going back.
"These are so-so. Stems are quite short. Have trouble putting them in my daughters ears. The stems keep falling off.
Two pairs are bent......
I understand they are cheap, and I can see why!!"
"Shorts quality are what you would expect from Dickies. The metal button is nice. However, the zipper pockets are noisy and require 2 hands to unzip. Instead, recommend these, which I got in black: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000236TLY/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_c_api_zA2PxbS9R3QDH"
Ripped when arrived.
Run small and poor fit.
"These were purchased for my wife who averages anywhere from 20-25k steps with a fit bit a day.

Ok heres the good-
They are comfortable.
She liked the color
Were terribly expensive

The bad.
The seems and stitching were the first things to go, about a month of wearing them
Second and not far behind the glue on the sole started separating, which is kind of a big deal.
Lasted almost 4 months.

With the New Balance name and old reputation I would expect more from them and a better constructed shoe"
"This gave me serious cone boobs, I ended up sending it back"
I have trouble finding work shoes.  I have wide feet and these stretch a lot if I wear then to much.  Like squeak with every step.
very disappointed about the quality.
"These pants were WAY too tight.  They come in the size I ordered, but I have never had a pair of pant this tight.  I would have to order two times my size for these jeans to fit."
"It is not the same at the picture, it is completely other thing. Do not purchase it if you are wondering to use the same thing as the picture. I was planning to use it as a Sandy (grease) custome but, I couldnt. So sad."
"I was very disappointed in this ring. The sapphires looked so rich and dark blue on the website, but when I got the ring they were so pale and fake looking.  The ring was also a tight fit for a 7.  Most of my 7's are huge on my fingers, but had I got the size 6 (which I contemplated getting) it would never have fit.  Very disappointed in this ring.  I sent it back. The thing that angered me most was that I paid $20 some dollars to have overnite delivery, and it still came two days later........and what a waste of money to lose that money to have it shipped quickly!"
"My husband ordered me an xlarge because there were no more larges in stock.  It fits very small.  I am not a big girl but I do wear a large for my very long body, I needed an extra extra long in this"
"Great price, but size is tiny."
maybe if i has sticks for legs these would work and i'm not even that fat . - .
I was really excited when I received these matte black sunglasses. They looked nice and felt pretty well made for the low price. But that lasted only so long. The matte finish is just a thin coating over the frames. I've only had these two weeks and the matte is peeling off all around the edges. You'll regret buying these.
Very cheap looking----sent it back
Bad quality. The white paint was all over the bracelet and looked like it was cheap because it covered the gold trimming.
This is made of very thin metal. I could bend/break it easily.
Buyers be aware that this style does not have the adjustment to cinch it around your head.  The other style listed with the larger brim appears to have that feature.
I bought a pair of Levi's 501 for my son. He tried hem on as they arrived and they fit. He said they were a little stiff so we put hem in my delicate wash in the machine. When I took them out of the dryer they seemed very short and were very wrinkled. I ironed them and made my son try them on again.  They do not fit. They have SHRUNK!!!!!!!!  Too tight at the waist and too short!!!!!  I am in shock and VERY disappointed in Levi.  My husband and I only wear Levi's. Something has gone terribly wrong!!
"I have owned Danskos for many years now.  They are the only thing that keep my feet from hurting when I am on my feet all day.  These, however, ARE NOT THE ORIGINAL DANSKOS!!  For all of us Dansko lovers be advised that Dansko is no longer being made by the same people. As of 2008, Danskos are being produced in China. It was a part of a split between Sanita (the original makers of Dansko shoes) and Dansko. Dansko lost the patent to make the Sanita Clog shoe and the Chinese-made product is NOT the same.
1) They are not real leather.  I know this because of how bad my feet smell in non-leather shoes.  I'll spare you comparisons here.  They say leather upper, but it is a leather composite.  The toe box scuffs off EXCEPTIONALLY easily as well.
2) They are stapled along the base, not sewn.  This is the new way of doing things in China, but it's not even a straight staple, it's all crooked.
3) The sole is now heavy and inflexible.  The support that used to be there, just isn't.  My arches ache and my metatarsal is very sore.

They still sell older Danskos in some stores with the original spongy sole, quality leather and premium stitching.  Look for the red flower on the bottom, a square around the Dansko logo and/or a patent number on the sole.  Those will be the Dansko quality you are looking for.  Otherwise, just go with Sanitas.

I gave this two stars instead of one only because Amazon was EXCEPTIONAL in their customer service.  They allowed me to return these and I have to say, were just absolutely wonderful to deal with.  I try not to return too many things because I feel like it hampers commerce, but this was an exception because of the absolute lack of quality.  KUDOS to Amazon for their great service.  The only shining light in this horrible debacle!!!"
"Using this for a Sheik Hyrule Warriors cosplay. The fabric is opaque enough that I couldn't see my neon colored ""intimate apparel"" through it. Wearing it to a con next week, will write again on how it performs.

Update: wore the suit all day for a couple days at con and my armor wore holes in it. Also, not as opaque as I thought. If you stretch the suit enough (example bend over to fix something on your leg) then the suit is see-through. Would not recommend for any action/yoga poses but great for standing in.

Update 2: found some photos of me from the con, and this suit DOES NOT photograph well... its appeared transparent in places I wanted covered."
"I bought these as a potential replacement for some 100% cotton, short-sleeved PJs I bought years ago.  I was disappointed in these, as they were far too clingy and did not feel as comfortable as my older pair."
"I have problems with my left foot.  The right shoe fit very nicely on my right foot, but when I put the left shoe, it made my left foot hurt. Shoes look nice.  Too bad they made my left foot hurt. Sent both pairs, beige and tan, back to the company."
Attractive but so small they are hard to put on ears.  Clasp feels very weak.  Would not purchase again.
NO coverage and way too small.
The gooch area on these boxers wears out way too fast.
"I returned them. The right and the left shoes were manufactured noticeably different, and I'm not that observant nor do I typically care that much, but it was enough that I returned them. I've always found Naturalizer to be comfortable but these were stiff, narrow, and uncomfortable. I tried wearing them around the house a bit to see if they'd loosen up but after less than ten minutes I decided that I wouldn't be able to stand them long enough to see how that played out, they were just TOO uncomfortable."
The fringe was too heavy and I thought it'd be hot in summer weather. Sent these back.
"Pretty and fit well but not well made. The clasp broke a week into wearing it... one of the links just wasn't sealed and it came undone, resulting in the loss of my favorite Star of David pendant."
"Had to return these. Despite being the same stated size as my classic Crocs, this shoe is way too small. I couldn't get ether foot inside them!"
"Sticker left residue on leg.  There's no way to remove this and it ruins the pants.  This was a Father's Day gift and Amazon won't return since it's after 30 days.  Beware when you're purchasing for holidays, Amazon won't accept returns after 30 days, no matter what the problem is."
"they fit fine, but the straps are to far forward, they want to come off of you feet so they are not good to walk it, fine for house shoes but suck for outside"
"If you like light watches then this is for you. However personally the watch quality was very cheap looking to me and I was too embarrassed to give this as a gift! I wouldn't buy again... The clasp is very odd and didn't like that too, nothing i've ever seen before on a watch."
UK sizes
"Size 2E proved to be too small so I have not worn these much. They still look new. But instead of breaking them in (I hoped they would become comfortable), I just plain broke them: the sole separated from the shoe at the back after a dozen hours of wear. Glue failure. Too bad. New Balance used to be such a great brand. But the last two pairs have literally fallen apart due to faulty adhesives. ""Made in the USA"" ain't what it used to be, I guess."
I've worn size 12 for 35 years and this is the first pair of size 12 that don't fit. They look like nice shoes though.
Super cheap and too small.
I returned the sandals. I have narrow feet which require good arch support.
Very unattractive shoes. I sent them back and replaced them with the Lulu weave skinny sandals. Much better
Comfortable sandal with a big problem.  The soles wore out very quickly.  I won't buy again.
"I""ve been wanting these boots for a long time, as I need a pair for comfort, for long walks.  They look really good in the pictures, but were aweful when I put them on.  The looked cheap, like rain boots, and not like the boots that ""UGG Australia"" is famous for.  I've purchased Ugg boots in the past and they've always been a fantastic boot, size and style.

I'd think twice about getting these, as again, the calf is WAY  WAY too big.  I coulda fit 2 of my legs in one!  And its nothing to do with the labeled ""size, length, and circumference"" on the description."
way smaller than i expected.. i bought a XL for my sister but it was even too small for me (im 5' 5'' and 135 pounds) unless your tiny its not worth the money.. the materiel was nice.. but way to small... maybe good for teenagers who are small..
"I purchased these and they look great and are cute.  I did not realize they are more like house shoes, because they can not get wet.  I kept them though and will use them for house shoes."
"TERRIBLE DO NOT ORDER. Used this kit to resize my husband's watch. Two of the tools broke IN the pin holes and we had to use another tool to try and get THAT one out, which then promptly broke as well. Cheap tools, terrible quality. I bought the watch as a gift for my husband, and since it wasn't a cheap watch, we should have just taken it somewhere. But we figured buying tools would save us time and money. Now the watch has been slightly damaged because of the tools. I seriously regret buying this tool set. If you hate your enemy, buy him this resizing tool kit."
"This boot runs way too small. I wear a solid 7 in women's shoes. I decided to order up a half size to add a little room for jeans and socks for the colder months, and these boots still didn't fit. I had to squeeze my foot in. They're really beautiful, but I can't believe I would have to get an 8.5 or 9 to actually get my foot in. I'm disappointed."
"Very disappointed the quality of this backpack.  After 4 short months both of the main zippers (the first zipper broke within a month) are broken.  The backpack itself is in excellent condition.  It what by my 1st grade daughter and the only thing she carried in it was her 1"" 3-ring folder and her lunch box.  For the price, I wasn't expecting the world, but I did expect it to make it through the school year."
Good idea but one zipper broke on my first outing overseas. Was able to use the other zippered pocket. Too late to return but will look for something sturdier.
"I wanted a classic and clean looking shoe. The Converse Chuck Taylor fit the look I wanted!
Unfortunately, my job requires me to stand ALL day and by 2pm my feet hurt badly when wearing these shoes. It was my 2nd pair of Chuck Taylors and I got a larger size THIS time because I thought the 1st pair was too small. WRONG! It does not matter what size-They just have NO cushion at all."
"terrible, my daughter loves turtles and she always used crocs , this one it fits like large in the sides and gave her many blisters, terrible"
As soon as I put them on the elastic busted .
Not what I expected. Doesnt look like the pic at all. Fits really weird and the material is like a tshirt
I should have gone with my gut and ordered a brand with actual sizes.
Too narrow for three year old son to put on his size 9.
"I wanted to love these! But my foot would roll inward :( I have a low arch and knock-knees, so they were just not for me."
"If you wear a 13 EEEE and think that ordering these in a 13 W will ""be just as good"", don't do it. The shoe is fine size wise for my EEEE foot, but the steel toe must be from a B width shoe? It rubbed my big toe badly, and made it almost impossible to walk.
No issue with quality of materials at all, looks great, but just not wide foot friendly. Back to Red Wing's I guess for this duck foot..."
"This is my second pair of Dr. Martens. My first pair wasn't this boot, but lasted 3 years on an aircraft carrier flight deck. That's 3 years of non-skid tearing up the bottom. Standard issue military boots usually last 6-8 months. I really liked them and couldn't find a place to re-sole them for me, so I stuffed them in a closet and bought these.

Hands down the worst boots I've ever bought. The tops on both boots have gaping holes through them because they're thin and cheap leather rubbing on the ankle pads. I've had the boots close to 6 months and they're essentially garbage. I'd steer clear of these. I'll post pictures here as well, but leather that cheap and thin is not worth your money."
"I am 5'1 and 120lbs. I ordered a medium, and it fit okay. The seam however goes right down the middle of your crotch and it makes it appear to be a camel toe. The material is cheap shiny weird stuff and I really didn't like it. I won't be wearing this anywhere, I'm sure it will find its way to the garbage or goodwill."
"I love the style, but I wear a 32ddd bra. There is no back strap or any sort of way to tighten the underwire around your torso. Imagine wearing a bra without clasping it in the back. Not supportive at all. I wore a strapless bra underneath."
I would have given these a 5 but the rubber keeps splitting open. I bought one pair in 2014 and they cracked down the middle of the top of the foot and I had to throw them out. I figured it was a fluke and I really liked the boots so later I bought another pair but they ALSO just cracked (along a seam on the foot). Long story short: if they all end up with cracks in them then they don't have much value to me as rain boots. It's a shame. UPDATE: I used special glue to fix one of the splits/cracks and ANOTHER one happened on the other boot. I give up.
weird having zippers on both sides
"I purchased the charmed as a gift, however the the lock on the end of the bracelet has turned the color bronze."
I ordered these shorts for my son and they look and feel like sandpaper. They run really large and long and will be returned soon.
"This one I did send back but I think had it not been flawed I definitely would have loved it.  I just didn't want to risk getting another one with a defect.  It's a hassle for me to return merchandise; probably because I've bought so much from Amazon.  Beside that it was from a third party and I just recently learned the rules for that!
klmosier@gmail.com"
"First I ordered the size 10.5 4E.
It was too wide and too big.

So I returned it and ordered 10 2E.
It is way too small and too narrow.

I have to return it again.

I love the quality but cannot find the right size for me.."
Does not work for what I bought it for.  Much smaller than I thought it would be.
Clingy fit and sort of itchy material. Not the best maxi dress I've purchased
will return but otherwise well made
"Almost impossible to get on, as the buckle is fixed and doesn't allow your foot to slide in without a huge fight.  Removing them is a bit easier, but mot worth it."
"Bad shoes too small and no stiffness to the back of the heel. Can't get them on heel just collapses, once you get the heel over yours take a step and it pulls off. Worthless."
What was I thinking. These shorts do not fit well at all. Baggy in the middle and tight at the bottom. It's like your butt is eating the shorts. Not cute.
Broke the same week I got it
Really bad print.  Definitely a knock off shirt. The letters are really bled over.  I never write bad reviews but this one is not great. my advise find another one
"Vivobarefoot can be narrow and ""flat"" in the toe box part. Trail Freak is an example. I own two pairs of Vivobarefoot, Evo Pure, one in blue, the other white/red lining.  I love Evo Pure, because it makes my feet look ""narrow"" while providing ample room in the toe box area. I ordered them in the same size, but Trail Freak came out narrow and uncomfortable as soon as I put them on. So sorry."
"Zipper immediately broke off. 2 of the 4 garter straps immediately snapped off. Looks good, but is extremely poorly made."
Poor quality printing on picture. Shirt worth MAYBE $5.00.
Looks good enough but you'll need to pad these to be bearable.
"Really small.  Nice enough bag, but very overpriced for the size.  I returned it."
"Too large of a fit for me, unfortunately."
The color is more pink than reflected here and they are incredibly uncomfortable. I sent them back.
"The dress is cute, but I believe it had been a return, as some of the gathered seams at the waist were pulling apart, as if someone had tried to force it on. As I bought it to wear to an event, I washed it and repaired the seams so I could wear it. It will be okay to wear around the house, but I am not going to wear it in public for fear the smocking will totally unravel!"
Very much larger than it should've been. I had to send them back because it would've been a guessing game for them to fit.
Not pleased with the quality....size is somewhat small
"I love underarmour underwear. However, this pair is not as depicted.  The images shows the legs being longer than what they actually are.  They are not briefs but they are much shorter than depicted.  They end up not fitting as well. The waist is larger and the legs are smaller so it doesn't fit well."
This shirt was way too small! I ordered a large and I'm typically a medium and it was extremely tight.
"It is the year 2015, these leather boots are built like it is 1911 and cost too much. No inner cushioning, my heel and Achilles tendon area made contact with the back portion of the boot, which look like it had cardboard material sewn on the inside are and was uncomfortable at 9.5, then at 10, it was just too long in the foot. I switched to Lugz, different style, more like a construction boot. However, Lugz brought this boot to the 21st Century, because it is a construction boot on the outside and comfortable sneaker on the inside. In the Pacific Northwest where I live, puddles and wet pavement are no problem with foot travel."
My little one was so excited to receive it and the band broke on the second day :(
It's cute but the top isn't very comfortable. It is also very thin so you can see the cups through the fabric. But you get what you pay for.
"Length is right, but painfully tight in the toes"
"The bust is way to small for this suit, and the bottoms wayyy too large."
So not what I thought they would be
It didn't fit as expected.
"I bought this for my mother and its just crap. She states that the material is crap, the sewing is crap and the feel is well, crap."
"Fit as expected for a little while - before an hour was up, these were sagging and bagging and falling down.  I'm not kidding, the crotch sagged so far down it was unbelievable, and there were wrinkles all around the knees.  But, because I paid good money for them and they're the only maternity tights I have, I wore them again.  Same: less than an hour of quality wear and then stretched out and baggy.  Additionally, after two wears and two gentle wash/air dry sessions, the elastic is all breaking and they refuse to regain their shape.  I can't recommend these. I'm ordering a pair by Spanx today, hoping for better results.  There's a lot of winter left and I am going to need something to keep my legs covered."
"I agree with the previous review about the boots being vinyl. I bought another pair of Nine West, all leather, just a few dollars more. Worst yet, these boots will not go over my legs, the shaft is too small.
The boots are so shiny, and looks very cheap."
No wire which I thought this had. That was disappointing. I bought this after reading an article about bras with really good back support. It seems like it would but it is just too tight and hard to close in the front with all the hook and eye closures. The cotton isn't very comfortable either. A very grandma type bra.
"The sandals run a bit small. That in itself wouldn't bother me too much, but they're also surprisingly flimsy. My daughter grabbed and immediately ran outside in them or I'd have returned them."
"They're a bit wide so I had to comfort or control while working out. On top of that the bottom of the shoes is cheap material, the foam type that you get when buying shoes from Marshalls or Ross.  Those ones with no grip or traction. So its terrible when working out legs or just running. DO NOT wear in rain, you will slip. I barely made it up my driveway hill"
"i got the package the customs marked cell phone case and case for recharger-  there was nothing in the package  nothing.  my post office said they broke customs law as a claim for wrong customs  on the mailer and no items in it--  don't buy from this seller--- cant be trusted .  i understand this has happened before ,  as i now saw the feed back from others.  NOT GOOD!"
"This is probably the most comfortable bra I have ever had on, but the cone look it gave is embarrassing and not wearable."
"They are darn good imitation but they are not in any way related to a cow.  Very disappointed . If the shoes were much, much cheaper and the page hadn't claimed leather it would be ok but neither of these are the case. Let the buyer beware.  Other than that shoes are cute and fit decently but are at least a half size small."
You can't dry them in dryer which I found not convenient. .. but they work
Fit was great. Quality wasn't the usual you would expect. This is the first Lacoste item I have that degraded in a few months.
Watch was scratch had the wrong instructions couldn't set it all the way a bad choice
"the hat was jammed into the mailbox in a paper envelope.  We can not get the wrinkles out so the hat can not be used. If you have any
suggestions on how to get all the wrinkles out I would appreciate knowing.  Next step will be throw it in trash and make a note of the sellers
name."
"It was okay. Perfect size, perfect color. Like I said, it was okay...until one of the buckles broke within two weeks. Now it's useless."
These are pretty non outstanding as far as fluffy boot covers go. I ended up going for another pair of white sparkles I found on a different website. These were kind of limp dumb looking
Returning them. The first time I wore them the post bent away from the crystal.
"Surprised by this one. I've ordered four dresses from ACEVOG, and three of them were spot on for sizing. I went up a size on this one after reading the reviews, and the shoulders were still too tight. I felt like I would pop the little button closer open. It was very pretty, but had to send it back."
"I still have them in a bag,I waited  to long to send them back,I order a size 8 womens and I have a wide foot,they fit like a mens size."
"Fabric is soft.  Suit is nice and long.  My complaint is the neck is so loose, like it was stretched out by an adult's head.  Disappointing since it is hard to find bodysuits long enough for my 20 month old."
Makes tiny air fart noises with every step! I return them after one where cuz I couldn't stand it anymore. Luckily the seller was very accommodating im processing the return
way too big and not the same color as pictured it was orange.  Cheaply made I won't use this company again.
SMALL!  These run about 2 sizes smaller I think. Considering there is NO tag in them and they look like they have been worn! So for $30 I think I will stick with buying jeans and pajamas separately
"Even though it comes with spacers to make this key holder wide, it becomes bulky & cumbersome adding more than 4-5 keys."
"Loved the fit & style of this dress. Unfortunately mine came with a hole (about 6 inches) in one of the seams. Because I need this dress for a wedding in a few days, I will not return it for another one. I will try to mend it & make due. I wish this dress had been made more sturdy or something. No way should it have a hole in it, brand new! Very disappointing."
These stud earrings came without backs. I was very disappointed in quality. You get what you pay for. These were cheap.
"Arrived on time, and looks like the picture. But the basket was broken upon arrival. I like that the dog comes out of the basket. But it's pretty poor quality."
"The belt was mediocre, the inside part of it would scratch against my work pants because it wasn't smooth."
Not very sturdy at all.  The leather strap entwined with the chain carrying handle popped after carrying the purse only once.  I also noticed that the white upper portion of the purse started to take on a pinkish hue.. no idea what that is about...
"First off, the fabric is thin...VERY thin. The mfr. calls the fabric 100% cotton. I call it 100% threadbare.
Second and finally, the fit is tight. Not so tight to be unwearable, but tight enough to be a disappointment.
What really bothered me were the legholes. They were way tight and way uncomfortable.
That's my story and I'm sticking to it.

By the way, I see in this product listing that Amazon sells these both new and used. Used underwear? Really??"
tarnished in days
"1st, for some reason I doubled ordered the sweater by mistake...how?  I`m not sure.  I noticed it only about an hour after I ordered it but was too late to stop the 2nd order. I read the previous reviews and purchased the size larger as most reviews stated that the sweater fit small.  When I tried it on it the fit was nice from the waste up but the length went all the way past my waste half way to my knees. Now, I`m sending both back and paying shipping on both.  Not happy with the sweater, the seller or Amazon."
"Not worth it!
Bad quality."
I received the wrong size!
My legs are skinny and its too big on my calf....keeps falling down..
The soles are seperating after having less than 2 months with minimal wear
My first try to wear these lovely shoes - unfortunately they were way to small across the toe box for me and I had to send them back.
The belt strap seem like quality material and the buckle look nice - but the release does not work. Almost impossible to get it to release - which can be a great problem. I am considering returning it as defective.
Shoes were worn and dirty. Returning them!
poorly made however.
"I've had two pair of these shoes before and they were my absolute favorite. Keen took them off the market for awhile and I was ecstatic to find out they were back. However, when this pair arrived they were much smaller in the toe box area and so tight I could hardly get my foot inside the shoe. I've worn them 10 times and they still hurt my toes and haven't stretched out any. I'm super disappointed with these."
very poorly made. the stone came off in less than an hour wearing. dissapointed.
"Unfortunately this shoe was not for me. I own several Dansko clogs & couldn't wait to have these for the summer. They are too wide for my narrow feet. I loved the color, the size fits perfect, just too wide. Had to send back."
"I thought these would give/flex a bit more, but I couldn't even get my sons foot in this shoe because the top part that goes around the ankle was so tight. His twins sister wears a size smaller and she even had trouble putting them on herself. I put them on her and they seemed large once they were situated correctly... although she did wear them for 20 minutes before wanting them off, getting them on are just not worth it. Also should not my kids have a little bit wider feet, but haven't needed wide shoes as of yet.. (bought a size 5)"
"The fabric is smooth and comfortable, however, my second pair that my boyfriend ordered for me has holes. Unwearable."
Not as expected. They are too high and one of the three in the pack is way bigger than the others which does not make sense and I would not be able to wear it.
They are very lightweight with no elasticity or proper cut to stay put.  Would never work with jeans as they stretch right out and would ride up.  I can only wear them with baggy pajama pants or under a sundress....but still don't like the fit.  They will probably just stay in the drawer unused.  Disappointed to say the least as I have always purchased Fruit of the Loom panties with no complaints. :-(
"No adjustable waist, unflattering, paper thin, and not waterproof at all. Stuck my sleeve under the sink and soaked right through."
Not so great. Washes badly.
"Did not fit past my lower calf, and there was more than enough fabric it was the elastic that was super small."
Nice shirt but had a hole in seem.
"These have a nice wide toe box, but after about 75-100 miles in them (only about 3 hiking trips and a few light trail runs), they have begun to rip around the seams, tear along the side where they bend, and fall apart. They don't leave blisters and the toe box is great, but the top of the shoe is shallow and the laces are short. They don't work great with inserted custom insoles. They also get very wet and do not dry. You probably won't realize how wet your feet are until much later, but the littlest thing soaks them through."
It broke my watch the first time I used it. Be Carefull
"I rated this five stars but after wearing this well over a year I can't wear this alone, I have to have ribbons over this and even then it slips. bad quality :("
Cheap quality and they are way to small.  No stretch at all.
Mine came with eyes already out
Didn't like the Elastic in the very top. Sent them back
"I bought this dress recently....very, very thin fabric.....could only really wear it over a bathing suit. Little disappointed, have been searching for a nice brown maxi dress, this one just won't do."
"Hello

I ordered and recieved these gloves that i found to be very well made, i ordered a large by measuring my hand according to the size chart.
Being a little snug i figured the gloves would stretch as they normally would do, the right hand glove stretched to a comfortable fit, but the left hand glove is so tight my pinky finger hurts when i bend my fingers to grip something, i figured that i would continually wear them until the left hand glove was as comfortable as the right, but it still is  the same.
Both of my hands are the same size.
Since i already used them and i was expecting the left hand to stretch, i made no attempt to return them.

  Bob Henke"
"These shoes are not what I had in mind.  My fault for not reading the description. I thought they were going to be sporty linen-look canvas.  But they are super thin, pebble textured vinyl material-very cheesy and cheap looking.  It looks like something a great uncle should be wearing, not a hip young woman.  They are very, very comfortable, though...fitting much like crocs.  ultra lightweight plastic."
"The design of these shorts is baffling. The are WAY too small in the waist but with giant pant legs. Literally every single pair of shorts my husband owns is a size 38. We ordered the 38 and couldn't even button the pants - not even close. So we returned them and went up two sizes, two a 42. He could then button the shorts, but the legs of the shorts were absolutely gigantic.  My husband generally likes things to be looser fitting but it was ridiculous, and looked ridiculous. Needless to say, we were thankful for Amazon's return policy."
Bought this as a Birthday gift and I know for a fact that I'd ordered this in black. When it arrived the shirt was in a metal grey color. So beware that probably you won't get the black. Should had listen to the other comments. Whose ever in charged of sending these shirts out shouldn't be doing this in the dark...get your colors correct please..lucky my buddy love the show...
Very cheap looking lace.  It's okay in a pinch but not pretty or elegant.
"I buy a lot of things online that have Asian sizing, but this item is so tiny, I can't even get into it.  The garment itself is very thin material and if it didn't cost so much to return it I would have."
Its cropped. Its not supposed to be cropped. Nope. No thank you.
"They fit, but I really did not like how all of those ""nubs"" felt on my feet.  I returned them."
I had ordered a midnight blue and what I had received was clearly purple!! I was rather disappointed.
said it was cotton. It was 65% polyester....I'm allergic.  Customer service was exceptional and got a refund
Nice bracelet but doesn't come with signature alex and ani box.  Came in plastic bag.  Will buy directly from alex and ani going forward.
These run way too big. I am a size 8 and the 8s fit like a 9. Order at lease one size down.
"Bought a 5 for my 4 year old and it is way too small. Fits a 3 year old perfectly but If I washed it, it would fit a 2 year old"
"Sold for larger size shoes, these looked like the stretchers I received years ago from a relative.  Thee stretchers look good, however they do a poor job of staying place, and do not expand sufficiently to accomplish stretching the leather for comfort. I found that wearing the shoes after treating with a homemade stretching solution of isopropyl alcohol, water and a couple drops of glycerin performed the job better than the stretches."
"I returned  these because they were big and bought a half size smaller, which were a better fit."
Ran small.  Wearing them was painful.  Ended up buying another brand.
The fit of the tank is not as pictured. It's more of a men's style tank with tubbing around the edges. Not what I expected. But print was ok
"As others have indicated, the color is a very faded navy blue, and the quality isn't very good. They basically immediately look old and used, and the ankles stretch out fairly easily because the knit is so loose..."
I just received these and they are a decent pair of sunglasses for the price.  I rated them a 2 star because they are definitely not a light green shade as pictured. It's a deeper shade of green.  Wish they would picture as it really is.
"WOW, both pairs of flip flops broke this week, about a month to the day after delivery.  The piece that goes between the toes just ripped off the base of the shoe.  Had my son wear the other pair and it lasted less than a week.  Now no flip flops.
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
I purchased 2 pair of flip flops for the barefoot boy, both Perry Ellis Portfolio - Mens Flip Flop Sandals, both the same size, one in black, one in red.  The black flip flops fit perfectly.  The red ones were almost a full size larger than the black ones.  Not so happy with the red ones, which would have made barefoot boy very happy.  I donated them to the local food bank and made someone else happy."
I have another exact pair of these shoes and absolutely love them.  So disappointed in my new pair.  Something is different.  The seam on the toe created blisters and I was unable to wear.  Like I said I love my first pair but had to send back my second pair.  I'm not sur what happened in the transition.
"The shape was weird, not at all comfortable to wear."
"Absolutely uncomfortable, and cut into my feet.  They are heavy looking and feeling.  Zipper was hard to manage. Sizing seemed ok.  Shoes are very unforgiving; unfortunately had to return them."
The temple is not right.
Durable but not the best quality.. the fit is too tight.
"Update: I've worn them twice and the heel is cut so sharp it has literally given me blisters and sliced my skin. They make a popping/snapping sound when you walk under your heel, so everyone stares. The noise I can handle, but the awful edge around your heel (and even around the top of your foot) cuts into your flesh making a whole day at work loud AND painful.  You should Pass. Let me be the one that wasted the money on them.

These are not $90 shoes so do not buy these style in any color for that price. That said, I thought these black dotted were ok in person. They were too big and I got an 8.5. I always wear a 9, but you may try a whole size down. They got baggy inside the arch and leave a gap, which I think looks sloppy.  Idk I think if you have fuller/thicker feet you can probably fill them out nicely.  My feet are average.  The other pair (white/tan) I got in 8.5 fit fine.  I kept the tan/white ones. Returned the black dotted ones."
trying to cut it down to fit
"I ordered the size I always wear in bras, but I couldn't even get it over my shoulders. It was WAY too small."
"I have worn Bates combat boots while in the Air Force and loved them. So when I found these biker boots (exactly the style I have been looking for and a good price) I was hoping I would have the same experience. Not so, they are very stiff but that can be softened with wear but there is something strange about the footbed it almost cups the foot, putting pressure on the side of the foot. There is no arch support and the sole is very clunky, these boots were NOT made for walking in my opinion."
Not suitable for a woman.
I am 5'8 and 175. Bought a medium. Shoulder is fine but the waist line is way too large. It will fit perfectly if you have a belly.
Need tapered
Nice chain but challenging hook.
"We tried contacting Skechers complaining of the problem with these shoes! We bought them ahead of time for a special occasion and put them away only to discover them just now! Skechers won't respond to the problem and we were trying to get them return! They're not even worth, still in their original box."
"Really really loved this cover up until I washed it (gentle cycle, cold water). The strings on the bottom we're completely tangled and frayed after :( bummer."
"The dial is big and initially I was content, assuming that's what we get for that price.
But, compared to a lot other watches under the same price-range, this is a very cheap looking one.
The strap has worn out already and I haven't even worn it twice until now.
Please do not go for this. You deserve better!"
"The design of these shirts is nice, but the quality is awful. I ordered several and handed them to the cleaners who handle all my shirts. After 2-3 launderings, all these shirts have shrunk (erratically, in some cases diagonally), and the fabric, which was always thin, has thinned to tissue paper thickness. Buttons feel extremely loose now, and I have lost at least one.

The fit is all sorts of crazy, and definitely not a traditional ""typical American"" fit. I am 5'11"", 180 lbs, 32"" waist. I wear a 16/34 shirt, typically a medium or large, depending on manufacturer, and am a 42R in jacket. The XXL in these shirts does fit my chest and shoulders, but it allows for very little movement, and the tails of the shirt come to my lower thighs."
"Really didn't want to leave a negative review for this wonderful brand but....read all previously negative reviews and still decided to give it a go given a price and our previous wonderful experience with this brand.  Thought we could only wear them on weekends as our 'weekend' no-rough-play shoes to go out in... Well, only after 3 times of such super-gentle wear, the top part of the shoe cracked and split open.  The problem is that while the inside is very soft and padded and leather, the outside of the shoe is stiff plastic. Very sad but will still be on a lookout for this brand, which we love!"
The green bead looks plastic and came broken
Very ill fitting pants. My biggest issue with them is the fact that one leg at the bottom was smaller than the other so it is hard to take the pants off. I literally have to sit down tug at the ankle until it comes off.
Very thin fabric.  Doesn't fit as well as other Hanes undies.
"I really like the idea of an elevated flat, and there aren't many out there.  I first purchased the Stevie by Dansko and they felt like slippers, but with my very thin legs, they looked clunky.  The Season seemed to have the same foot bed, so I ordered them. They are also very comfortable but not designed for a narrow foot.  I had the top as tight as it would go, and it fit, but this did not allow for the leather inevitably stretching with wear.  I had to anticipate that in the near future, they would feel loose.  The back strap was the real problem.  It is made to look like a buckle, but it is actually velcro.  When I tighten it as much as my narrow foot requires, there is not enough velcro-on-velcro to hold it together and the strap kept coming undone.  Could I add more velcro?  Probably- but, for the price, I don't want to have to do that."
This got me through clinicals but damn was it ugly. I looked like a sloppy mad scientist. It was baggy and I believe I got the smallest size.
"Didn't realize the fabric would be a light cotton. Clingy and tight. Maybe some like
t's to fit that way...not me."
"This tie is way too skinny and the color did not quite match the picture. I wanted a gold tie, and this was more orange than gold."
It has two starsbecause it would've been cute but it fit my 10-year-old I gave it to her
these straps are a serious pain in the ass and the material is so loose it doesn't hold your boobs at all
the body part is SO short and tight and the sleeves are SO long and tight. Can't imagine how they designed it.
These look great and seem to be made for quality material. The only problem is that the screw part isn't that tight and they become unscrewed (mostly while sleeping but occasionally at random) and get lost.
There was lace at the top that made them too tight in my calf . I had to cut the lace to make them fit.
"Very pretty, and well crafted in appearance. But if you want to be able to walk, I'd advise against these. Though true to size, the fit was awkward. Very heavy clodhoppers. Not attractive on my foot, can't explain why. Returned these."
"I was looking for a nice summer dress, and decided on this one.  The fabric is thin, and somewhat see through.  I bought a small, (I'm 5'0"" 120 lbs) and it's way too big.  In dressess I either buy a small or medium, and thought since this looks like a ""roomy"" dress, I'd opt for a small.  I'm sending it back because of the size and the fact that it's see through."
Shoes were not black as pictured and they are not truly sized.  I am returning for my money back.  Very disappointed.
"Save your money, get a different wig. I attempted to style this for Ariel and it was a Nightmare. Red hair was EVERYWHERE!"
Not enough stretch in the dress - the equivalent of a cotton t-shirt dress.
Returned the lining & dress were paper thin! Could see through material so returned!
Fits one size smaller than actual size
This was a very uncomfortable shoe.  The material was stiff. I returned it
"A size 10W might have fit better. However, I haven't worn them as yet"
"These jeans are weird I'm not sure why. I ordered my regular size, the fit is great but I was not able to close the button not even close. So I returned and placed a new order for the next larger size, but still to small. Ordered two sizes up this time, still to small to close."
"I should  have known that the NB's would be one size to small, I wear an 11.5 in Nike, 11.5 in adidas, sometimes in Reebok an 11, Timberland an 11. The only bad thing is AMAZON doesn't have the 11. 5. I had to order from Backcountry instead."
Thought this was larger when I bought it. I'll be returning it. Once I saw it less elegant in person.
Way too small for normal men's feet.
Really cheap.... Poorly made. I sent it back
"I ordered the size I have always worn in all shoe types.  These are entirely too tight.  Would never be able to ware them.
The box they were in was almost destroyed."
Champaign color is not too nice -and the shoe is somewhat large so if you are a 8.5 stick to that do not go to a size 9.  Shoe is comfortable. Price is good.  Shipping was excellent but it was unfortunately not my style
"I bought the same pack 2 weeks ago and they fit perfect. This time they were way to small, and don't have all the cushion"
"They're extremely tight in the crotch/top-high area.  I couldn't bear to wear them all day at work.  I am 5'9"" and weigh 130 lbs. and they were a size B."
"I have purchased Acorns in the past and they usually run a bit large. This pair was way too small; in fact I could hardly get it on so I returned them. They were nice looking but in addition to not fitting, they were heavier than what I wanted. I did not reorder a larger size."
"Awfful quality, cheaply made shoes, stiff and the worst plastic odor. i bought two pairs, one black and one tan, the black in despite of have all the aforementioned qualities, is wearable ( if you can afford a cheap look), however the pair of tan shoes is also defective, all glue is at sight, not wearable."
"These shoes looked very cute, and at first I thought they were comfortable, until I'd worn them for a couple of hours.  I walked less than two blocks in them and my feet literally had four holes rubbed in them, one on each foot where the strap goes over the top of the foot, and one on each foot up by my big toe.  I felt the shoes and couldn't find any rough spots or anything, and the shoes seemed to fit me properly, so I can only guess that it's because the stuff they are made out of is quite rigid, unlike normal Crocs.  I have a friend who bought the same shoes (because she thought mine were so cute) and hers didn't seem to do the same thing to her, so I'm not sure what happened with mine.  It makes me sad, because they are so cute and I'd really planned on wearing them a lot this summer, but every time I look at the scars on my feet it reminds me why I should never wear them again!"
Looks larger online small 3-5 year old chair
"The color is great, the pants are soft, the material is fairly warm (they probably aren't winter pants though), and the size fits well. Unfortunately, the pocket size and placement completely threw off the look of the pants. They are not the usual front pocket but, more like mini kangaroo pouches that seemed like an afterthought. They just sag off the front a bit and to use them feels pretty unnatural. If that's your style, go for it; but I donated mine."
Did not receive scarf in picture
Fit like a 5. Too bad. I have a 4.5. This oneuch larger.
I should have returned it but I was to lazy.  It doesn't fell like leather at all. I got what I paid for.  It's not very stylish.
Waaaaaay TOO big so sending back. The print is beautiful but sewn in such a way that the pattern is cut off in obvious places :( Material was quality...Would have kept it true to size and the print was sewn to not cut the head in half!
Heavy material. Too hot for Summer.
"Made in China, manufacturing process skimped on amount of material used for upper.  Extremely low side-walls create an upper shoe that is too small for the size of the footbed.  Although I take a medium width in all shoes, I have such a skinny mid-section that the sides of Ryka shoes almost touch in the middle where the shoes lace.  On this shoe the lace area is splayed nearly two inches wide because of the lack of fabric on the upper.

It does not fit high enough to keep shoe on my heel.  Although Rkya is known for a wider toe box in their shoes, because of the lack of material on the upper of this shoe the toe box is tight.
RYKA, get your old, good manufacturing and sizing standards back!"
"Pretty but too small
Very small. Much smaller the looked on tv. Will send back. Thank s you very much"
"The chain for this locket is chintzy and broke almost immediately.  The locket itself is somewhat loose and the clasp does not have smooth operation.

It looks very nice, but with a broken chain, I don't wear it very often."
Pretty good quality but they roll completely down even after I measured my thighs before ordering. Will be returning.
Did not get the dress pictured. The fabric was cheap and poorly constructed. The proportions were completely off for someone who is 54. Color was also more Kelly green than emerald.
"Cheap, cheap, cheap.  I got these for a Halloween costume for my daughter and they wouldn't stay on for even a few minutes."
"I had high hopes for this dress. Sadly, I have a reasonably long torso, and when it arrived, the bodice of the dress looked like it was meant to have an empire waist, instead of riding on the natural waist. It looked like a computer error in the making of the dress. I contacted Lindy Bop and they helped me send it back to them. I chose not to replace it, given that the shipping cost was pretty high - overseas is never inexpensive... I'd love to try another dress of theirs when I have money to blow again, and I'll happily update my review with any new info from that."
"Only gave these 2 stars after reading other reviews here w/ the same concern: are these genuine Oakley's??  I only have 1 other pair several years old and they have 'made in USA' imprinted into the right ear piece.  These, although they came in a box that said 'Oakley' and 'looked Oakley' and had the zippered hard case, nowhere on the glasses does it say 'made in USA'.  Also, the tag on the cloth bag says 'made in Cambodia'.  So does anyone else purchasing these 'Radar Path' sunglasses have a pair that says 'made in USA' on the ear piece?  And they do not seem to be as sturdy in their construction as my older Oakley sunglasses.  Until I receive some confirmation that says these are genuine 'made in the USA' Oakley sunglasses, I'm going to recommend DO NOT BUY THESE KNOCK OFFS."
Dress runs very small and short
"This bra was extremely comfortable when I first put it on and started wearing it. Unfortunately, the bottom band does not stay smooth for long and was constantly (and I mean CONSTANTLY) curling up throughout the day. It would have been the perfect bra except for that. A sturdier bottom band that held it shape would have made it work. The curling up was so annoying I had to return the bra."
These DO HAVE DOW CHEMICALS on them! RETURNING!
Very disappointed. My feet are extremely sensitive & swollen due to peripheral neuropathy. These 'looked' comfy. They weren't. I put them on for ten minutes & couldn't wait to get them off. Unbearable. Off to find something for my type of feet & the issues.
The boot is okay quality...thinner leather but for the sale price okay. I ordered these for my daughter with a very skinny foot but it was still too tight across the top and where the the bottom of the shaft meets the boot bottom. We are sending them back.
"I can't wear these any longer, if I do then I might run the risk of strangulating a testicle or two."
It's a no go! Looks cheap and material is like 1970 polyester pant material
"Not recommended. The shirt stays have every imaginable design problem an item could have.  They are to short even when fully adjusted for the longest length. I have a 32"" inseam, wear long tailed dress shirts and even with  over the calf socks, the stays are stretched to the maximum. The fasteners are not designed for a common weight dress shirt or dress socks and are very problematic in trying to get fastened. The fasteners may have been designed for women's nylon stockings. The ""Y"" sections are approximately 4"" long which allows the top two fasteners only about 3"" of separation when attached to the shirt tail which makes the Y style stay virtually indifferent from the straight style stay. And the back of the fastener that rubs against the leg feel like sand paper. Not recommended."
"you get what you pay for
pockets suck, not deep at all"
Not difficult and not durable.
runs too small waist does not go up that high
"Good in theory, too small and much smaller than measurements given"
Runs very tight through the upper back and upper arms.  I will be returning.
"Too large for my waist -cant adjust it to fit, guess I'll give it away."
TOO SMALL  NOT AS EXPECTED
Sent it back and purchased on that cost half the price and equal or better quality.
Returned because the xx-large were way too small.
"Fits More like a granny panty,seriously ordered my normal size these things go up to my boobs."
Material is very thin and ripped after two uses. Size is good and the band at the top is very sturdy. I wish that the fabric was sturdier and better quality. Disappointed.
XL was the size of a young child's waist band. Shipped directly from China. Chinese XL must mean American size 0 or something.
"Decrease in quality on this model.  I've lost weight now legs are tighter?  Stitching on waist is like sandpaper.  Gotta wear em inside out.  Improved, softer my ass!"
The pair of socks was twenty dollars - I expected that these would be very comfortable hiking socks but I was disappointed.  They are the correct size and fit but they bunch in my hiking shoes and the padding all seems to be in the wrong place.  They make my feet very uncomfortable and would cause real damage if used on a hiking trip.
it looks like it should be in a doll house. So ugly and not worth the money
These shoes are a bit over my price range so I thought I would see if I could buy 1 for half the price. I thought if I bought one for my husband (they are just his size) then he would be at least halfway cool. Unfortunately buying just one wasn't an option. It's really not fair to people on a budget that these shoes must come in a pair.
"These tanks fit pretty small, if your looking for a loose fit tank top, or if your an average size man, these are not for you"
"Xxl was quite large. Like the design but would say order must be true to size, don't order size up"
Seems like all shoes are made larger nowadays.
"I bought this as a gift - so embarrassed when she called me to tell me that it completely fell apart when she put it on (and no, she's not a big girl!)  So, I could not trust purchasing any of these tops again."
"I want to like this, I really do. But after an hour I'm still fighting with the jumbled mess of straps. Whoever called this ""easy"" fashion is delusional."
Did not do what I expected it to
"These are not for snowy winter activities....they are for 30-40 degree days going shopping or around town.  IMO they do not work well as liners. I have a pair of liners that are cheaper, warmer, and thinner so you can move your fingers better.

I was very disappointed with them."
"I loved them when they arrived and tried them on  .. WOW so sexy .... On my first wear of them the top layer of fabric started wearing off just from sitting in the car on leather seats!  SO embarrassing!  (I'm 5'6"" 118lbs) I don't recommend these due to fabric quality issues."
I had to return these. They didn't fit well.
I loved the design! A much needed addition to the Alegria line.  I was deeply disappointed that they ran so small and that a larger size was unavailable. Very disappointed to send them back.
I ordered a wide and they were to small
Didn't like at all gave it away to much static cling cheap material.
My daughter chose to be Super Why for Halloween so I went ahead and ordered this costume. Awful. Not only is it poorly  made AND doesn't look as pictured.. it had a brown stain on the front of it when I pulled it out of the package. I am sending this back and MAKING a costume for her. I can't send my kid out in this piece of trash.
"The quality is not really good !
Is not worthy
Not satisfied."
scrubs are not khaki they should be listed as chocolate or brown. not pleased
thread coming out on  right upper ankle already.  Only wear as casual around the house?
I give awway I don't like the fabric
"Just received these so this will be an initial review. I will update on durability after a bit. Here is why I rated these 3 stars.

I was fairly disappointed with the coloring on these. The picture showed a dark bronze or light brown color for the gold aviators. They are in fact very gold. So this picture is a bit deceiving.

The glasses feel much sturdier than another, price compatible, purchase I made. Contoured lenses make them snug to the face, which I love! It doesn't feel like these will fall of my face. I have another pair with very flat lenses that just don't feel as comfortable or as snug.

**Edit/Update

I changed my rating from 3 stars to 2 because I have just had a fatality. The nose piece came completely off. I still have 2 more pairs, but I would have been happier if they had lasted at least a month. I know they are cheap, but I think a little more longevity isn't too much to ask."
Granddaughter didn't like the chain
"Horrible! These were definitely not plus sized. They had a run in them when I took them out of the packaging but since my costume was long, I didn't mind.  They lasted about 2 hours before they completely split.
Very disappointed"
Sent it back because the zipper doesn't work. Cheaply made.
"The dimensions of these shoes seemed right for the size, but they still somehow didn't fit - they were oddly too small and too large at the same time. The toe box felt smooshed while there was room in the back of the heel. I think it's because the insole is so slick and slippery that my feet slid right down as if on a slide. The ""floor"" of the shoe is very firm with very little support. Adding an insole with padding and friction might have helped, but I found the shoes so uncomfortable that I just returned them. Too bad, because the ""look"" is very cute and unique."
"Runs small, cute shirt though."
"the buttons are to cheap, the pockets are to wide and big in the front and the bell is not as big as expected, is not as it looks, but since it was cheap the cost of production is fair to the cost of sale"
Cups were wrinkled. The wrinkles in the bra were visible through my dress. I couldn't wear it.
"This is so short that it won't even reach my temples- it is completely NOT wearable, and I have a normal sized head. I will likely return this item as it is useless for anything, never mind for my wedding."
"This bra technically fit I guess, but while somehow, smashing the breasts into the armpits as well as turning them out in a conelike way as if they were running away from each other. Very disappointed."
"Unfortunately, if you ever want to wash them, they pill easily. Maybe it's just me, maybe I don't know how to properly care for them, but one wash and it had pills everywhere. I have had other leggings that I have had for years that never pilled. Plus they were oddly tight around the foot ends."
"The only part of this that has any tightness/support is the bands at the top/bottom. The entire sharper has about as much strength as a tank top that is one size too small. It just clings to you like normal fabric. I got the right size, it was very snug at the top where the band holds it in place, but the rest of the sharper is no better than having nothing on."
The material is too thin for me and it wrinkles too easily.
Ordered the green for my girl to have matching mint shoes with me but these are a very deep green. Disappointed oh well
Inaccurate sizing.  XXL would fit US size M
"Nice looking shoes, but far from being comfortable. I used to be a fan of Aerosoles, but when I tried these shoes I knew they must go back. They were rubbing my toes and overall both shoes felt uncomfortable."
I returned it - not acceptable
Not good fit and side of shoes is too low
Ripped with one use.
"They are sized small, XL is tight on me and normally I wear XL with a little room. The crotch is too tight, the seam is stiff even after washing.  I wake in the night and have to adjust. Looks like I wasted $10. If you are a larger-than-average guy, don't buy these.  Their top size being XL is more of a M-L.  They were washed according to instructions."
No cotton liner
The dress looked nothing like the picture.  It was a stretchy fabric and it's not super low cut at all. Seems like cheap material. Highly disappointed.
Broke before I even wore it.
Cloth not nice
"Theses shoes didn't last longer that 1 month.  If your looking to work out or run, don't bother."
The buckle is bulky and ugly.  Not dressy at all.
This is a nice colored scarf with a basic knit stitch. The yarn however is cheap and provides no warmth.  The scarf isn't even bulky but instead is flimsy and itchy.
These are shoes not slippers.  Their definition of narrow is not mine.  I do have exceptionally narrow feet but their narrow is wider than the Nike and New Balance tennis shoes that I buy. I will keep them as they are slip-ons and will be easier going thru airport security but I expected a soft slipper instead of a shoe that slips on.
"designed improperly in heel area - they really dig in back there!  Ouch - awful!!  Very stiff & ungiving as well.  Trotters used to be made for utmost comfort, not any more."
"I have been bying hanes for probably 40 years. their quality has deteriated drastically. i love the fit of the mid rise. regular fit used to be mid rise now the granny panties are considered regular fit. out of 18 paid i've lost 5 to stitching failure within two washes. I spent about four hours stitching the bottom seam ends just to save about five other pair from failure. these were all made in vietnam, when they were made in Honduras, ten times better quality. don't like colors but they don't make mid rise in white anymore. i also bought white with that new ""OUR MOST COMFORTABLE WAISTBAND"" after a few washes, they are comfortable because the waistband has lost most of its elasticity as if they have been washed and stretched a hundred times, ready to start throwing some of them out after maybe ten washes. i think it's time to switch brands. years ago i had pairs that lasted unbelievable amount of years and actually lasted longer than other pairs i had bought years after them"
"NOT as picutred however, flourescent orange in reality, while pictured more as a muted neutral orange. Too bad, i returned them, they are really cute looking."
"I have successfully worn a pair of this style for several years and just received a new pair to find that one shoe was a quarter-of-an inch longer than the other shoe despite being labeled the same size.  Amazon, of course, dealt fairly with the return (replacement was not available in the color I ordered).  Taryn Rose needs to address substandard production standards which have been questioned in other reviews."
Totally different top from the pictures!!! And way too small!!! :-((
It looks cheap. I've had this since summer and I haven't even worn it yet because it just isn't that spectacular.
Sent it back immediately because stone was cloudy.
"From look and feel the watch is very good. But believe me there is no intelligence. Whatever the global timings is claiming, its not automatic. You have to take the hand to that city by repetitively pressing the buttons. Moreover this watch is made in china and Philippines movement (not even Japan movement). Its a real disappointment from a company like Timex. One more thing since I purchased the product, I haven't received any warranty card, although it's say 1 year Timex warranty. I don't know how to claim this product as authentic. So my advice is please don't buy this product."
"It's a very well made shirt. Great durable material.
See through is a disappoint for this brand and price."
Great fabric but size about what would fit a 20 year old girl
"The fit was fine, but the adhesive barely stuck even on clean (no lotion!) skin! Fell off during my first wear. Will stick to more traditional cup sticky bras in the future."
"I bought 4 pairs of these. Kids wore them 2 days. After the third kid had an awful spill because of three shoes, I just donated them. (I couldn't return because the kids did wear them)
They are much to floppy and loose around the front of the foot. But shoes that are adjustable so the foot is more secure.
First kid his got caught under his bike, big crash, then he was running in the driveway and tripped over the toe, another bloody crash.
2 yr old had 2 big face plants and final straw was my 4 year old daughter was running (not even fast) and these floppy shoes tripped her and she smashed her face.
I never let the other kid wear his and just tossed them all. What a waste of my money. But new sandals that are adjustable are cheaper than teeth.
These are awful shoes. Super cute yeah, but no good."
"These are very 'short wasted'. The elastic has very little stretch.  The opening in the 'fly' is so short, I have the idea that whoever designed them thinks my 'member' and my 'belly button' are in the same area.
Not delivered as described------I wanted just regular rise waist not something so skimpy.
Will send them to our local charity and guess I will have to go to Walmart to find what I want."
"After wearing these for 3.5 months they are making a rubber squeaking noise from the internal sole structure.  Wet, dry, carpet, concrete, the right boot squeaks with every step.  it is getting so annoying, super disappointing considering these replaced 6 year old walmart boots that never made a sound."
"Sucked, rolls up under my butt"
"If I could leave the star section blank I would! These glasses are cheap and didn't last a week. I went to clean the lens with a soft cloth and the lens popped out. Un repairable, because the frame is cracked. I haven't even had them two weeks. I WILL NOT buy from this seller again. These glasses are cute, but flimsy and cheap. If you try to clean them it over!!"
"While the jacket itself is obviously very very well made - the size Large is NOT made for a size 16 woman like me.  I couldn't even get the placket to close.  It is made for a woman who is built straight up and down -- no hips or thighs and that ain't me.  I sent it back and got a refund.  Overall, I find that clothing made in China never fits me -- it's always way smaller than the size number would indicate.  (Yes, this was made in China)."
"This is my first pair of Cole Haan shoes and probably the last. The shoes look great and feel moderately comfortable. My issue is that they are very slippery on wet floors. I've never experienced such poor traction with other shoes. My first mishap was when I came inside our office building from the rainy outdoors and the soles of my shoes were wet. I slipped in a stairwell and took a bad fall. Since then I have been very careful not to wear these shoes in wet conditions. However, I recently wore them in our office cafeteria, walked over a small spill, and took a bad fall.

I'm surprised that Cole Haan doesn't account for this in the material they use."
"Nice feel, nice cut, nice color, the size is not accurate. I ordered Asia L/US M, but it's more like US S... other companies don't seem to have this issue..."
yes this is cute but knots so easily and not as long as the picture. Thought it would be easier to care for.  Was getting it for the kiddo to use during dress up but got tired of vacumming up pink hair everywhere.
If you like small purses this is the one its very stylish but too small
"I couldn't wait to get this sweater, but was completely disappointed in the workmanship.  It was horribly frayed at the neckline, and I was shocked that someone let this sweater go out like that - and at $46.00 to boot.  It's too bad, because I really did like the sweater.  Do not buy."
"Ordered two belts 6 months ago, one black and one brown. Had been using reversible belts but they didn't last. Thought that these belts would cost most and last longer. Today the loop that holds the belt end fell off. The leather holding the loop tore in half. The belt is still usable if you slide the belt loop onto the belt before you buckle it. Inspected the black belt and it still looks good. I liked these belts and may order a replacement but will wait to see if the other belt fails as well. Belts have held up well otherwise."
"This is very inappropriate. As a Chicana, I find this highly offensive. Do not make fun of my culture and ethnicity. This is why stereotypes, micro aggressions, and racial slurs continue to hurt people because of ""costumes"" like this. Take this down."
Wish I had been able to send them back as I had a knee replaced and cannot wear them at all and I am past the send back date.
weird cut...uncomfortable.
The dress pictured was not what I got in the mail.
Im going to return this item and change it for a bigger size
"I am 5'7"" and the dress is too short . The fabric is ok , the silverfish spots are actually dirty white ones . I would like to return it , but they want 20% restocking fee . It is ridiculous ((("
"These are not shoes that will last on little boys.  When my son first wore them, he liked their comfort and the elastic pull string.  Well, the elastic pull string now looks like a tassel (its burst apart into tiny strings of rubber) and there are already holes in the shoes.  Literally, in 1 month.  I would not recommend unless buying childrens shoes every 3 weeks is something you enjoy doing."
More like an extra large then medium.  I wanted an exchange but because the cost to send it back to China is too expensive they just gave me a refund.  I will have to have it altered to fit properly.
"Nice and comfortable, but the quality is very poor. They stretched out of shape and tore apart on the side of the shoe within 2wks."
Beautiful dress but the size chart didn't match
Thought it was so cute and the price was right... But the bottoms were WAY too small. They fit like a regular two piece bottom almost. Definitely not like the picture! Super disappointed. :(
These shoes are pretty uncomfortable. I have gotten major blisters from them.
These really fell apart very quickly but hey I wasn't expecting too much for the price.
One shoe what at LEAST 3 sizes smaller then the other even thought it was label the same
My daughter has pretty normal feet. These are wide and the straps do not hold her foot well so they slide around.
I've ordered other colors of these shorts and they all fit well.  These black with white trim were about 2 sizes smaller than the others I'd ordered but labelled as same size.  Not worth returning so I cut slits up the outside legs and use them as sleep shorts.
It was very short and poorly made but that's not the worst part! When I opened it it had the worst formaldehyde smell I have ever experienced from clothing. I felt like I was bout to dissect a cat in anatomy class. Absolutely awful.
Did not fit as expected does not hold up breast more like flattens them like pancakes I hidden  this in the back of my closet behind my dresser so my husband and see I wasted the money
"I bought a couple of these to wear around the house.  The size made it nice and loose, which is what I wanted.  The material is most 'interesting.'  It feels like light weight CANVAS!  I can actually picture a tent made of this cloth!  Rough, scratchy and it has a slight smell to it.  After washing 6 times (by hand because it bleeds,) one of the shirts is getting softer.  But, remains scratchy. Calling the shirt 'heavy,' is a laugh.  I was too lazy to return them, but would never, ever order from this manufacturer again."
Ordered the black size 7-14 for my 7 y.o. They arrived quickly but were quickly sent back. The glove sizing is way off - she can barely get her hands into them. Much too small.
they are not as cute as i thought they might be.
"comfortable at first however they are of very poor quality.  After repairing the broken arm 3 times, the arm fell off while on bike and of course the glasses came off and they were lost.  To top it off, the return time frame expired 14 days ago so they will only give partial credit. Should have returned them the first time they fell apart.  Lesson learned, I will never buy another item made by this company."
"The panty portion is too small, the breast part gives zero support. it's cute in theory"
This item appears to not contain real amber.  Real amber can be detected using a black light.  This appears to be fake.
Write out of the box you could notice right away all the seams were glued and not made as well as they could be.
"Excited to receive these as the style was unique. I ordered a size larger then normal as most of the clothes made in China fit small. However these were too small to button. I wear a 36, ordered a 38 and would need about a 40 or 42 to fit. After reviewing the material closer I decided to not order a larger size as the material is a bit too thin and I fear they would tear easily and quickly."
Top was way too small
Looks faded. Like as if it has been washed 100 times.
Ordered double zero and got maybe a zero. Super disappointing. They run too small.
"Nice but not worth the money. If you are on their fence, don't get it."
Uncomfortable and rolls down
I will NEVER order this product again
Unfortunately these Keen whisper slides did not work for me.  I had to return them.
"It was my fault. I didn't notice ""slim"" in the description, and it truly was a very narrow shirt."
"I got the extra large and it was delivered from China -- the extra large would fit a child.  In fact, I asked my sweet niece to put it on and it fit her perfectly.  I had to pay a bunch of money to return it to China!  Thanks Amazon!"
"The breast cups when unclupping to nurse is uncomfortable
You have to fix the pad and the pad actually loses the shape
It's super tight and I have the size it recommends
I wouldn't buy again"
JUST TOO SMALL AND NARROW
Had to return because it fit much smaller than expected. The pocket is situated very low too and looks awkward.
"Weird material , and doesnt feel comfortable."
Not for big busted ladies...empire waist leaves little room for the girls.
"Wrong color, wrong style, immediately returned."
Material is rather thin. You may have to wear an undershirt.
"First of all they smell, and then they loose color. Losing color is normal, but not for this one as both my hands were black while I tried them.

So glad was able to return them, but they suck"
way too small-i bought an xl-fit more like a medium.
Sized too small.  If they were true to size they would be a great shoe....go up a size perhaps if you like the look.  My 8 seemed more like a 6 and I had to return it.
"I am an adult with a small face and these glasses were too big for me.  They fit my 6""4"" husband perfectly."
Crown wheel came out of watch as I was setting the time and date the first time.
Way too small and very flimsy
"shirt fits very snug, material gives no give so very constricting. buy a size larger for bigger guys"
"seller was awesome, shipping costs from china are too high, she gave me 5$ back and i guess its worth t considering i didn't have to send it back. im 5'5 125 lbs. bought small (maybe medium better). I have 38 inch hips and  a bit of a butt, this was too much accentuation for the lower half as well."
"The fabric is very stiff, cheap stuff. The lace is scratchy. I know you cannot expect too much for the price, but you can get much nicer things in this price range. Even from Dreamgirl. I was OK with the camisole but the ""pant"" was like a joke. Too much fabric, too stiff and too short... Returned it"
Watch was broken when i received it POS
Cup size was small.
Just an overall awkward fit. Not a fan.
"Very nice, but the top was extremely small. I had to purchase a size large and it only covered half of my breast, so sizing is way off."
These socks began to fall apart after the first use. The stitching literally began to come undone and strands were sticking out.  They are also fairly small feeling.  I can't act surprised though given how cheap they were.  I tried to save a few bucks by buying these over the more expensive ones.  I would not do that again.  I would not recommend these socks.
"Bad quality, it does not look like the picture"
This stuff makes me greasy and I break out when I use it.
"I was expecting a much nicer quality, unfortunately the mask I received could have been bought for $5...
Very disappointed.even with the two little pieces of foam inside this mask is very uncomfortable .
I saw that this was an import from Shanghai and it took over two weeks to get here...I would not recommend, waste of money. I saw the other reviews, I am assuming they changed the quality..."
The closures never stayed closed.  Unwearable.
Why would they ever make black face socks. Tacky. Unacceptable.
"Didn't like these boots. I wear a size 7, so that's what I ordered. I have a high arch and had a tough time getting my foot down into the boot. That's when I noticed how uncomfortable these boots were. The way the sole is designed, it actually made me rock back onto my heels, which meant my toes felt higher than my heels. I know I never would have found comfort in that position, so I had to return them."
"I've worn a 10.5 all my life, so that what I ordered. When they arrived, they were about a size and a half too big! Beware, they run very big, if you wear a men's 10.5, then order a 9!"
"I got these expecting to have a MADE IN THE USA alternative to my Hanes MADE SOMEWHERE ELSE socks.  They felt great the first time I put them on, however, after just 1-3 washes, at least one of the pairs is already getting a hole in the toe.  While I like the USA aspect, I can't justify the price difference if they are not going to last as long.  Sad."
Had to return because the product was way too small.  Didn't cover his cheeks at all and he isn't a large person.  The front was too awkward.  The hole was too high and not sewn in the right space compared to the shaft cover.
"What have we become?.... We simulate stones now? Who? When you meet the person of your dreams for those of us who have intelligence, What do you give her. Do you give her a stone made by man? No if you love her you give her a stone created by time in the natural world its a true love stone. Shame on these people who do this. I want to get down on my knees and propose to her with something time made not someone else. Sorry Amazon."
Its a cute watch but not what I was expecting.. This says its a time teacher watch... I no way is the face big enough to help teach a child to tell time. Cute but way t small for the purpose I purchased it for.. Ill return this and look for another watch maybe one that talks.
The chain link on one of the sandals was twisted which made the shoe uncomfortable to wear. It hurts!! Also it runs small. I do not recommend
"The color of the dial isn't blue. It's more dull, faded purple. Was unable to find a serial number, so am returning this watch."
"I loved the way this shoe looked. They were very comfortable. Unfortunately, one if them squeaked when I walked, so I returned them."
"I was really disappointed with the quality of these shoes.  Although the style is so cute, they came with little strings popping out the edge of the man-made leather.  You know the little white threads that after cheap shoes begin to get worn out you have to use a small scissors to trim off the edge of the straps? I paid $32 for them and decided the quality didn't warrant the price, so returned them.  I also expected better from the brand, Billabong.  A couple weeks later I noticed they had the audacity to increase the price on here to $45 SMH.  Currently I see the price has dropped to $25. Perhaps for $25 they're worth it, as they are super cute. Just be forewarned of the quality.  I found a different brand that I'm much more happy with."
Cheap shirt & material!
It fit to big.
Cheap material and hardware
I ordered 2 sizes up and it still is not even in the vicinity of fitting. Literally couldn't even get it over my head and it has ZERO give. I could tell it would have been adorable too!
"So these came in the mail, I go to put them on right away and they tore. Just like that. Very disappointed. Don't waste your money people. Got them in the mail and three them out within 10 minutes of receiving them. If I could put zero stars I would have"
Material is just ok.
Large shirt and when you raise your arms you can see all the way down to your bra!!! Not a fan of this style
A bitA
"The rhinestones fell off, even some in shipping envelope. Poor quality."
Cheap feel for a Seiko. Band too small for someone that is 6' and 208 lbs
"I was super excited to see that this had been delivered, and couldn't wait to get home and try it on. Put batteries in, get myself into the suit, turn the power on, and nothing. Dead fan. Tried different batteries, same thing. Even tried a battery pack from another inflatable costume, still dead. Now, unfortunately I won't have a dinosaur handing out candy this year, as nothing else will be delivered in time for Halloween. I'm sure it looks wonderful when it's working though, and if I get another and it works, I'll update this review, but until then, I will sit in sadness at my lack of T-Rex. :("
"The material is very thin. The rayon as well is thin. The studs aren't studs, they are thin cheap metal looks like it's about to fall off."
Vaste of money. Smallest drizzle and yor feet are wet. Don't buy.
"Comfortable pair of shoes, nice colors and design, lots of room in the toe area.  My only complaint is the mail service;  it took almost 2 weeks to arrive AFTER it was shipped.

UPDATE (5/27/17):  It hasn't been a year since I bought these shoes, and I have 2 holes in the toes.  One hole in each toe that appeared 6 months after I bought them.  I run/walk an average of 22 miles a week.  I won't buy these again.  The light weight mesh material on top of the shoe does NOT last.

I have bought Saucony running shoes for the past 15 years and they've lasted.  These shoes did NOT live up to my expectations.  They should last longer than 6 months!  Back to the drawing board guys!"
"Way too big for my arm size and the watch band seemed comfortable but not strong enough to keep this very large, heavy watch on a person's arm.  All hands on the watch seemed to be inexpensively stamped metal items with illuminating paint on them.  Not my style of watch for a titanium watch.  Sent back."
"Awesome looking bra. Runs small, so medium is a 34B but not a 34C. Good design, no underwire but supports and the low underarm means you can't see it under nightgowns or tank tops.

However the lace is itchy enough I'm delighted to take it off in the morning and washing it has revealed flaws in the lace. (Yes I know all my lingerie should be hand washed in cold water and hung up, but frankly I have bras that survive the washer).

I'll buy a boring lightweight tank bra next time."
bad quality.  cheap made
Very cheap looking/made.
They look more like keds then vans.  Material feels cheap as well. But the prices isn't bad!! Feel cheated man
"This fit strangely even for a bolero, it bagged out in strange places and wasn't comfortable. I returned it."
This product is thin and cheap...very Walmart. I returned. Disappointed in burts bees
Go to Walmart if you're poor. I regret buying this. I know my fiance is still going to love me & he will act like he likes it. We are broke so this is it for now. Save your money and get something else! It's way too light and gets dirty quickly. Some other dude on here wrote a review about how his isn't very durable.
Poorly designed for a size 16 woman. The closure would have to be several inches below my belly in order to close and at that point my hip are to big. This a size I often wear.
They boots tore as I was pulling them up for the first time. Payless would have  been made better you get what you pay for and these were too much cheap
"Way to small. The 2XL was about the same size as a men's medium shirt...maybe large, but I doubt it. Returned it."
"It looks nice and is warm, but I feel like it has a tear somewhere and my feet are constantly soaked when it rains...I probably should have returned this product but I kept thinking maybe it was just me. After trodding around through snow and rain, now I'm certain there was a little rip somewhere when I first got it :("
I wish the center stone was more pronounced to give it the wow factor..disappointed
"Maroon color is more of a bright red. The elastic on the leggings is too thick to be able to wear it under a form-fitting dress or skirt. The seams on the inner leg are very noticeable, but the fabric is soft and not too thick. It's breathable enough to wear on a hot sunny day, but does not fit tightly like other leggings (I am 4'11"" and thin)."
"The product description says these fit up to a 4E width. I wear 4E and my feet are swimming in these socks.

In addition, there is a chunky, scratchy seam that goes across the top of the toes. It is very uncomfortable. Why do manufacturers do this? Do they even both trying on products like this to see if they're comfortable or not?"
I ordered 3 packages of 2 shirts which would be 6 shirts. I received 3 shirts shorting me 3 shirts.
Ive had these for some time now and the quality was not what I expected from NB. Probably won't buy NB agave n in the near future. Im really kinda bummed that theyve started making such cheep products
"I used this product for several years to provide a non-slip surface to the interior of ring bands - as well as sizing the bands down a bit for a snugger fit on my finger.

The past - successful - purchases had dried white and stayed on my rings for weeks or more of wear, including taking on/off prior to daily swimming.

Alas my most recent order doesn't work at all - zero.  They may have changed the composition as the most recent adhesive dries clear and the prior solutions had all dried white.

The current formula slides right off my rings (more than one so not an isolated event) the first time or two I put on.  The prior formula worked & I would recommend, the current does not & is a waste of time."
Bottoms were torn shirt has two buttons missing
Beautiful wig but more for Halloween or some sort of party. Not very realistic looking!
"Product does not match description or even its own packaging.

The product shown has padded shoulder straps that adjust at the bottom. Also the leash attaches to a D-ring.

The one I received looks the same from the front, but has regular, unpadded straps that adjust at the neck. This means rough material and hard plastic buckles are rubbing directly on my child's neck.

Arg, I rest past reviews that mentioned these issues, but given the photos, I just assumed Brica had updated their item.

Either they have a manufacturing issue (old product in new packaging) or I got a knock off.

I am returning to Amazon."
Strap broke after 3 uses.
I'm a big girl and I know my size.  It was snug and uncomfortable around my thighs.  The rest fit perfectly.  If the leg holes were just a wee big larger I'd keep them.
"So, large they fit my spouse who has feet that are at least 3 sizes bigger than I."
"There should be at least two hooks at the top of the dragon so it can rest on top of the ear. There is nothing along the top of the dragon to hold it in place along the helix of the ear. The piece is beautiful: tarnished gold. And it looks exactly like the photo. While some customers had bent posts, my little package came in bubble wrap so the post was undamaged. I think the price would be excellent for an item like this, that has a better way of holding onto the ear. However, because the earring is not even wearable, I cannot give it more than one star. For those few customers who made this earring work, I'd like to know if they wrapped the earring around their ear helix, or simply let it rest against the ear. I cannot image the earring would stay on with even one turn of the head."
"I was very disappointed as I really liked the blue colour in this sandal, the colour was not as shown in pics, I have wide feet and my feet are all over the place in sandal, additionally I bought them a half size bigger and my feet hangs over the back.  Tried them when I got them, have never worn them.  Very disappointing."
Bag looks to cheap. Sent mine back
"Got them for running/walking.....noooooo! Every landing is like you're bare foot. Wishful thinking on my part at that price( under $30) Fine for casual wear, just don't buy for athletic use."
95% cotton and run small is not a good combination. I should have ordered one size up. I hope they fit after a washing
Not a good look for me..They look like monkey.. Just blah
"After an hour or two of usage, the front buckle fell off. The bag is no longer closable, and I can't use it because things will fall out."
"I would not recommend this jeans. The material feels really cheap and thin (And yes, they're cheap jeans to begin with, but I can get $18 jeans at target with better quality), and the zipper on mine broke after I wore these pants twice. The fit is also really awkward - they weren't too small, and not too big, but they fit in a really odd and unflattering way around my waist and hips."
"Nice shoe but very, very large.  I didn't try the 46 but I own size 47 in three other Ecco models (Austin, Seattle, and Traverso) and this 47 was much, much larger.  I gave up because I could see that the plain rather pointed toe would look big on me anyway. I think the shoe would do best for a very big guy or for very small feet.  And order down by all means."
"Ordered size large for my 6' 180 lb husband, size 34 waist.  He swam in it, so was product was mis-sized and unfortunately costume as originally ordered looked bad. Also the 'medallion' looked good in the pic but was quite flimsy and cheap looking. Definitely do not recommend given sizing was so misguided.  If you happen to order the right size the costume will likely look good, but have to rate it a 1 as that was not my experience with this product at all."
"About a year ago, I was offered a free Tru-Spec Men's Dri-Release Jersey T-Shirt (White, X-Large) for review via the Amazon Vine Program, and I accepted.

I have tried various brands of T-shirts over the years like Jockey and Stafford.  Some are better than others and in general, and they are all overpriced lately.  But they all have one thing in common, the T-shirts I normally wear are 100% cotton.  I really wanted to like this Tru-Spec shirt.  I tried to wear it numerous times.  But every time I tried to wear it, I thoroughly disliked the way it felt on my skin, especially on my neck and upper back... It just felt uncomfortable to me.  It's not that it wasn't soft, but there is something about this shirt that made me keenly aware it was there.  Whereas with my normal cotton shirts, I put them on and forget about them.

I felt that the fit was good for the X-Large size.  The neck opening is sized well.  The sleeve and overall length is okay.  The stitching is nicely done.  I really have no complaints about the construction... only the feel of the fabric, it just doesn't work for me."
Again due diligence was not exercised in the selection of the size. A size larger than ordered was shipped. Be more  meticulous to reduce these types of deficiencies.
These slippers went right back. They were very poorly made.
"Out of the box was awesome, once washed it was unwearable"
"Faded colour, very very thin and flimsy material.

I would not recommend. The photo and in reality and two different things.

Do not purchase!"
"I bought two 3-packs for my husband.  They are soft and cushiony and he was excited about them.  Unfortunately, at the end of the first day of wearing them, there was a hole in the top of the sock.  The hole did not coincide with a toenail area and he'd just trimmed his nails anyway.  I think this is a manufacturing error, but since it's only 1 of 6, I'm not sure what we're going to do about it, yet.  He's going to keep wearing new pairs to see if it keeps happening."
"My husband recently retired from the military and has always like big, beefy watches, usually in a 40mm or so case size.  As retirees tend to get gold watches, I thought this would be a nice watch for him.

The Invicta is ENORMOUS, measuring a 50mm case.  He is not a small man by any stretch but the watch is almost cartoonishly large on his wrist.  It's also quite hefty at 9oz/270g on our kitchen scale.  After having five(!) links removed at our local jeweler, he's worn it for several days.

Pros:
-Hefty, robust construction
-Relatively attractive Omega-esque styling
-Accurate time (Swiss-made Ronda X60 mechanisms, like all quartz mechanisms, are quite accurate)

Cons:
-It's absolutely huge
-The face is somewhat cluttered and the multiple little dials combined with skeletal hands makes legibility a challenge
-The instruction manual is in microscopic text on a four language instruction sheet with four languages on a 12x12"" folded sheet.  Bright light and possibly a magnifying glass are in order as the three button mechanism isn't terribly intuitive.  Not Omega X33 confusing, but not straightforward.
-No illumination on the face or hands.  Not weak illumination. NO illumination. Unreadable in low light.

All told, it's huge. It's cluttered.  It's only rated to 50m, hardly a ""diver's watch"".  The watch would probably look better on my brother in law, a former college football lineman who has wrists big enough that it doesn't look like Flavor Flav's clock attached to a wristband."
Poor quality. Cheaply made.
The quality kinda sucks. Plus under the heel it feels like there's a rock or something stuck in it.
It is not that great if your torso is average to long. Good product other than that; the steel bones rock.
"I like the fabric and the colors, but the fit is so off. The sweater has extremely long arms and an extremely short body."
Cheap material. Tacky looking.
"I like the color but not the dress. I bought a medium for my weight of 148, it fits well but the style is far from what I expected it to be. The skirt part at the front is way too short for the style and I don't like the material for that style of dress."
Ordered a small and received a large. It can't be that difficult to correctly read the size on an order and double check that the item matches.
the jeans that i receive look nothing like what i saw online and order and its to large very disappointed
"Way over sized. Terrible material. Ruined the very first time I washed it (delicate wash, hang dry). Awful product, I would never buy anything from this provider again. Its all terrible quality."
"I am a sanuk fan, but these shoes are not sanuk quality. They don't have any structure so the heel constantly falls down. I expected them to be true slip on shoes. Very disappointed."
Not good. Soles wore out after 6 mos.  Not worth it.. Stitching came undone on the front of the shoe.
"Instantly broke. Never even got to wear it. By the way, I have very small wrists so it's not like I stretched it out."
"I purchased these tanks in a medium, specifying that being a 38-40"" chest,  and they fit accordingly.  I wear these as undershirts with knit polo and dress shirts. For this use, the fit of these undershirts would be perfect when worn as such. However, there is a problem with them that resulted in a 2 star rating and a refund request.  This issue has to do with the seam at the top of the shoulder.  It is poorly constructed and finished as I will attempt to capture in the photos.  Now I am no seamstress but I am competent with a sewing machine, and to me it appears that the seams in question are some kind of serger chain seam with looper threads that are not at all finished leaving those pieces sticking out.  This combined with the fact that the seam too tight leaving it puckered, you have an uneven seam that would be obvious under any shirt that lays flat over your shoulders appearing like little bumps just to the sides of your collarbones.  Perhaps I am being overly critical, but I expect an undershirt to be inconspicuous and these shirts certainly did not meet that criteria.  I compared these to some older tagless Hanes tanks i wear regularly and it just appears the quality control isn't as good as it once was."
"I usually don't write reviews but these t-shirts are junk. They are only suppose to be part cotton but they sure seemed like all cotton to me. Washed them 3 times to shrink and they got all out of shape. I threw it in the rag pile, didn't even wear it once. I'll stay with next level for now."
"Very small, couldn't use..wanted money"
"Not enough room for large breasted women. Came with brief bottoms, not boy shorts as stated."
Shoes are very bulky and for they fall off easily. My son does not like to keep them on for long.
They scuffed up pretty fast.  She only wore them a few times and fell apart.
Beautiful watch. This watch is VERY large and heavy. I could not make the metal clasp fully lock in place and the band kept opening allowing the watch to fall around my hand.
I had to send these back for refund as I think they sent a child's lg size. I couldn't get my calf into the waist. Listing said adult???? didn't want to chance another wrong size sent as hunting season is here so I chose a refund to buy local. Quality seemed great.
"They were too small for the price,a little disappointed!!!"
This had a really really bad smell and discoloration to the right sleeve upon arrival.
"Sending back.  I really like the color of this sweater, but it had no shape and just hung on me."
not the shirt in the photo!
I bought these to wear to work (retail) because they were padded on sides and all black. It's only been three months and there is already a huge hole in the sole. Money wasted
I gave it a chance inspire of the reviews. Don't waste your money. This is not a winter jacket. The zipper you just have to zip slowly but it was a pain in the butt to remember. As for the color of the zipper mine was covers by the flap that the zipper was getting stuck to smh.
"I ordered a half size  bigger than usual just in case, and they were too small!"
Was kind of saggy... came turquoise not bright mint like in the licture... pretty disappointed
"Material is too thin, waist band feels cheap, leg band too tight, and they're awkwardly long."
I bought these because of all of the craze of how comfy they are. They didn't work for me. Not enough support.
This sucks
I do NOT like this posture bra at all..I ordered it in the same size bra I usually wear and it is too big.  It is also very scratchy.  It did not work for me..
bought a 2x and its was still too small  nice jumpsuit just wish it fit
"When looking at everyone's photo reviews, everyone got one with round lace edges instead of the ""straight line"" border that's shown in the product photo. That'd have been perfect, but that's not what I I received. Something is ""off"" about these product discrepancies, and I wish I would've gotten the beautiful product everyone else did! Maybe once upon a time you'd have gotten one with pretty round floral edges, but they changed the product? The reviews and photos do not at all match the product I received. Also one side was longer than the other, couldn't wear it if I wanted to."
sized to fit an elementary school aged girl
These shoes are small and don't fit well in the heel. They are also very stiff and do not have much cushioning.
A size L was way too big. Don't know if it was mislabeled or not.
Not worth $20+.
"[Previous review: This appears to be a good quality set. I like it. There may be one quality issue that could take it down in time.]

Updated Review: This did appear to be a good quality set. Sadly, the fabric at the underarm intersection has disintegrated, after one month.

It is more than large enough for me. It is not just the seams, but the actual fabric holding the seams that is turning into holes.

[Previous Review: I've had it about two weeks, and the shoulder seam, possibly where they stuck that annoying plastic T-tailed tag holder, looked like it may be coming out. But a closer look, although uncertain, shows that it may be just part of the white seam facing. I hope so!
If the seam goes out before a few years (these were bought to replace a set of winter PJs I had had since 2004! And secondhand at that!), I will contact the seller and complain, and bust its rank by taking off a few stars.
If it is good and the seams hold, I'll recommend it, wear it with pleasure, and maybe buy another.
Star Trek customer service, I will be hailing you on all frequencies.]

Updated review: I really liked this set. I am returning it. But it makes me sad. I think it could be made better and last longer, if the company wants to do so. If so, I would try them again.

I bought them to replace a set of long cool weather PJs that I had had since 2004. Yes, 11 years before they fell apart. And they were secondhand when I got them!

I expected this set to last a few years. It would have been disappointing to have it last only one or two years. But a month... I'm just sad about it."
Nice dress but size was not accurate at all
"Alas, Crocs has designed a good looking flat sandal that unfortunately misses the mark with difficulty keeping this shoe on as you walk.  It slips off and requires strenuous toe clenching action to keep it on your foot.  Come on Crocs, please design a flat sandal that stays on, and doesn't make your foot sweat.  The Patricia 2 wedge style fits great, looks good, stays on, but your foot sweats.  Oh so close indeed.... HT"
"I was going to give this more stars, then I realized I only bought this bag 3 months ago. It didn't last as long as I thought it had. One wheel is broken, or the arm straps got caught in the wheel while rolling it, or something. It can't be rolled anymore. I expected a backpack to last at least 1 entire school year."
These are not very comfortable.  The foot strap on the right foot is so loose you can't walk in them.  The left foot strap is fine..
"1st of all, it is not sized for women.  I expected the large face.  but there is no way to size it for a womans wrist."
"...than in real life, or on your wrist.

I'm sure it's an accurate and reliable timepiece as all Seikos tend to be, but I just had to send mine back.  Really disappointing, because I have been looking for a nice BLACK metal watch for under $200 for a long time now, and jumped at the Kinetic movement (no batteries!) and Seiko reliability.

Unfortunately, I didn't realize just how distractingly and distressingly RED the rotating bezel is, and also as another reviewer pointed out, there is a fundamentally WEIRD or OUT OF WACK sense of scale between the overall huge size of the watch case and the tiny, almost dainty, size of the actual dial and hands.  In a nutshell, when worn on my wrist it looks like two watches in one: a huge honkin' clunky men's diving watch, with a dainty women's watch inside of it.

Build quality is excellent, and I liked the weight and heft of this watch.  But sorry, it's just butt FUGLY, if you ask me.

I strongly suggest you go find this watch in a shop and try it on first, before ordering online.  I was very fortunate to have ordered it from a website with a decent return/refund policy...whew!"
"Terrible fit, I even ordered the next size up. I had to get an emergency work shirt, they were supposed to provide anyway, but I got bumped to the top of the list when I came in wearing this one."
"I don't know my limit on returning this as I have been away for a month, so I will have to call."
"I bought 4 of these thinking that is a ""Brand Name"". The waste band is fine. The rest of the MATERIAL loosens up after a few hours around the legs and ""Higher"" and becomes very uncomfortable. I do not recommend this particular make by ""Addidas"""
"I was hoping they would fit good, because I liked the material. But they have a baggy fit on a narrow, thin built man. I had to return them."
"after a year...here is the update after another 3 x 1 month adventures...the bag itself is heavy so even though it is high capacity (VOLUME), because of it's own 8lb weight and 50 lb limit at airport that doesn't address the capacity I have needed.  The wire wrapped edges for structure on the top side have all frayed right down to the wire and have had to be taped to avoid totally shredding wire edges off bag.  The wheels and handle have held up well and it still moves the goods just fine, but it looks a mess with the tape repair, the continual need to tape over newly exposed wire edges so I no longer would recommended, even though I originally said:  very pleased with this sturdy duffle.  It is keeping me organize on month long business trips and holding up well through brutal airport conditions and travel destinations like Haiti and Iraq!  It is a bit heavy ...empty...but that's the trade off for sturdy and the handle, feet, wheels are all doing well after 2 months on the road"
Gave away too small
"This suit is tiny. Even the bottom was smaller than expected. If you have breasts or anything larger than a flat, elongated back, this suit will not fit. Returned."
"These t-shirts are extremely poor quality. I was shocked how thin they are. When I say ""thin"" I mean transparent. The photo was taken from the back of the t-shirt--even the logo shows through. My kid put it on and you could even see his belly button! I guess if you're an exhibitionist this is the t-shirt for you.

I would have returned them but my kid had to have extra t-shirts for tie-dying at camp and we didn't have enough time to order something else. Hopefully the tie-dye will make it less see-thru. Aside from agreeing with everyone that these shirts run a full size too small, the thin quality isn't something you can overcome. I would really just get something else. I used to think Hanes was a good brand. If I have to order t-shirts again I would go with the Fruit of the Loom, https://www.amazon.com/Fruit-Loom-Boys-White-Medium/dp/B00VTV9NFM."
"Bought this for a Xmas gift and very disappointed. First, it really doesn't look like this. Second the light that is supposed to glow didn't work . What a shame."
"This shirt took about 2 1/2 weeks to arrive, and the packaging indicated that it came from somewhere in Europe.  The size is shown as an XL, but is more like a tight large.  Shirt fits tight on neck, and shrank noticeably after wash.  The supplier is usually pretty good with promptness and quality, but not on this order."
its suppose to be a dress not a tube top. i am tall but it was way too short. it was not true to size or even close to it.
"Worst finishing, doesn't look like a picture, disappointed."
"very tiny, looks cheap"
"Not sure why would they be open is TSA did not open. But on my trip , i changed the combination and the luggage when arrived the locks were easily able to open. I checked with the baggage service and asked why my luggage was opened and they had told me that it wasn't . If tsa opened it they would place a inspection check on it notifying they opened the luggage."
It's not very good quality.  It's thicker material than most other ties and susceptible to wrinkling.
"I have the very same jeans in a dark blue, but these grey are really tight, hard to zip type tight.
They seem to be a size smaller than their label."
Didn't like first it fit perfectly after couple use it turn to big that too many times I was going to fall not safe to wake with and too bulky and heavy
got this to help make a ball gown puffy and it really just smooshed under the dress so it looked the same.
"I ordered the same size in a different cut of Levi's and the waist on this seemed tighter. Which was weird, because there was too much fabric in the butt area. My guess is this is par for the course, since nothing is made exactly to manufacturer's specifications these days. You won't know what you're getting until you try them on."
"WAY too difficult to get onto the feet, even with the zipper. Meh."
This costume was not marked clearly. It did not specify if it was for an adult or child. Consequently it was too large for my 7 year old nephew and I had to return it. When I clicked on the size chart it gave children's sizes. Very confusing.
it's too big for me. to wear it
Too Small and way too short!! You bend over slightly and Everything is showing!! great if you're a hoochie momma!
the button cannot be hooked properly
The outfit is very cute but if you have any length to you don't order I looked like I was headed out to a flood not dinner
"I sent back and reordered, still broke within a week."
"RETURNED. After walking just a few feet inside the house, I could tell the forefoot OUTsole isn't wide enough for me.  It is much narrower than my last NB shoes, tennis and trainer. So much so that I'd be worried about stepping on a thumb-sized pebble and turning over my ankle. I need a lot of lateral stability. YOUR MILEAGE MAY VARY."
"I wear a 6, and i don't have narrow or wide feet. Couldn't even get they on, sent them back."
Normally I love Bogs as very durable.  But these have developed a hole inside the back of one of the heals after only 7 months of infrequent use.  I can only assume these are either defective or poorly designed.  I've had my other pair of Bogs for at least 3-4 years now and they have held up much better to almost daily use.
"Smaller narrower cut than other Kamik's I ordered 1/2 size up because I have wide feet. Still way too tight,  I own another style of Kamik which I have room for heavy socks if I choose to wear, had to return these. Also not good looking in person, but would have kept if they fit."
Boot is wide around ankle and front.  I didn't wear these around the house right  away or i probably would have sent them back.  The boot is nice but the fit is off.  I am not sure if buying a smaller size would have helped.  I took a chance ordering a shoe online because i am familiar with Bandalino brand and usually their shoes are a perfect fit for me.  Now i feel guilty because i didn't go through the process of sending them back. Not a good shoe experience this time.
"although it's sold as fitted, it's rather big"
"**** Update**** 12-28-16

Company refused return!!! Terrible, shoes are terribly uncomfortable. Be very careful, you are NOT purchasing these from Amazon, it is a trick and they have terrible customer service!!!!!! You will not be able to send these torture devices back! >$100 down the drain.

************
Sad, very uncomfortable. Feels like they are on the wrong feet. Sending them back."
"Gorgeous shoes, but WAY too large!  I'm baffled as to why people are saying they are true to size.  They are LARGE - at least .5-1 size larger!  Also, asian sizes have a very large heel and short toe area - this doesn't work for me.  i got 3 sizes, none were wearable due to extreme pain."
Ordered two of these. One looks great and one looks like a plastic gem. Won't buy again
"These have a nice fit and were not real tight. No sagging. They looked nice under my slacks. However, because the toe is not reinforced, I had a runner the first day. Too bad."
"On the plus side they are warm and windproof.

Negatives.
Noisy
A bit oversized in length and waist size, but tight around the legs.
Melt like butter if you get then anywhere near heat. The pictures below show what just touching my piles for a second did. I would stay away from campfires, or anything else that might put you in contact with heat or embers. There is a fire hazard with these pants. They did not just melt, they were nearly set on fire by just a glancing touch to my pipes and smoked for a few minutes afterwards."
"As another reviewer wrote, the photo gives the impression of a small brim on the front. I'm not sure why there needs to be a thin piece of elastic in it. I haven't worn it enough to know if it will last, but I bought a better fitting hat of similar quality on a Manhattan street corner for $4.00."
They were to big so I can't wear them.
"There was no doubt that this was made in China.  The stitching was crooked and threads were loose.  It was so shabbily made I immediately returned it. The lower hem and the pockets were so poorly stitched I doubt they would have stayed in place after one wearing.  Avoid!

On a good note it is as described and sized correctly."
"I have normal-sized feet. Yet, I was not even able to properly try these sandals on. They are too narrow! What kind of feet do they model their shoes on? It's ridiculous."
"The bracelet is pretty, but unfortunately it broke right away. The area next to each side of the bows is thin and breaks easily. Also, the little stones on the ends fall off."
"These are crap, don't waste your money."
TO SMALL AND NARROW THOUGHT THEY WERE WOMENS ....
This is a waste of money
Arrived with a hole in them.  I was able to repair because we needed the product right away.
"Uncomfortable frames and the lenses are awfulmagnification isn't consistent across the lenses and the coating smudges extremely easily and don't clean well with enclosed cloth. Craftsmanship is adequate, but these have a cheap feeling overall. They don't stay on top of my head well, hug the face too tight, and I had to clean them with annoying frequency. Returned."
too small fit
It's not that they were too small. They are just cut so badly that walking in them at all would prove extremely uncomfortable. I sent them back.
If you are larger than a size 10/12 this item will not fit correctly. I am fairly small and I should have noticed in the picture that the line for this robe is straight down.  There is an enclosed tie at the waist which was the only reason that the robe stayed closed at the top. The bottom of the robe will reveal all of what a robe should conceal.  What is good about this is that is a light summer full length robe and priced low.  I think I will return this item.
The pattern on the shirt I recieved was different from the picture. Definitely not as flattering as I thought it would be.
Gorgeous vintage looking pin.  The bow is Marcasite.  It's just beautiful and well made.  Review updated 12-16-17.  Do Not Buy.  The item is beautiful but the very first time I tried to pin it on a lightweight jacket yesterday the clasp snapped right off.  It's Junk Jewelry.  Downgraded my stars to one.
Save your money. I had these earrings for less then a week. First time I wore them I lost the backing but was able to find the actual earring. I then used the backings from another pair of earrings I had. Then next day I lost the other earing. The backings don't fit.
This piece of clothing would be much better with smaller arm holes.
Bought this for my husband and it turned out to be too small. I had read all the reviews and thought it might work but will have to return.
"They look practical, as practical as heels can be. But they are cheaply made and have zero cushioning."
I was so looking forward to comfortable scuba with lots of pockets. But the tops were large on top but tight at the waist I wear everything else in the size I sordered. So this was really disappointing.now I have to send them all back
So very cute and well made...but unwearably uncomfortable.
I did not like the bag as soon as I pulled it out. It was bulky and the material felt very weird in my hand. When you connect the cross body strap it makes the bag appear even larger and bulkier than it is. Plus add in the shoulder straps that will dangle while you are wearing it cross body. It is NOT a good look. I returned it.
"These stones weren't cut to provide shine, as the ones in the picture are.  They looked nothing at all like the photo and had none of the brilliance.  The overall effect was very dull, even when I tried to shine them.  They were also not pink in the least, but more of a clear to light brown.  I would have thought they were a light smokey quartz rather than morganite.  They were also placed in their settings just a little lopsided which gave them a bit of a blob-like shape.  Even the little paper box had become unglued by the time I received it.  I didn't bother trying them on.  The people who gave these a positive review must have received entirely different earrings than I did.

Love love love the photo (I'm still drooling over that photo), but there was nothing to like about the actual earrings except for the free return from Amazon."
"Online looks like a perfect fit, however, too loose and flimsy."
"December 2016:  I like the feel of this chain. It is very fluid, and lies smooth against your skin. It is a nice thickness. November 2017: I originally gave this chain 5 stars. A year later, I changed it to 2 stars, and changed my review. The color is too dark - nothing like rose gold. It is the darkest color rose gold I've ever seen, and quite a lot darker than the solid rose gold on my pendant. When I first got it, almost a year ago, it was not quite as dark. Over time it has become darker, and although I have tried to polish it, I can not seem to lighten it. It also has no sparkle. Now I don't even want to wear it. It's too bad, because other than the color, it is a very nice chain. The photo shows the chain next to a 14K yellow gold chain, and also attached to the rose gold pendant."
"I bought this shoe as a longtime (since the 70's) Topsider customer.  The finish was good the stitching was no problem but the shoes did not fit.  I don't know if it is the style or the manufacture but having worn a medium width shoe forever and the last pair of the Mako style was purchased 6 months ago and the fit was fine how can a medium become a narrow?

I've always told my wife buy shoes in person, I should have listened to my own advice."
Not very comfortable but keep your feet dry.
The shoe has a slimmer cut
veryyyy smallll
Band broke
this was so cute but it got stained really easily and the letters faded very quickly.
"Material feels cheap, zipper pokets  don't open very wide, strap doesn't stay in place."
Fell apart. Cheaply made.
I bought these for my husband and the backstrap broke the first day he wore them. He had to take them to a shoe repair to get it fixed. So disappointing as the service from thi vendor was very very slow.
"Personally, I do not care for the fit of these pants. I say try them out for yourself. they come up high and are not a slim fit. maybe I needed a smaller size but it did not seem that way."
"After reading the rave reviews of the ExOfficio Give-N-Go both here and on travel gear sites, I was underwhelmed by the product after trying it out for a few days.

The biggest issue with the Give-N-Go is that they do not really fit like boxer briefs should. I ordered both a large and a medium, and the large was almost comically loose both in the ""central area"" and around the legs. While I wear a large in everything else, I had to stick with the medium, and even then they are still loose and lacking much support. I believe it is the cut, not the sizing, that's causing this issue. Moreover, there appears to be too much extra fabric in back, which creates problems of its own that I am sure you can imagine. It is also important to point out that the fabric is not smooth, but rather ""waffled"" to an extent. There is one area in which the Give-N-Go excels, however, and that is durability and anti-microbial / odor properties.

If you're looking for a great non-cotton, travel ready boxer-brief, I'd recommend instead the Airism or Airism mesh series from Uniqlo. They accomplish the same thing, but fit like a dream, feel like silk and give you that ever-sought-after ""feels like I'm wearing nothing"" feeling."
"The cups fit perfectly, however the straps barely adjust & are far too loose. The material is silky smooth & it would be wonderful bra if adjustments to the bands were made."
Fitting is ok  but zipper came of from one side.. trying to fix it the other side came off..
Super disappointed. Material was very thin & cheap. I ordered a size down after reading comments still fit huge. Does not look like photo.
"The quality of the material felt cheap and the size was at least a full size too tight. Additionally, there is a small ridge in the back which rubs the ankle. Not recommended."
"I wouldn't consider this a turtleneck. Fabric quality is horrible, the ""turtleneck"" is maybe half an inch long and hangs from the neck. The shirt is very short and loose. do not buy"
Too small not wort h to return cause it took long to be delivered
"THESE GLASSES AND PARTICULARLY THE LENSES SEEMED REALLY SMALL. ALSO, I DID NOT THINK THEY WOULD LAST.
VERY LONG, DID NOT SEEM STURDY."
"Shoulda paid attention to the sizing. The size L/XL came in as an L. Fits more like a girls L, not a women's. I wish they would specify fit more clearly, as in fits L as in girls or fits S in juniors or fits XS in women's. If you wear a size 12 in women's, this skirt won't fit you."
"The color is misleading here.  The purse is actually more pink than purple.  Nice, but color is not true to photo."
"I decided that I would review a skincare product for once instead of my better half. Since I work indoors and am essentially avoiding sunlight for 70 hours a week, I thought I could use some pampering and use some ""skin brightening"". However, my skin didn't tolerate this well (I tried at the back of my neck) - even with avoiding the sun, my skin got pretty red and slightly painful. It did make me nervous because I'm very pale, and if I went out into the sun it would probably hurt very badly.

So I gave up, and threw this in the trash. I mean, it might work for you, but they really need to sell sample sized bottles of this so it doesn't make you feel like you're throwing away $100 worth of product when it doesn't work for you."
"Putting these flips on immediately makes my feet feel like they're sweating. Within a minute I feel like I must be standing in a puddle of sweat. It must be the yoga mat top.

I'm sure they're soft, but the sensation that my feet are sweating makes is uncomfortable and disconcerting.

I have never encountered this problem with my existing Teva Mush flips. But the new Teva Mush flips have been redesigned to include a hard plastic logo under the heel, thus I wanted to give the Sanuk flips a try. Looks like I'll have to keep looking for an alternative to the Teva Mush flips."
"I GIVE IT ONE STAR FOR DESIGN, BUT NOT WORTH THE MONEY I SPENT FOR THEM. ONLY BECAUSE I BOUGHT A PAIR OF POLARIZED SUNGLASSES FOR $10 (SHIPPING INCLUDED) & THESE DONT EVEN COME CLOSE TO THE $10 PAIR.

LENS NOT DARK ENOUGH TO GIVE PROTECTION FROM SUN & I DIDN'T NOTICE ANY DIFFERENCE IN THE SCENERY THROUGH THE LENS, SO I DOUBT THEY ARE POLARIZED"
This neck stretched out and truth I ended up tossing the shirt out.  I got it in white and had the same affect.
I usually wear between a 7 - 7.5 depending on the brand of the shoe.  I ordered a 7.5 and they were much too small.  I ordered these because others had said they had good support but I didn't feel it - and I need it.  I ended up returning instead of ordering an 8 because of the lack of support.  Thank you Amazon for free shipping and free returns!
"It was to big for me, but very nice."
Even though these are labeled as wide calf they are not. Lovely leather but I had to return them.
It's to narrow
Bottom is not banded. Product is not as pictured here. Buyer beware.
"I have bought plenty of Skechers shoes in the past same size, size 6 and these were like a size 5 when I put them on I laughed. These will go back"
"I am giving these shoes a 2 start rating for a couple of reasons.  1. They are way too big.  I normally wear a size 9.5 and after reading all the reviews I ordered a 10 because the reviews said to order a size larger.  I should have tried a 9 instead.  Reason #2. The materiel these are made of do not warrant paying $69.99.  I will admit that I did not comprehend the words ""printed fabric"" on the description.  I assumed that for the price I was getting some type of imitation leather.  I would be willing to pay around $25 or $30 for these, but not $70."
"Cheap one-sided plastic accessory. No alternatives, but you are not much of a lion without it so...I bought it, and it worked."
"I have an older pair of Etnies, in a different style that are soooo comfortable, I wanted another pair. I have plantar fasciitis in both heels, so cushioning is important to me. Unfortunately, I found these very hard and stiff, definitely not comfy. Returned."
"I hoped this robe would fit the way it fits the model in the photo. I dislike short robes that are super short. This one was significantly shorter than shown. It did not reach mid-thigh. I am not overly tall (5'6), so I was disappointed in the length. I really wanted to like it because it is very soft and I liked the furry hood, but ultimately I kept it in my closet for several months and donated it to Goodwill. It might be helpful if their size charts included length."
A little too small. Im normally an 8 exactly but these were a little too small.
The bottom easily falls apart...it is comfy just that the very bottom of the shoes get easily unglued and a little big on my feet.
fits about 1 size small.
awful way too small why make a large option if its just going to come as small
"I have a high instep, and the design of the boot includes a heavy stitched seam at the base of the tongue that cuts into the top of my foot. There would be no way to know this prior to purchase, so if you have high arches, these boots are not for you."
And just on the picture basically. I mean I didn't even need to trial walk in it... I can't even stand in it! First of all the sparkling things come off a lot...I don't like that...but the most annoying thing is that front is so curled up that it's sooooooo uncomfortable!!!!!! I do not recommend it... I expected so much...but I was so disappointed its not even average comfort level. Oh and it's TRUE TO SIZE...
The ordered was XXL . It can fit a 10 year old child. The cut of the coat is all wrong. I am not happy with this product. The color is great.
These shoes are uncomfortable and I wish I could return them. I've only worn them once.
"too small, a different color that I bought was ok .  Disappointed."
To narrow hurt feet at strap and baby toes
"I only wore this twice and the clasp is already broken, it's crappy quality do not waste your money!!"
"Cheap, cheap, cheap and extremely poorly made.  Put the sandal on for the first time last week and the sole came off immediately  as I walked from my closet to the chair in my bedroom."
These socks are cut way too small. I am disappointed.
"I had been an eco fan.  I bought this online and wish I would have bought from a store and tried this one on before buying.  I figured the same size in an eco to what I wore previously would be fine but for some reason this show fit a little bigger than my previous pair of eco.
This shoe was a little more dressy than what I expected.  I was trying to find one like my old pair that was more in between casual and dressy.  I wore my previous pair for dressy occasions as well as casual but these I would not wear any more than for dressy occasions and I take them off as soon as I can.  They do not offer me support like my other pair.
I will say, they are durable which is one thing I really like about Eco.  My previous pair outlasted any pair of business shoe I had ever owned.  I still like Eco but I think I would rather find what I want in a brick and mortar store to make sure I know what I'm getting in looks, in comfort and in size."
"Too small, but looks nice."
"I was SO excited to get these because I had a pair several years ago that were amazing...sadly I was disappointed this time. The fabric was not soft inside and the fit was definitely tight (I recommend sizing up if you choose to buy these). Also, they developed holes in the fabric on my bum, near the seam at the top of my thigh area after I had worn them only 3 or 4 times. The only plus was they do look like jeans and they have real pockets."
Fake levi's. The tag on the back that has the size on it we're mis-sized and the little red levi's logo was missing as well. Do npt buy
"The fabric is definitely different than I expected,  It is stretchy. It is somewhat see through. It is too long for knee length for me and I don't know how to hem this fabric. I would have returned it but it came from Israel and I didn't know what to expect with shipping. I will decide what to do with it next summer. It could be just what someone else is looking for. Just not me. It did arrive quickly and intact."
"These sweatpants would be GREAT if they each had a proper drawstring.  I bought two pairs for my husband for Christmas, and he was delighted to get them.  They are nice-looking and fit beautifully.  Sadly, the drawstrings proved woefully inadequate and snapped right away.  What a bad surprise!  Neither of us has ever had this problem with any of our other sweatpants.  I can't imagine what someone was thinking to use this cheap garbage in making these otherwise nice pants."
"I guess if you know how to read the labeling you'd know that these are NOT cashmere, they are acrylic. False advertisement for sure. As we were looking for wool socks for winter, these will be going back. Very disappointed in the 100% inaccurate description."
"Within a few hours, I had blisters.  The front of the shoes are so tight, not where the toes go, but where your foot goes in.  I had blisters from just walking around on flat ground at the office.  I was very disappointed, as these shoes are super cute and would have been a great alternative to wearing sandals every day in the summer."
Like the dress but it is too big
Love the colors but handle broke a week into using it. We've got kids but still should be more robust.
"These socks are warm, look good and are comfortable- when new, but clearly are not well made and won't last. After just one wash they look like they're 10 years old and warn, and i'll be lucky if they last this entire winter before they fall apart. I guess you get what you pay for... but damn is this disappointing."
It's not black and gold. It's black and yellow. Looks like a bumble bee. Plan to return. Did not wear.
"cheaply made material cheap,"
This was way smaller than I expected and was quite uncomfortable.  Admittedly I've never worn a strapless bra before.
Lace top does not stay up and thigh highs are too short. ( ordered the size I always wear.)  Needed to return the thigh highs.
BreaKS very easy! Huge! Not for small framed women
The zipper jammed repeatedly upon receiving it.  I returned it within one day.  Don't waste your money.
"Finish scratched and scratches VERY easily. If I paid 98.00 id be having a fit

Way too large!  Gave them to my mom and she likes them though
ordered a medium and it's HUGE!! Had to give to my 8 month pregnant sister.
"My daughter is 5 years old, 27 pounds and 38 inches tall.  She is at the very bottom of the growth chart.  She normally wears a 3T or 4T, depending on the brand.  I ordered a size 4T of the French Toast Toddler Girls' Short Sleeve Ruffled Polo.  The shirt was skin tight.  It would have not fit after it had been washed, let alone for a full school year.  I returned the shirts and drove the hour to the nearest retail store selling uniforms instead."
"Well made shoe for the price, but they did not fit my feet well.  The shoes were proper in length and width, however the opening was to large and the elastic band not tight enough to keep the shoes on my feet."
nice shirt -the cut is really small
"Not a big fan of white socks or fruit of the loom anymore,but they worked,but wear out quickly"
"These shoes are cute, but I ordered them twice and both times had to return them because there were mold spots ALL OVER them!  Such a shame because I loved them otherwise.  :("
Order up two sizes
"I really wanted to love these shoes. They're pretty and look comfortable but they were not made for my feet. I tried twice to make them work. First in my size (10), and they were ridiculously small. I even ordered a size up, and my toes were still hanging off the edge.  Alas, it just was not meant to be."
These were even tighter in the calves than the Levi's skinny fit jeans that I previously bought. They also shrunk after washing in cold gentle cycle.
"Had to return, the bust was too small. Good quality fabric. Note the ""white"" part over the chest is more gray cream colored."
"No way the jeans are 33/32, no way. They have  larger legs than a 32 size (by a lot), and are like two big sizes more.
Otherwise, these jeans would be perfect because they are curvy and nice."
"This is a nice looking shoe, but the fit is larger than expected and I even ordered a half size smaller than I typically wear. The quality seems to be lacking even at this price."
"The material is much thinner. In the picture the bottom hem looks slightly ruffled it is not it is just edged with a stitch. The top part in the picture looked ruffled, the garment at the top part is lace. The 3 dangling strips look stupid, but can be trimmed short with out damaging the stitching if your careful. Well a thong does not have much to is as is the one that comes with it though has a tiny tiny triangle of fabric. The garment may hold up for a few wears, and careful washing's."
I thought this was a quality wallet and the cat's meow when I bought it.  Nice thin style and enough room for all the important cards.  1-1/2 years later it is literally falling apart at the seams.
Bad quality. I barely received the purse and it started to peel. And it has too many sequins; it looks very bad. I can't even return it because I live out the United States. I'm very dissapointed.
"Uncomfortable and way too tight to squeeze your foot into. I wear a size 8.5, I ordered a size 9 but still struggled"
Costume like.  Very thin and cheap.  Runs small.  Returned item for poor quality
"This suit looks exactly as pictured and is seriously adorable, but the bottoms did not hold up very well at all.  First, they are high waisted which looks super cute, but they kept rolling down for my daughter once they were wet.  My daughter wore it for a day at a water park and another day at the beach and by then the shiny green part on the back was totally worn off and was black instead of green.  Also, it was very much see through so she could no longer wear the suit."
These were tearing up within a weak of my son wearing them ....disapointed with the quality
I use it just one time and after is broked. I use it to clean the powder. I am very dissapointed and i hope to receive an discount...
"I was buying a 14 and while this is the size I normally wear, these were too small. The material also has zero give. It doesn't stretch at all. I returned the product and tried an XL, which was way too big."
"This hat is so small, I got it for a present and it did not fit."
"Ugly and runs very small.  Not worth it, save your money and time!"
Don't believe the size descriptions of these shirts. They are off--way off. My guess is that they are at least two sizes too small. Maybe more. The material is ho hum. Rather mundane looking actually. I bought them for myself but ended up giving them away.
"If you're tall this isn't for you. I'm tall. And I think this outfit looks better on short people. And one more thing??!! You have to step into this outfit. If you aren't small or petite. You would definitely Tear it, trying to get your torso through it. I"
"The sleeves were very tight... the material was not stretchy at all.... I normally wear a large, but bought an extra large because of other reviews.... I sent it back and did not reorder"
"Very deep ""U"" so that you show a lot of sock, or unprotected feet. They gapped on the sides as you walked. Not good for me. Send them back. Oh, and they made a deep squishy noise because of the insole liner being extra soft. Just wrong for me. For all I know, all this could be good for you in a shoe, but they were sorta short in toe room and yet too large all around."
"These are a really adorable design and both my daughter and I instantly loved them, but after one day running around in them the delicate little designs on the blue background had started fraying and little threads were sticking out all of the inner-facing side of the shoes.  It was obvious they'd be torn up and look terrible in a couple of weeks, so we returned them.  Great idea, but no durability at all, especially for  $35 shoe!"
This was a gift; the person didn't like it so I will be returning it.
Not anywhere near as baggy as the 3180 jeans
"Watch does not run. Garbage watch, returning for refund.

I have other ""cheap"" skeleton watches that are still working after 7 years of use that cost half what this one cost and this one lasted less than 30 seconds.

Amazon needs to weed out these sellers of junk merchandise."
"Nicely made pair of shoes, and not heavy. Unfortunately, as with most manufacturers, the width is good but toe room narrows too dramatically .like most people I have toes, not one big claw in the center. Sent them back  amazon accepted. Thank you Amazon."
They broke while I was trying to straighten the posts so I could wear them. Too late to return.
"Is very uncomfortable, Dont buy this!"
Too loose in the sleeves and collar.  I returned it.  I am 5'10 220.
I did not like these Body Shapers Cami Tank Top because they gave no support at all.  I returned them for a refund.
They were too wide at the bottom for me.
"Ordered the my size and when I got these they said ""one size"" on the tag. Why give me a size option if its one size fits all? Very unhappy."
This item ran small and unfortunately had to be returned. Perhaps a bigger size will be better...
"Don't buy these shoes, size chart way off. Returning is useless. Junk!"
"My wife absolutely, positively loved these slippers BUT they were defective...they had a small tear in the seam where the fabric meets the shoe part.  If not for that, she would have worn them all winter long, so we were very disappointed.  She said that they were extremely comfortable though....it stinks we got a bad draw on them."
"Holes after one wash.  I read a post comparing several different socks, and this was the winner.  Perhaps I just got a bad batch.  However, I purchased these (Enerwear Men's Classics Dress Flat Knit Crew Socks), and after a limited exposure, have been very happy."
"HAHA, this was a joke. I didn't even get the one I ordered, and is this meant for children? I ordered the biggest I could and it couldn't even get my arms in."
"After wearing this a few times with the included straps and washing it...the straps have shred/fallen apart!
A waste of money!"
Looks good on. Light weight. Bifocal area way to small making it diff to focus on objects needing to see. Have to tilt your head way up if driving with them and you need to see numbers exp on your radio or temp. Love the glasses just not functional for me. I did order another pair from another company with larger bifocal area and  they are prefect for me just a little heavy.
I literally couldn't breathe when I tried it on :| I'm usually a small and ordered a small. I need to return this.
They are comfortable  but  I need a much better arch support  and more all over support
Pant leg is too large.
"I normally love Diesel shoes, but this is the worst pair I've owned. The tongue on the left shoe came loose after about a week, and I suspect that it was a manufacturer's defect where the stitches were not properly added. I could probably have them repaired, but what a pain! I should note that I didn't purchase them from Amazon, I got them at The Buckle and had to twist their arm to get a refund."
"Terrible design.  The shoe is a slipper with one piece body instead of opening for foot with a tongue under laces.  I have high insteps and they were nearly impossible to get on my feet, even with my dress shoe-horn.  Right shoe finally on and feels fine, looks great. Left shoe won't go on at all. (not such a great look anymore)"
Not like the Nick&Nora pjs I've been wearing for years.  Rough cotton and I doubt would wash well.
couldn't even pull these up over knees.
"The zipper goes down even when locked down, causing embarrassing situations."
"I like the idea of being able to fold these, but they just did not fit well.  There was a gap on the lower edge that allowed wind to blow underneath them, hence they did not afford the protection I needed.  My refund was prompt.  Thank you."
One earring was bigger then the other
In the past when I have ordered this product they were perfect.  The last two pair I have ordered the waist is so large they will not stay up.  They slide down to the point of making them uncomfortable and also more revealing that I prefer  They will absolutely not stay up in the proper position. The waist would fit someone with a huge paunch. I would like to see the jeans go back to the better fitting waist.. Reviews on their Rider Jeans say the same thing.  Looks like Lee took a good product and ruined it all aroound.  I feel so strongly about this I am adding to the original review.
Cheap. Sean ripped upon first wear.
I cannot write a good review I had to remove my bracelet I was washing dishes with it on and it turned on me on my arm they say you pay for what you get
Fit small and shrunk in 1st wash.
I am looking for a pair of platform sandals and these are not it. They have rivets all around the bed of the shoe and they dig into both feet! They do have a rocking motion to propel you forward as you walk. That is kind of cool but they are very uncomfortable to walk in-no cush or support. Yucky. Try something else.
Not that heavy and easy to stretch out compared to the Gildan
"I'm a size 42 and the L size is supposed to fit up to 44, but I could tell as I was putting it on that the shoulders were too close together and it's too tight around the chest.
I'm not happy."
"I'm 5'4"" and these didn't even reach above my pubic bone. They are unwearable. Soft and cute, but unwearable."
"These are not Pikos.  They are unmarked tops that are made of some clingy fabric like polyester.  I stupidly ordered 4 of them without realizing that they are another fake product from China.  Other distributors call such tops ""Piko style"" so you know you are getting a knock-off.  The price of these is good for a real Piko - or even a fake Piko that is made from bamboo or cotton, but way too expensive for these nasty things."
"My 5 year old, who was about to turn 6 the end of May, wanted a Tron themed birthday party. We bought him the costume and ordered the identity disc to complete the look. Well, I was extremely disappointed when the order arrived because it was a bit damaged due to packaging as the material was so flimsy. It is like the material used to make Solo disposable plastic cups. The plan was to have my son pose with disc for a cool picture, but I was so upset I did it even let him see it. I planned on returning them but the company does not offer free returns and the shipping cost would more than likely cost more than the products. They figure more or less the product would be returned damaged, I guess as a result of the material being so flimsy, so they suggest I pay the extra in postage in order to ensure I get my fund. To make matters worse, we accidentally ordered 2 discs so now I am stuck with 2....definitely not worth it!!!!"
This wallet claims to be suede. It isn't. It is a lovely color and has a soft surface but it is not suede. I wanted suede so it would stay better in the small pockets on my jeans.
I expected a longer sock. The cashmere was very nice but they make it just to the ankle. I like my socks to make it my calf and I am only 5' tall!
Not so great. Rather cheap looking. Will use at the pool that's about it.
The leather felt like a synthetic.
"would love the correct size 33

"I ordered size L and its like a small, the fabric doesn't stretch at all so its not soft."
I assumed and that was my mistake.  Another model of Port Auth was Oxford Cloth. This is a thick poplin.  I got exactly what I ordered and it it a heavy poplin material.  But it is still Poplin and nothing like oxford cloth.  Very Very shallow collar as well. No tie will fit here.
rough fabric and tight fit
Beautiful Dress. Just wish the chest area was able to accommodate larger chested women. I bought a large that fit my body all except for the bust area. My 38 DDD DID NOT fit at all. Disappointed. There's no room to adjust or stretch. The buttons just don't fit across the chest.
"I did not receive a ""spaghetti strap tank"", but rather a regular tank.  And the plus size I ordered was so small it just fit a petite friend. Will not order again."
"I had the bag for 2 months and the strap broke! It frayed completely away at the stitching that connects the strap to the purse. It's a tiny bag too so it's not like I was carrying anything really  heavy that might have caused it to rip and I just took it for my commute to work. I've had $20 purses hold up better, very disappointed."
"The size is too small, and the tummy flattener really hurts because it's so tight in your crotch area.  Very uncomfortable.  This is the same size I wear in other Berkshire hosiery styles."
It was way to bulky for me.
"this sucks...I thought it came with 2 but it's only 1 (my fault) and it just isn't as cool as I thought it would be. The logo on it is unnecessary and of the 2 I purchased, one black(by royce leather) and one brown(by italy morn), I preferred the royce leather brand over this one."
I like the skirt.  But the measurements they give for the sizes to order are not accurate.  The skirt was WAY TOO BIG!
"sizes are inconsistent, company charges for returns"
"pants fit okay, however, super thin.  ordered some other palazzo pants that i wear to work (they are just so darn comfortable and great fabric so they look just like normal dress pants) but definitely couldn't pull these off in an office.  they are yoga pants at most.  comfortable, but inside the house only kind of pants."
didn't fit my son rite an was ichy
"Nice fit, but see through material"
Would have been great if it fit like it shows in the picture.
Product  wasn't as I thought from reading the description. Do not like and probably won't buy again
Can't give it a zero but it deserves one!! Not even close to being the product shown in the ad. I returned it the very next day & I am still being charged for it!!! Bad business
"I purchased this bra likeing the looks and after reading the reviews I thought I would give it a try. When I received this bra it is not true to size and the material was very stiff. I ended up sending this bra back and was very disappointed in it. I would not recommend it and if you do order it you may want to order it in the next size.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Moving-Comfort-Women-s-Helena-Bra/dp/B002T1FWDS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Moving Comfort Women's Helena Bra</a>"
"I had to send this product back twice.  I originally ordered it because the picture shows a back strap on the flip flop to keep it on the foot.  The first pair didn't have a back strap and were huge for the size they were supposed to be.  I ordered a replacement, that didn't have the back strap either, and was still too big."
"The elastic ankle cuffs were way too large measuring 8"" when laid flat. They slipped off the shoe and would have been stepped on which would have accelerated wear and presented a slipping/ tripping hazard if I had not returned them. The lack of any pockets was also objectionable. The fit in the hips and legs was OK."
Almost like cheap plastic shoes. Poor quality
"This shipped and showed up a day late and this leather strap keychain is way smaller than it looked in the picture. Hardly worth $3, let alone the $10 I paid for it."
"very awful , not as described , dolly looking look and feel"
way toooo small and it will be as much to send back as it was to buy
"I'm sorry but this is the first clothing I purchased online that I very didn't like. Very large, baggy, & poorly made. looks better online."
Just to large. Does not look natural
"I am a fit flop advocate!  While this shoe is very cute, it is not comfortable.  The piece between the toes is so rigid, I had immediate blisters.  Wish I knew how to soften up because I love the look.  Company missed the mark on this one.  Booooo"
"OMG, way toooooo short!"
"I received these shoes about 5 weeks ago, and have yet to wear them.  The chemical odor (think kerosene) is very strong. I've kept these shoes outside on my porch, hoping the odor would go away.  They still smell just as awful as ever.  Other reviewers mentioned the odor, but I decided to order the shoes anyway because I don't have a particularly sensitive nose.  I should not have ignored those comments.  This is a very cute shoe, but something this stinky has to be a health hazard and  should not be sold in the U.S..

Order update:  Ordered these shoes Sept2014, it is now April2015.  Never wore them... too stinky.  Put them out with the trash today."
"The dress looked very pretty, but the fit is painfully horrible! I am 5'2 35/26/35 - I ordered a medium because of reviews saying it ran small. I couldn't even get it all the way zipped up because it was so tight, and the arm holes cut into me even without being fully zipped. The design is made to lift the breasts unaturally high, so the sleeve straps are too short in order to pull up. Bottom line - the only part of this dress that wasn't painful and fit well was the actual cup size - I am a nearly B, and it fit snug to show lots of cleavage. Definitely not as expected from the picture. I do not reccomend this dress unless you can afford alterations."
The shirt is the same as pictured but its just a little snug.
"Last year I bought this pair of jeans, this same model in store. The denim is thin and wears great. I thought I can buy the same model over and over again in the same size. But no. This pair of jeans fits different and the denim is thick. I don't like it at all. I returned 1 pair because it runs too big and I am not wearing my other replaced one. Waist of money"
It works but not very well. I ended up ordering shoe stretcher  because this product barely worked
"I've been ordering scrubs size small thru amazon only, but this one was so big that i just gave it to my friend."
"This is nothing at all, what this looks like in the photo. Clearly they have the model holding a handbag to cover up the ""real"" look of the dress, or try to make the dress look so much better that what it does in real life. Crafting of the dress looks like a child sewed this. It has such a plain look, no ruffled look at all. It just looks like some cruddy t-shirt cut up and folded over for the top portion and a cheaply made oversized shirt. They knew what they were doing when they covered the dress with a purse."
This shirt was nor pem press!!  I had to send it out to the cleaner to get it pressed right!!  Is there a 0 star??
there no good they don't do any thing
Love the fit however the main reason I got therm online was store did not have gray in my size however the color was inded a medium true gray. These say gray in description but are actually a taupe shade of tan. If you need a taupe shade of tan you will love them.
Fake carbon fiber
Love the product but so much for the plastic latches.  Mine broke within a month and try to find them on the internet to get yours replaced under the lifetime warranty
"donated it, was too small and almost see through."
The first time I washed these whites keds sneakers the blue padding inside ran.  Now I have one light blue sneaker and one lighter blue sneaker.  The are junk.  Very dissatisfied.
"Horrible, I wore them twice and they are fading and blackening out already. It's a shame because they were really impressive when I received them, but to dull and rust out in less than a month is unacceptable. Don't waste your money here. Unless, you just want to get one to two wears out of them in good condition."
run very small PLUS sent them in off white so I sent back to AMAZON
These pants are in no way as pictured. When they arrived and we opened the package I thought we were sent pants for a 15 year old girl. If I could have given them 0 stars I would've
"The arch support hit my foot in the wrong place. Sadly, I had to return them. Also, didn't like the bronze on black look. They look more bronze than black."
"Though I wear a New Balance 928, these were smaller at the same size.  Liked the velcro though it was too short.  I recommend you try these in a store."
"The dress is too long, definitely not meant for petites"
"I was going to write a glowing review for this one. It is pretty. Nine year old was beyond excited to get and use it. Unfortunately one of the plastic ribs broke after only one day of rain. Extremely disappointed!
Update: I was so impressed with idea of a pretty purple flower and 37"" for a 9 year old that i ordered another similar umbrella by Oak Leaf. Imagine my surprise when i opened the box labeled Oak Leaf and found this same Plemo umbrella with the same broken plastic rib! Someone must have cheated and returned it this way after their return window passed (it did look used) but it tells me that it's a common problem with this umbrella."
"Just like all the over reviews say, the leather loop holding the strap broke after about three months of wear. Sounds like we were a lucky few to get that long out of them. these shoes are now useless as the strap is hanging freely from the shoe."
don't like the size and will be returning.
"The bottom of the bras where it attaches rubs the heck out my skin,I tried everything o cover it so it wouldnt rub. I can not wear them"
This item was horrible please do not order. It is nothing like its competitors.
"The ""Stone"" is more acrylic looking than I would like. The structure holding the stone into the metal cap is a visible black plastic ring which I find distracting. I do like the metal wolf cap."
Very poorly made. Never wore it because it's a tight fit around the arms.
"I bought the 0-12 month for my 7 month old daughter and it was super small on her. Her forearms stuck out the ends and barely went over her belly.

On a plus, it was nice thick and soft material. Wish the size would have worked out better"
"These shrunk quite a bit when I washed them for the first time.  The material is not really all that effective at ""moisture-wicking.""  For what it's worth, the black color of the same make of shirt did not shrink when washed and is slightly better as an ""athletic"" shirt.  As it stands, these shirts, on the whole, are inferior to even a Champion athletic shirt that sells for less at a department store."
Returning today
"I was so excited to see a Luna moth charm and was in absolute love when I received it. Unfortunately, the enamel started chipping away almost immediately from normal daily wear. I would have hoped that it would have been a bit sturdier in construction but it was not the case. I wish it would have just been a solid charm.

Bracelet was shipped in a pouch with the card but not the box."
too  loose
"Arrived on time but these are microfiber, not cotton as advertised.  Pregnancy hormone changes can increase the likelihood of UTIs & yeast infections & 80% or more cotton panties helps reduce the risk.  Since these infections can cause problems in the pregnancy-especially for at risk pregnancies-truth in advertising is especially imperative for maternity items like these panties! The size chart is accurate though-XXL US L matches my daughter-in-law's size L panties.  If only they were cotton as advertised, she thinks they would be terrific."
DO NOT BUY THIS SHIRT!!! It is total garbage! This shirt was hideous and it smelled terrible!. It smelled like salt and vinegar chips!! The picture on the front was barely legible. Total rip off. I'm requesting a refund.
This was too large for me. I need another size.
Wore twice. Already has a hole. Never purchasing again. Too cheaply made.
"While I do like how firm the padding is, the pad shape is narrow and doesn't cover the whole breast, as I'd like it to, resulting in some potentially visible lines in awkward places. I won't buy these again."
They are supposed to be women's underwear but I receive several Hannah Montana ones in my set..... WTH. Very dissatisfied. They are also suppose to be boyshorts and they are not.
"it ""works"" but everytime i kneel down, i get at least one of the ""laces"" that pop out."
"My mother said that unlike the other TEVA she has had before this same model these seem low quality, and leave her bad smell on her feet."
"I don't inderstand why my top is cotton/spandex not mesh..
Very disappointed."
Could not even get my toe in this boot!
Way to large. Tried to return but was informed that I have to pay the postage AND a 15% restocking fee. Which will be over 50% of what I paid. Not worth it.
"Pros:
The company offers free returns

Cons:
-Amazon Prime:  Ordered Dec 12th and arrived Dec 21st.
-These are advertised as one-size-fits-all up to a large. Bought these for my sister for Christmas. She said she couldn't get them past her knees. She is definitely a medium to a large so I thought they would work. Very disappointed."
"I got these for my grandmother. They fit her taste, as she wears mostly gold jewelry and often white or things that match white. She likes them very much but said she will be using with the clip-on earring cushions I bought her since they are comfortable while wearing but cause pain after being removed.

Update: I am downgrading from 4 stars to 2 stars because my grandmother reports that the earrings are even more painful with the earring cushions on, and she can't even keep them on through an entire dinner, with or without the cushions. Also, I saw them in person and they are much larger than I expected, about 3/4"" by 3/4"", not as delicate or as gold gilded as the picture implies. I told her to re-gift them to someone else."
Silver too soft.  Bends too easy
I used to love these slippers but now you need to be careful when you walk other wise you'll leave the slippers behind.  They need just a little more material to stay on your feet.  Bring back the old style.
"Nice shorts but the fabric I can't see holding up.  I'll wear through these fast.  Usually FOL has good stuff, this time questionable."
"This product is not sized as advertised. I am a 32 DD (32 inches under the breast, 37 inches over). When I tried it on and it didn't fit, I took out my seamstress measuring tape, and sure enough, the torsolette measured as a 28 DD."
"I own 4 pairs of these shoes.  For some reason, this particular shoe must not be the correct size, although it does say it is a size 7 inside the shoe.  It is much too narrow on me and the length is short.  I bought another pair from Amazon at the same time I bought these shoes and the other pair fits great.  This pair of Skechers cannot be a true size 7.  The other 4 pairs of the same shoes I own have always fit me great.  That is why I ordered two more pair in different colors.  The shoe itself is a comfortable shoe.  It's like walking on air.  There isn't much of an arch support, but I use these shoes to run my errands and to run around the house in.  I love that you can just slip your foot in and go."
Really poor and cheaply made. Don't waste your money on these socks.
"I followed the suggestions from all the other reviews and ordered 7.5 originally (I usually wear 6.5 for street shoes). Unfortunately, that was a little short. So I returned that pair by paying the returning fee, and ordered a 8.0 right away.
I was hoping to get a great pair and use that immediately in my Zumba class! How wrong I was!!
They sent me a 8.0, an used one!
I can surely tell it has been used, because the lace was not in its original shape, and they forgot about the spare lace that the 7.5 pair came with!
Well, I have to return it again, and I'm not sure if I should give it another chance.
Very unhappy experience.
But, the size 8 was fitting me ok."
"Received these boots, they smelled awful. Even my 3 year old noticed this. We returned them."
"I usually wear a size 8.5, bought a size 9, and still too small. Very disappointed."
Too small. Order half a size bigger than your normal size. But very cute heel!
"I am disappointed with the packaging, fit, and style. It was packaged poorly. The dress was too big and a lot more sheer than shown and described. There were no tags on dress."
"I returned it as soon as I received it. The material is extremely cheap look, I think this is you and not leather. The handle and some of the smaller components like the strap appear to be genuine cowhide, but shell of the bag itself don't have the  characteristics of genuine leather. He is trying to snag and break off. Do not buy this."
Did not work for my purpose.
"It looks cute on the model but fits oddly--it's tight on the thighs but loose at the feet. I'm size 0-2 in pants with relatively thick thighs for someone my size and these were a little too tight on the thighs, although fit perfectly on my calves. However, it's WAY too large on the feet. I have small feet, US 6.5, but there was a good inch or two hanging off my toes. Not a cute look. Probably would only fit someone who has size 00-0 legs and size US 10 feet.
Not to mention the poor quality. I understand these are mere costume accessories but that doesn't mean that they should be thin, flimsy, and low quality."
"Nice shoe, just runs small. I sent back."
Worst thing I've ever ordered online.  Top was huge and misshapen and the bottoms were made for a toddler.
This is a useless product. It is so small that you have to wrench out your credit cards that are jammed in an opening that is simply too narrow.. If they added a quarter inch to the width of the wallet it would work. But as it is it is too slim and too narrow.
"This was suppose to be a large but, it almost doesn't fit my daughter of petite size. She is 5' 4 inches and weighs 120 pounds.
I weigh 160 pounds and 5'7.5 inches. It hardly covers my bottom and waist, top is ok. I wear a 34 c bra."
"its not this pant or seller - Im wearing Buffalo years ago , Noticed there is away difference between Buffalos in the mall
or central shops and the Buffalos that you buying from Amazon , If you expecting original
and high quality buffalos so save your time , but if you could live with lower quality they not that bad .."
"These are not tight fitting capris and for a size medium, they are very large in the waist and hips. I will send them back."
Do not have half sizes. Tried 8 to big  Sending back Order and revived 7 Hope they fit
"Not a bad shoe just weird looking and does gape at the ankle like other reviews I had read stated. I normally wear a regular womens size 10 so I got 1 size up like other reviews had suggested. They were still too narrow and my toe scraped the top of the shoe. It felt pretty comfy other than that so I exchanged them and  bumped up a 1/2 size to 11.5 . They fit much better in the toe area but they gaped so badly at the ankle I couldn't wear them. They looked somewhat like a clown shoe....long and weird shaped and huge at the ankle. If there were a few more holes to lace up the ankle more, they probably would have worked. I ended up sending them back and buying the Sansha Salsette 2 sizes larger (12) .They fit perfectly and are sooo comfortable."
"This shoe looks cute and the fit was good. BUT... to actually walk in it.. no way!
The sole is so thick and heavy, it pulled the shoe off my foot and caused a blister!"
I lost my charm the first day I had it on my keychain. Got them for an out of state friend and I. Disappointed in the quality. Cute though.
"actual size was ok but small toe wanted to peek out of side
love this flip flop style with no back
a style that is very hard to find this year so really wanted them to work!
plus Keen shoes are my most favorite casual shoe
had to send them back!"
Not sure this will make it through one wash cycle. Poorly made and extremely extremely small. I bought the medium for my size 2 daughter and NOTHING is covered on the bottom piece. Barely covers her bum or front. She hated it.
They are already falling apart. They are too tight in the wallet and make it bulky . Won't recommend
"The plastic package said they were 4-6 (Small) but when I opened it up the actual panties were mediums. I kept them anyhow because I figure my daughter will eventually grow into them and the patterns were cute. I washed them on cold because the colors were all different and bright and they were new so I didn't want the colors to bleed and then I dried them in the dryer hoping they would shrink and they did a little bit not small enough to fit her. She is just about 5, thin but tall. They will probably fit her when she is 6 or 7. Is it just me or is it really hard to find panties for 5 year olds? On the hunt again..."
"These earrings looked very nice online, then I got them in the mail. They look horrible cheap plastic and gaudy I am returning them!"
not cute. looks like old lady shoes. returned.
I have a 40 waist but the XL 40-42 is tight.
didnt fit the body right
"Not happy. Discription says DARK. These are FAR from dark!!! You can see your eyes while wearing the sunglases.....even in bad lighting. Some reviewers say they are dark, but what this company is selling now/today, is NOT the same. And they don't feel like true Locs feel. These are cheap sunglasses that you could buy at a gas station. Not worth sending back as I'd pay more. Also, these WERE going to be a gift for my boyfriend, but unless you have a narrow face, these will put pressure behind your ears. I will go back to my other vendor to buy Locs. Disappointed. I have attached a picture (in a dimly lit bathroom) Left the tags on because, I will give as a gift to my nephew instead."
"WHAT EVER YOU DO, DO NOT BUY THIS BELT!!! I COULD NOT GET IT OFF. MY WIFE GOT ON THE KNEES AND TRIED ALL SHE COULD INCLUDING USING A PAIR OF PLIERS. STILL UNABLE TO REMOVE THE BELT FROM THE BUCKLE. AFTER 20 MINUTES OF TOTAL AGGRAVATION FINALLY A FRIEND OF MINE GOT THE DAMN THING OFF."
I got this in the mail and it had a rip in it. It is beautiful but it's a shame it came with a rip. It's pretty noticeable.
They cut into my feet right where the shoe hits (on top) and it is painful.  Do not like them and am sorry I didn't keep the box and receipt to return them.
"These sneakers are not typical Stride Rite quality! Within 2 days, the images of Anna/Elsa fell off. The tongue of the shoe has started peeling where the silver material is and now it's black. Within a week, the shoes look like they're months old and are fraying all over. My daughter says they're comfortable but she's embarrassed to wear them because they look so ratty. Such a disappointment and not what I expected from Stride Rite."
Was really disappointed as the ball to secure it came out without my knowledge (which has never happened to me before) and the black began to rub off and obviously the appeal of the ring was lost and just looked terrible. I returned.
"I have purchased this same style number multiple times and loved it.  This one is apparently not exact, straps cannot be lengthened any longer than an inch and rides up in the back.  it also is flimsier, the lining ripping first wash (and I followed the washing instructions)."
"This set is so cute, soft and fits perfectly! I am so incredibly disappointed that that seam on the arm opened up after just one wash."
Hem stitching is not done the right way.
Very small cup size...will give away.
"I loved my Pebble watch for its notifications.  Which is why I bought it.  But, when I updated my iPhone 6 Plus to I0S 9 and received an upgrade from Pebble, I was not able to use the watch anymore.  All I got on the screen was a picture of a phone and the watch telling me to sync the watch with the phone,  We did this several times but, although it worked for a few hours, the face of the watch always went back to ""sync the watch to the phone"" message.  Eventually, the watch only showed this message when it was plugged it to charge.  Needless to say,  I was very frustrated and disappointed.  I only was able to use the watch for a short period of time and it is too late to return it now.  What a waste of money!"
Shoes fell apart after two wears.
I ordered a size 9. I usually wear a size 10. These sandals are way too big for my feet! I have at least another 2 inches in them. Pretty disappointed.
"Definitely runs smaller than suggested, and oh my gosh was disgusted when I opened the package. It was shoved in a plastic bag and when you opened it, it smelled terrible. Upon further research, it smelt like someone had worn the product before it shipped."
"Runs small, was disappointed in material and make of shirt even ordered bigger size. Made out of a stretchy material."
"As others have said, way too small and way too long.  I ordered two sizes larger than my usual because I wanted to wear gym shorts underneath.  I'm not sure where they sized these, but way off the mark.  And they charge you to return them."
"Cute but very rigid and heavy. Not comfortable.
2 stars for the look."
Purchased for a costume.  Stones kept falling out.
"I washed this due to being so stiff and hard, well the print on the hankie came off completely.  Not worth the buy.  I am very disappointed as I wanted this for my mom."
"So pretty, but hurts way to much for me to keep them."
I bought these to wear to the office every day in a business-casual environment. I found they look looked very stylish and felt comfortable. The reason I do not like these shoes is that they creak and groan. I wore them only around the house for about 1 hour on the carpet. After just that time they started to creak with every shift of my weight or step. It was so bad that my wife thought that I was making the shoes creak intentionally. I purchased a 12M and they fit as expected.
"These shoes were a huge disappointment...they looked so comfortable and nice...but they're not. they just fit ""weird"" and make your feet look huge"
Beautiful shoes but the size chart mislead me to buy a small size
I purchased the X-large for my son. Had to send them back because he couldn't get them over his hand.  Order at least two sizes bigger.
t is NOT ORiGiNAL
"Good med couture quality... TERRIBLE fit.
The pants I ordered were up to my chest, and still on the floor. I'm 5'8"".
The order did NOTHING indicated ""tall"" anywhere and even on the pants itself, no ""tall"" on tags.
These went back"
"Sweatshirt that has been pimped out, not impressed at all."
Showing weird white spots  (different than the shoe) in the wear areas which would be okay if he had worn them more than one time just to walk around the mall. Don't know why they are showing signs 9f wear that bad after light wear one time
"dockers and their sweatshop labor products are getting increasingly worse and worse. stay away from this crappy, poorly made shoe that will weather in just a few short weeks."
"I purchased these for my wife. although she loved the look, they were difficult for her to stand in, and walking was near impossible. ""stand and pose"" is what she said. we returned them."
The bra is kinda padded??  For a DD cup I don't need padding.. And therfore makes it stiff feeling. Wierd
"Pre-shrunk my *ss!!
I washed these in cold, air dried and they shrunk almost 4"" in length!
Bella is a great brand and I love heir yoga pants, but these were a huge disappointment!
However, if you are short (I'm 5'10"") then you may not mind the shrinkage in the length"
I gave these to my kid because they are pretty much just childrens plastic play glasses.
"Not a fan of this premium sock.  I've always worn Darn Tough and Merrell brand premium socks and very well know the difference between a quality sock and an average sock.  I'd always heard about Wigwam, they have a nice website, and they have a lot of choices.  However, I was very disappointed with their product.  The socks were way too big and when I'd remove my shoe, they would start to pull off my foot.  They were also tight around the upper calf, a little itchy, and not comfortable to wear in this regard.  But most importantly...they are supposed to be a ""no sweat"" sock, and my feet were sweating like crazy in these (and this version is considered a light weight sock).  I can wear mid-weight socks by other brands and never sweat at all; so something is definitely different here.  Many people say these are good socks, and everyone is different...but for me they were not good.  My wife bought a pair to try and well, and she was unhappy for the exact same reasons.  I will be sticking with the Darn Tough and Merrell socks that I know I like...I was just curious to try something different; it just didn't work out this time."
"Let's be honest.  This shoes is made of man-made materials.  That being said, we need to understand that the shoes would not feel or breath like a pair made from leather  ---  but the incredible lack of ""breathability"" is insane.  It's like your feet are trapped in Saran Wrap.  The uppers are going to show their plastic base sooner than later with visible creases being apparent after the first day of wear.  I can't believe that these are actually ""M"" width, I feel like my foot is flopping around no matter how tight I tie the laces."
I placed the order for this which was advertised as a small and ordered a small and received a 10-12 which is WAY too big for my 5 year old grand daughter. She was terribly disappointed as there is no time to exchange it before halloween for the correct size. As I paid $35.00 for it and it was advertised as only a small being available imagine my surprised to get a large. Very disappointed.
I expected this item to be of decent quality as this is a Levi's branded product. I immediately returned it when i felt how thin and papery the fabric felt.
Odd fit and shapeless. Returned.
"I hated this bag, but I sold it to Buffalo exchange for almost what I paid for it anyway so whatever"
"This statement necklace looked cute in the picture, but in reality it's cheap looking, very plastic.  The gold chain looks bad and the gemstones look tacky.  I know that it wasn't expensive, but it definitely showed."
"the picture looked beautiful as it is for a baby born rescem found that the size 3 months would be ideal, but it is too small, if I had to buy another choose a size for 6 months."
It's very uncomfortable. Not what I expected it to be
like freakin' jncos with a huge pappy o'daniel inseam.
"The tri blend fabric on this is very nice. It's on the thinner side of a normal cotton shirt, and very soft. The fit, however, is disappointing.

Compared to Next Level's standard-neck CVC t-shirt, this one is comically smaller. A  large in Next Level's CVC shirt fits me PERFECTLY. But  this v-neck Tri-blend looks like it's painted on. I won't be ordering this style again...or be able to wear this shirt. My advice: skip this variety and go with CVC. Or size up at least one size."
"These were the most uncomfortable shoes I've ever worn. Also, the ones they sent me were a knockoff as they were made in China. When I spoke to a wolverine specialist, she stated all wolverine boots are made in the U.S.A. Be on the look out for that.."
"These could be a great boot but the manufacturer created a fatal flaw. The elastic gore on each side is sewn solidly to the inner waterproof lining. As a result the gore is no longer elastic and it is therefore impossible to get the boot on your feet. I ordered the boot a half size large and still could not get them on. The materials and construction appear to be top notch, but that is useless to me now so I returned them."
"These gloves were a bright, garish gold.  Not for me!  I needed something more light gold so I returned these."
cheap and got a hole in it with the first wear
"I followed the size chart on the box. They cut in at the top band and looked terrible, then immediately rolled down and looked even worse."
"A little snug for a large size but cute.l will recommend a size higher,its cotton and does not stretch"
"Had to return. Nice material, but didn't fit my husband. Got the largest size and it was too small (he is 250 lb)"
These were way too big and not too flattering. They also stretched out quite a bit. They're pajama shorts now.
Terrible fabric. Cheap construction. Do not buy this dress.
not what I expected. very small so order much larger size
Very disappointed in this purchase.  Material was on the thin side and was very clingy.  I even went up 2 sizes because I like my sleepwear loose and comfortable.  It was still tight fitting and clingy.  Sending it back.
Gave them away. Never wore them.
china construction !
So dumpy
I am returning this pair of shoes.  I have a pair of Nimbus 16's and had expected them to be more comfortable. Little arch support and none of the cushion I expected.  I will stay with the Nimbus line that I can wear all day and feel like I'm walking on clouds.
Very boxy.  Returned item.
"WAY too large - marked size 0, but fit like a 2 or even a 4.  Very disappointed.  The jeans are gorgeous otherwise - so if you are larger than me, don't hesitate! Just order a size smaller than you usually do."
Not as expected. Not as pictured. Waste of time and money
"Wow given the previous reviews I thought this would be legit but it's not.
I'll give it to to my sister as a gift but it looks very cheap. Even my boyfriend said it looks cheap."
"I ordered wide shoes but they aren't wide at all, the straps also provide very little clearance for your feet so unless you have a fairly slim foot I think they would fit oddly. They are also too far forward on the large size 11 soles. I feel like they're just barely grasping my toes and the weight of the padded sole just pulls them off in weird ways. All in all it was a waste of money."
"First time I put these on, the toe seam busted open."
Constant Wedgie
It came broken! So disappointing
Tight and ill fitting around the knees.  Needs to be stretchy at the knees.  This will hamper walking.
Item was not as shown.  Instead received a bright shiny green corset that looked more like a halloween costume.
"I usually love 1928 jewellery, however one of the red stones fell out of this piece after only having had it for a week. I am still trying to find it."
"Wouldn't buy this product runs very small
Shirt rides up
Very dissatisfied
Feels soft though
Thank you"
Somewhat to large and not fitted even for ordering xsmall.
Junk. Looks like crap.
Like the colors as shown however the issue is these tights cant be worn in summer because it gas a thick lining inside.
"Had a smooth pendent on it and it ripped with one day of wearing it. It split straight up the side. Was very disappointed. I don't play with my necklaces or pull on them, the chain was just faulty."
"Imagine my surprise!  These slacks were purchased for a date, and fortunately, prior to the date, I took the time to remove the labels, including that dumb, size label stuck on the pants leg.  There was so much stickum left on the pants that I could use them for a lint roller!  There was lint, cat hair, etc. stuck to them!  Then, out of desperation,  Washed a brand new pair of slacks before they could be worn, and STILL THE STICKUM STUCK!  That really, really sucks. Called Haggar, and they told me I could write a letter, so here it is!"
Ordered this pair of jeans twice. Both times got a 559 cut in a completely different color.
Would've been nice if the straps didn't come undone every 5 minutes
"Perfect as shown on pictured, but awful sizing. I ordered a size L and they sent a 2XL."
I love what it says but it's not Made to perfection to me the letters looks like they are going to pill off when you wash it so be careful.
Fit was smaller than expect. I ordered a large and it was too small for my brother. And he usually wears a medium.
Pulls down and apart.  Not very flattering.
negative
If you have boobs don't buy it!
really narrow fit
"Extremely narrow! I ordered the wide width and they aren't wide at all. Adorable shoes, but too hard to get on my childs foot."
Thin see thru  scarf like  material.. poorly made!!!! OVERPRICED!!! FABRIC MADE LOOKS NOT LIKE THE PICTURE
"I ordered the same size in these bras as I do in every other one, but after one wash, they shrunk and are now too small. They don't look very flattering and like many others said they are itchy and uncomfortable. The price is good, but not worth it if you can't wear them!"
"I don't like it when somebody says something is cheap when talking about Halloween costumes because they all tend to be cheaply made, that's just how it goes. This on the other hand, was very cheap. And I'm only complaining about it because both...BOTH! of the straps broke on me during a Halloween party. Luckily I had some safety pins, but it was pretty disappointing."
This one is not true to size. Have to return it. Yet another one I ordered is perfect
I bought these for my son playing JV soccer for fall. They fit as expected and were comfortable. Unfortunately they ripped out on the edges in less than 30 days.
"the shoe is amazing, the seller is total opposite."
"Go to You Tube and type ""How to tie a necktie"" in the search box or better still type ""Windsor Knot"" in there.

Even the worst You Tube video on this subject is better than this book. In fact I recommend that you copy the search terms above now and go to You Tube rather than waste money on this book.

If I had relied on this book to teach me how to tie a Windsor knot in a necktie I would have given up long ago.

The instructions make little sense. I only paid a dollar for this book but believe me it's not worth even a dollar. Oh yes it does show 14 ways to tie but most of them you will never use. You only need to learn two types of knots. The half Windsor (easy) or the full Windsor (difficult). They do have a section here on how to tie a bow tie but I sure would not want to try it using this book's description."
"These are extremely large pants, both in leg width and height. Just be aware. I'm normally a medium and ordered that and was swimming."
"Pants felt great, love the material. Great color too. Very light weight. Unfortunately... i'm a big guy... ordered the 44x32... when trying them on, my legs were tight, and the butt was tight. The inseam was great, didn't feel too baggy, but they just wouldn't, even with the elastic waist band, they felt more like a 42 EXPANDING to a 44 rather than a 44 expanding a little more room. I have another pair from a different manufacturer, heavier material and not as nice... but fit far better. REALLY wanted to like these but can't. This review is solely for the fitting, nothing more,"
"I used to get underworks products from a company out of florida and they were amazing. This stuff now, come's from over seas... quality is cheap, sizes are way off. Material is the worst"
Having pain in my instep and it's driving me crazy.
So comfortable.  Light weight but good support
returned it because it was defective. otherwise it was a cute suit although very expensive.
The fabric was very thin. You get what you paid for.
The heart was pretty big and heavy. It ended up hurting my neck and I thought it would have the design all around but it was like a heart cut in half.
Disappointed........I bought these in brown and loved them but these in black just kept rubbing the top of my toes to where I couldn't walk without pain. I have the brown ones in this style and the Chukka boot as well and both fit fine. Thanks to Amazon for the return. I'm going to have to find a black comfortable casual dress shoe that comes in widths.
"This took almost well over a month to arrive. When it did arrive I was very disappointed. It does not look nowhere as cute as in the picture. the dress is more of a square shape, meaning more on the boxy side. It is long, which I liked, but the colors are dull and it gives off the look of a moo moo. The martial is very thin, which by looking at this picture it seems thicker.  Right away I noticed that they dress sleeve was covered in black maker, that must have soaked through whatever they were writing on.  I contacted the seller, and they agreed to return it, but I decided it wasn't worth the effort, given I only made 14 bucks. I will just cover it with a cardigan and use the dress to wear on play dates or as an outfit to wear around the house on lazy days. Do not get if you want what's in the picture, that is not what you are going to get."
"This fits very oddly.  I have a normal size 10 torso.  Not long-waisted nor short.  When I put this on, the first thing I noticed is that the bra area was about 3"" lower than it should be.  I pulled it higher and tried to use the straps to keep it up, but it simply pulled on my neck and was very uncomfortable.  The back strap was so large and loose that it had no purpose.  The cute straps are actually ten individual straps that you need to gather together and then tie them. I suppose if you are short-waisted and have a very broad back it would work for you providing that you don't mind all of the straps.  The fabric is cute, it seems to be well made, but I had to send it back."
"Unfortunately, the insides of this wallet are already splitting. :("
"No wonder it's cheaper than others, the foam on the bottom is not cushioned well."
The quality is horrible on this outfit. It looks like it's made from a cheap stretchy dance uniform material. Not pleased at all... Maybe I will turn in into a Halloween costume so that my money isn't totally wasted. I would not recommend that anyone purchase this. The skirt doesn't even have the band on it as pictured... it looks like a pillow sack or something.
"Seem fine, but too small.  Asked for a return before the window closed, but the return never process.ed"
"could not even fit my foot into one shoe! i am usually a 6 1/2 to 7, i orderd a 7 1/2... Zipper was diffcult to zip down.. never even took other shoe out of box.. return for refund."
Just not my fashion.  The only real bad thing was they were so straight that Sun was coming in the side way too much.
Fit was too small and too much trouble to send back
Ive only worn once. It looks like pajamas and the pocket is obscenely huge. Its too big to be just regular loose fit. Not flattering.
"These boots are cute to look at , but they don't look like they will last very long, and for the price I would think they would be a little thicker rubber - also there are no pull up straps on the pair I got, so they are a little harder for a child to put on.  The only real positive is they are Thomas, and that's what my grandson loves.  Here's to hoping I can still be happy with this purchase a few weeks from now. If you are ordering these, order them a size or two bigger than your child would normally wear, since they run small."
I wasn't impressed with the black crochet. The comfort wasn't there either. Returning.
"I only gave these one star because Im not sure if my review would have registered with none. I bought these for my husband on February 15th. Yesterday, March 24th he discovered a whole in the top of the sneaker material. In my opinion, sneakers should last more than one month! I have returned them. Thank goodness I bought them thru Amazon so I was able to get a full refund. I have noticed that there are other reviews that have experienced the same issue. Obviously, there is something wrong with the sneaker construction. I would NOT recommend this sneaker!"
"Both of our girls (ages 2 and 5) received one of these dresses each as a gift.  They were both so thrilled until my 5 year old tried it on and it was WAY too small.  Hers had to be returned.  The dress is one size and seems to be about a 3T, maybe a 4T.  My 2 year old wears 3T and it fits her nicely.  Here are the pros and cons:

Pros:
The removable skirt is great since it DOES fit my 5 year old so they can share the one dress (since it's really a dress with a detachable skirt)

Cons:
Runs small and only comes in the one size.
Quality is horrible.  We've had it a month and it's already fraying.
The dress when worn alone without the detachable shirt is VERY short (mini skirt length!)
And my biggest complaint, which is my I'm writing this review, is the plastic brooch sewn onto the neckline is a STICKER on plastic.  Since it is sewn onto the dress, it is not removable.  I had not noticed this was just a sticker of Sophia (instead of it being screen printed onto the plastic brooch as one should expect) until I was pulling it out of the wash machine and saw the sticker had peeled off into tiny little balls and my 2 year old gasped.  How gross that I can't wash this without it being ruined further!  All because they were cutting corners by using a sticker on a piece that is sewn on!  Urgh."
They're fairly short and ride up a lot. I love the material but it rides up just under my bottom and doesn't serve it's purpose as a slip when it's that high.
"Seemed like a quality bra. Got it half price of what it was listed at the time, an Amazon special offer. Just wore it yesterday the cups are slighly too big for me, could live with that BUT the side vertical supports (plastic bar?) under your arms dug into my rib cage near the bottom and by 3pm I couldn't wait to get it off. This is the second time I was fooled by a normally quality product, ""on sale"" at Amazon."
I did like these boots till i went to pull them on and the whole top ripped off. i hope they replace them.
"The black pair fit a little loose but not too loose that I would return the shoe.
  The burgundy was looser than the black pair. I would exchange this shoe for size 10-1/2 narrow if it was even exchange. Your web  site is now showing the same shoe for $35.00 more than I paid. I have not worn the shoe yet. If you would make an even exchange, I would do that."
They were too big and I could already see how the leather was rubbing off of the bow.  They wouldn't have stayed cute for long.
"Succinctly put, the three reasons why this wallet is useless to me are: it is uncomfortably large compared to my old Dockers wallet, the card pockets are so tight that it is impossible to remove cards and IDs quickly or easily, and the lowest two card pockets are the same depth so that the card in the bottom pocket will cover up the card in the pocket above it rendering one of the four slots per column useless. There is about a centimeter of leather projecting pointlessly above the top of the wallet. If this wallet had been designed with three larger card slots per column for a total of nine slots I'm sure I would have liked it much better. As it is, my old wallet is far superior and I'm stuck trying to stretch out the card pockets to make the Alpine Swiss a little less useless."
Fabric seemed more light weight and not as nice as a Columbia vest I purchased several months ago. Sending it back.
Does not match up with size chart
Way too small. Not at all the size it describes. But good quality.
"I have GMS thong and bikini swimwear and never had a problem with size.  I enjoy them a lot.

These were way to small and very uncomfortable to wear. Into the trash they went. Dissappointed.

PS. They were not GMS labeled."
This style is very cute and matches this pictures.  The material is soft and it would have been comfortable for the time I wore it.  However the 3XL is should be consider on as and 1XL or at least 2XL.
"Didn't like the fit, and the sleeves are odd - the design is a completely different silky fabric, looks like its just been added as an afterthought."
I ordered a 24 inch and received a 16 inch.
"UPDATE:  The outfit shrunk quite a bit after being washed once.  Would advise not to put these clothes in the dryer unless you want them to shrink up.  Also realized the onsie is a 6-9, but the pants are 3-6.  This is quite irritating since it is supposed to be an outfit.  Pant legs are different lengths as well

I have several newborn and 0 to 3 month Gerber clothes and they are tiny. I read and heard Gerber tends to run small. I ordered 2 outfits 3 to 6 month size, and they are as big as some 12 month clothes (width and length). The outfits themselves are super cute. I ordered the dark blue with the daisies"
Not much for support at all
"Quality is terrible. When they arrived the first thing I had to do was trim loose threads from where they hemmed to keep the yarn unravelled.

They're too small, and I have thin arms. Unless you're really petite and small and almost certainly female, they won't even come close to fitting. They would work for a child or young teenager.

Nonetheless I plan to use them for the time being because I need something to keep my hands warm and my fingers free due to Raynaud's. If they don't fall apart like I expect and/or loosen up a bit to fit more comfortably from use, I might add a star. Maybe. In the meantime? I can't recommend these.

UPDATE:
3 months later, they're falling apart something fierce. There are two holes between two different pairs of fingers. There was three holes at one point, but I mended one of them. The hem is completely undone on one, and it's probably only a matter of time before that one straight up starts unravelling. I haven't even tried washing them yet because I'm afraid they'll fall apart completely (fortunately, they don't stink and aren't stained). I don't even use the gloves daily most of the time, only when it's cold.

Dropping a star. I would have expected these to last at LEAST 6 months before really beginning to disintegrate despite the poor quality when they arrived."
stiff & it rubs all over your foot. vinyl material. should have known not to buy cheap sandals. but i thought how bad can it be there is so little material touching your foot.. they hit the garbage after 30 minutes. decor on top not even glued on right. instead of curving with the top of your foot its straight. not worth the money to send back.  the foot bed is not bad. but you could never walk very long without blisters. save your money
None of the colors pictured were included in the package. I specifically purchased these for the color assortment pictured and the product was not as pictured.
"So small...Sooooo soooo small
This is a joke! The fabric is horrible, and the sizing is for kids!"
it shrinks even on low heat in dryer
I gave it to my niece. Cost to much to return.
"i like koh koh dresses a lot but this was a total miss.  there is a review saying they are 5'11"" and the dress was long enough for them.  I don't know what happened to my dress but it wasn't that long.  i am only 5'6"" and the dress didn't even touch the top of my feet, it hit slightly below my ankles.  also, the top portion was just huge.  i am a 36B and ordered the medium.  there was just way too much fabric and since it was so loose it kind of billowed and was very unflattering.  returning!"
"Rolls up around my waist. Doesn't stay flat down and becomes uncomfortable with the bulky roll at my waist. Must stay standing for it to function as it should. As soon as you sit, it climbs up and bunches around your waist."
This design is very narrow and short compared to the other volatile sandal.  I do not recommend this style if you have a wide foot.
"This earrings broke soon as I tried them on poor quality,,will not order from them again.."
"I had to return they run small,I returned them"
Feels nice but not happy with the color. It is more of a peachy/salmon than a pink. The picture shows more like a hot pink thats the whole reason i purchased it.
"Quality counts, even in panties.  These are thin and have that shiny look.  I threw these in the garbage . Sorry Hanes."
"Very uncomfortable, pure quality  ,material like paper  card box"
"The package was labeled wrong. On the outside of the package it said XL, but the capris were actually 2XL. Way too big. I am returning them."
Fit was small. My jeans are 8 and they are comfortable. These are tight
Had these shoes for a month and the bottom peeled off. Did mostly trail running and paved path nothing extreme. Pretty disappointed in these and will go back to Nike.
"It's broken when my husband were first time
had to return"
"It was a pretty ring, but 2 stones fell out after 3 days of light wearing. Stones are not secure at all, just barely glued in."
"I ordered the grey one, when I got it it's like a mix of brown, yellow, and greyish color. What the heck? It is not the beautiful grey color as shown above."
Way too big. I was going to order a medium but according to the size chart I was a large. I probably could have fit into the small.
The wristband is way too long for any common women's wrist.
"This is not a style that will look good on someone who isn't as skinny as the models in the photos.  They cut away in the middle of the back strap leads to ultimate side boob.  The lining is cheap and clingy, not to mention pretty see-through.  The lace itself is lovely, but on my body it looked cheap.  I bought this to wear to my birthday party, but I tried it on when it came in the mail and immediately decided to go in a different direction."
Its toe is so tight even a bigger size. but it is cute especially the pink one. be careful about the size.
Shameful. Very poor quality.!!!!
"Good price. Good material. Not designed for short girls. I am 5 foot 2"" this dress is so long it goes way beyond my knee, to a tea length dress. It extends about 6 inches below my knee. I would recommend this for somebody who is 5'7"" and taller"
SOME OF FLEECE IS ALREADY COMING OFF
"Another disappointment. They look nice but they don't stay latched. I had to keep  latching them and literally found them in my hair and on the floor. I will no longer order jewelry from Amazon. My boyfriend bought me a $500 watch would never tell him this but I would not pay that much  for it. Every piece of of jewelry has been disappointing. Don't buy what you can
 not see with your own eyes."
When these shoes arrived I immediately put them on and they fit very well...super cushiony. I wore them to work the next day. I work on my feet and after 8 hours the top part of the sandal rubbed my foot raw. Very disappointed.
"It's cheap, you get what you pay for in this case"
"Honestly, I avoid these in my sock drawer. Why haven't I thrown them out? Sometimes they are all thats left in my sock drawer. They invariably slip off a few times on each foot everytime I wear them. While I want invisible socks, I don't want bunched up at the bottom of my shoe socks."
Don't like the way looks on my hand
This bra cup was no where near a DDD. I range between DD and DDD depending on fit. I have NEVER had a DDD be too small! Inaccurate cup size. This was a DD fit. I was overflowing from all sides.
WAY WAY WAY TOO SMALL!
The wallet was of the highest quiality but the product was to big to fit into any of my pants or suit pocket. It needs to be smaller in size and keep the function.
NO IS GOOD
"Belt itself is built nice and holds a decent amount of money, it's also comfortable. Problem is the buckle is made of pretty cheap plastic and broke after about a month. Fortunately it survived the trip I originally got it for, but not far beyond that. Given that these things are built for trips you should be able to expect at least SOME durability"
lee change the material. did not like these jeans at all. returned them. too stretchy. did not fit right.
I really liked this shoe but I tried it in two different sizes and it runs extremely small. Unfortunately I had to return it twice.
"wore this 3-4 times,washed it twice in luke warm water at delicate setting..I have cut other threads  water,thought it was a fluke, but noooo.. another thread is unraveling...look at pic..c'mon Huk..and I bought a number of Huk products..the stuff is not cheap..made in Guatemala?...ah-ha..make it cheap-sell it high..and don't ask me to send it back..it's a pain in the arse..just do it right the first time..annoyed.."
"who the heck are these people, that say they run small. I order the 7.5 ( Aussie sized), and my American size is a 6. They were a full size too big. and the cuff, was 3 sizes too wide. and they are lightweight, nonwaterproof, and very CHEAP. I mean very cheap. Think cheap even for walmart- cheap. They are 10 dollar boots- at best. I would never use for actual skiing, or snow weather. They are truly winter-style fashion boots. PLEASE do yourself a favor, and DO NOT BUY THESE.

It's better to spend $70 bucks for TUNDRA,BOGS, SOREL, than $30 for absolute junk. I put my foot in them, and returned them. ASAP.  Not worth giving another second.

AGAIN, spend on the better brands, and leave the chinese knockoffs, for hair curlers, seriously."
"Runs way too big! Can't even wear it. I am 5'4"" and 120lbs."
My son wears a 13.5 in Nike shoes. Ordered a 13 and the r about 1.5 inches too big! Cheap sole. Not a quality product..but u get what u pay for.
The fabric is already tearing in some places and I've only worn them 10 or so times.
"I loved the boot but had to return it because it doesnt fit.
I have a true size 11 foot and the size 11 boot didn't fit at all. would probably need a 12 but its not offered.

Can't provide any reviews to the quality or durability"
They bunch up.
loved the color and the style buy they were too big around my ankle. i had to return them!
I'm totally unsatisfied. I received my dress and opened it up. Some of  the little rhinestones weremissing and also the rhinestones were just scattered and crooked. It was just a bad bad purchase. I'm not happy at all. I don't think they inspect before they ship.
Very loose fitting.
"I try to buy only 100% cotton sweats. For that reason I ordered these in black which at the time was the only color available in 100% cotton. The material is fine. I ordered large based on the sizing guidelines. It was too large - especially in the length. Since 100% cotton is hard to find I decided to wash them in hopes of them shrinking. They shrunk a bit, but not much. I then ordered a pair of mediums. They are also too large, again especially in the length. After washing, the large and medium are of almost identical size. So the sizing of these pants seems very sloppy. However my primary complaint is with the elastic waist. The elastic is not strong enough to hold the pants up. It does have a built in rope, but it's not elastic and therefore not comfortable. I give it 2 stars only because it's 100% cotton."
"This was a nice, soft robe but the pockets were way too low ...it was just too large for my husband."
"Sorry, too limp for me.  I prefer a bag that can stand on it's own.  Nice material and well sewn, though. This bag has been returned."
Some inexpensive clothing is a great deal. If you don't mind polyester I guess it's okay. I hate it. Oh well.
Ulgy shoe good thing it was bought by a begging friend who didn't mind looking like a duff
"I love Nine West, and I know to order 1/2 a size up with more narrow heels.  Which I did, however this shoe is tighter and more narrow than any of my other heels.  My feet are killing me after an hour in them.
I used to have the Ambitious Synthetic pumps, which were super comfortable, but I can't find them anymore.  This was not a good replacement."
these are too small and too short and arrived with a broken zippper
"I was hoping to replace a pair of delicate and chic diamond cut hoops i had lost earlier this year. These were cheap and costume-y looking, even for the price. The hinge keeping the earring on your ear was one of those that--pardon my description--you thread the hook through a large hole and then it springs into place. This clasp made it look even cheaper. Returned"
"Poor quality to be honest.... The spanner is absolute trash, the screw drivers fell apart after 1use. I cannot recommend this kit."
"i've read many reviews about this
i got excited and now a'm very disappointed
its large and doesn't fit my wrist"
This is a really cheap looking costume. We take Halloween and especially pizza paraphernalia really seriously at our house and this costume did not live up to our high expectations. Wouldn't buy again or recommend this product.
material and size are not correct. material quality terrible and the size is two sizes smaill.
SMELL BAD!!! AND UTS PLASTIC!!! I AM ABOUT TO RETURN BECAUSE TO SMALL WVEN I DID CHOOSE BIGGER THAN MY SIZE
"These shoes are so cute but the toe is too narrow and pinches and the heel strap is too big and loose, so I had to return them.  So sad."
"These are bloomers by no other term , I ordered my size so maybe two sizes smaller would fit . I wore them under a summer knit dress and they were all bunched up on the butt .. They remind me of my mothers bloomers or the ones I wore when I was pregnant"
I paid way to much for these. I was so dissapointed. The a lagging made it worst. The boots were folded in half so the fringe is sticking straight up 
Not for tweens...
"I'm surprised this got so many good reviews, the leather looks and feels really cheap."
The sole of the slipper was so hard.  I need slippers with cushion.  I had the slippers on for 30 minutes and had to take them off.  My feet ached for the rest of the day .  I gave them away.  Very disappointed for the price I paid.
I liked the color of these jeans but in comparison to the other 3 pair I bought (the same size & style) they ru very small. Sent back for a refund.
I normally wear a size 16-18. I bought this pair in a size 18 and when I tried them on the thigh and butt was too big and the waist was close to 2 sizes to small. Definitely don't recommend these
"Ive owned 4 pairs of these shoes. They average a year to 10 months of wear. Outdoors landscaping and heavy equipment operating. The last pair soles separated easily in places. If you walk in grass with morning dew, you have wet feet in shoes not even a month old. Im done with the shoe after that. Wet feet are unacceptable."
"I really wanted to love this romper as it was just so cute in the picture. I am 5' 7"", 143lbs and usually wear a size 4-6 so I initially purchased a large. It was way too small and barely covered my tush and fit really awkwardly over my chest. (I am also a 34DD) I decided to order the extra large and I am only marginally more impressed. It does cover more of my behind, but the front is still a bit awkward over my chest. I expected to need to pin it, but both that and putting a tank top under just doesn't seem to look right as the material is so thin you can see every gather and fold. I know for the price I shouldn't have expected much, but I have to been much happier with other clothing items I have purchased on Amazon. Still trying to decide if I should send just the large back or both the large and XL."
I normally wear a size small but from the reviews I ordered a large.  It is still skin tight and is miserably tight in the knees.  I won't be able to wear these.  Very disappointed.
"The small size I ordered was still too large. Based on other positive reviews, it is possible that I was sent the wrong size. However there is no way of knowing this, as the size isn't labeled on the bra.
Not effective whatsoever as a sports bra."
"Shoes are very soft and very comfortable, but should wear them with socks in water. They gave me blisters where the tongue is attached to the body of the shoe just by trying them several times on dry feet. In water it may become a wound. I returned the shoes."
"Really disappointed with the appearance of the Firelily in black leather. As another reviewer mentioned, the front of the shoes looks scuffed. The overall pattern seems flawed in the front of both shoes, which is probably why the price was lower than usual. I do wish when shoes are factory seconds that it would be clearly posted in the product description - sometimes factory seconds are great and worth the discount, but other times the flaws are hard to overlook even with the lower price."
"Had to return, too wide."
Did not like the material but it worked well with the garment.
didnt' work
I had this set of three pairs of white Flip Flop socks on my Christmas Wish List. I wear them all the time with my flip flops. After receiving these socks I wore them and washed them no more than 4-5 times. When I put on one of the pairs I saw that a hole had worn out in the bottom of one of the socks. I was shocked that the quality was so poor.
"the chest part fit fine but the bottom flared out way too much and the length covered pass my butt and I'm 5'3"""
What a bummer
Nowere in description did it say they were strechy. What i recieved has a strechy effect.
"model is great,but small to be an 11."
Tiny and the closing started to tare
"Unfortunately I didn't like the watch on MY WRIST. One this I have found about Amazon is I read the reviews but then I order things if they appeal to me. It is really plain and I was looking for something with a bit more ""jazz"" to it. I think it would be great as an everyday watch. Once again I recommend people read these reviews to get a perspective but order it and send it back if you don't like it. Amazon has such an easy return policy."
"This top does not match the photo on the page.  It is a LARGE white, long-sleeved t-shirt with a band around the bottom and slim arm holes from the wrist to about 5 inches above the wrist.  The pockets are not really pockets - I cannot fit my hands into the pockets and I definitely wouldn't want to keep something in this pocket.  I am 5'0"", 145 lbs.  I usually wear a small or medium, but this product encouraged ordering up a size.  I wouldn't.  The large is very large.  I have requested to return this item."
You don't get whats pictured and the size is large not one size fits most
"I just received these today. This is the second time I've ordered socks from TIE BAR. The first time I ordered, they were garbage. And I posted so in my review. So I decided to give em a second chance. Big mistake !! I figured with argyle socks I couldn't go wrong. Anyway, long story short, they are extremely thin socks, not intermediate as one review said. But, the worst part is that they poorly constructed. Either the worst seamstress or machine that's ever been used in putting a pair of socks together. So save your money. There are other good socks on amazon that you can get. Which is what I am going to do. Oh and yeah - there's also the money you would throw away. These are not cheap. They cost me $9 plus $6 shipping. That's $15 !! And if your anything like, with work and a busy life, who has time to spend to have to ship this garbage back."
"I was very pleased with this shoe the first month and then noticed pieces of the sole breaking off. As of today, four months later, the upper portion of this boot is still like new but the bottoms are falling apart. The treading is still in great shape, but breaking off in chunks as well as between the treading of the shoe. I was very disappointed with this product, since this is a reputable product and my expectations were high. This is the second pair of boots I have purchased within the year. If you are on your feet and walking a lot, I would not recommend this product."
I ordered white but i received beige why i don't know. I did not like at all very light materiel .
I don't like the fits it's to large
"Way too small. Ordered size 34. If you're a 34, this will not fit you."
"This sandal is not for wide feet. It squeezed my foot and was very uncomfortable
to walk in. I sent it back."
Can't not handle the smell of the cloth.
"I feel the sizing is off. Yes, the material is designed to be stretchy but it was way too small to be a comfortable fit. I will be returning mine."
Very thin fabric. Order one size larger than you normally would!
Fits like a 3X not a 4X plan on sending back
These were very narrow in the toe and ran much smaller than any other Skechers I have had. Had to send them back.
I only have a small pooch in my tummy region and these made it look huge. I looked like I was 6 months pregnant. Definitely returning.
"Worn it for a week now and love it! I've gotten many complements! So far so good 

***Update, well this ring is sadly in the trash. I had it for about 3-4 months, the silver has tarnished around the entire band and all the prongs, one prong broke, and the center stone is very loose and spins. I bought this as a temporary ring to wear in place of my acts wedding rings because my hands are swollen from being pregnant. I have to say I'm still torn on if I'd purchase again or not. I LOVE the style and fit but I didn't think it'd go in the trash so soon."
"I received this bag as a gift. Same great quality.  A friend saw it and bought one just like it in a different color for travel.  Unfortunately, the metal clips that attach the strap to the bag are as heavy as the entire bag and defeat the purpose of having a lightweight bag.  These heavy metal clips are so heavy that they keep the top of the bag folded over so that it takes 2 handa to open/close the zipper & you have to hold the clip straight up to get anything in the bag.  There needs to be a better way to attach straps to all Baggallini's.  The less heavy unnecessary hardware, the better.  The heavy metal clips can also break or damage property if it hits just right.  It seems that all straps on the crossbody bags should be sewn into the bag fabric where it can be to avoid the extra weight.  Other than this, it's another great Baggallini."
Wrong item received.
to small. my baby girl is 6 month. and the dress that i order is 12 month but it look s for newborn baby for 1 month. i am disappointed for this product
Bought this item in error
"This does not ever dry... At some point, it could end up smelling moldy if you use it after a bath so don't.
Strictly a dry robe. But cool if you're trying to look like a Jedi like my son did."
"The print looks very nice, however the shirt was extremely large.  I looked over the entire shirt and there is not a single label on the shirt that states a size, so I am certain that they sent me a shirt larger that what it was supposed to be.  I will not use the seller again when I purchase."
"I purchased this shirt for my four-year-old who adores Curious George. I ordered the size five to be on the safe side, but was upset when I received this shirt. The shirt is surely wide enough for a size five, but the length of it was correct length for my 20 month old. It's completely unusable and I have a very disappointed little boy."
"The material is itchy under the arm, this may go away with several washings, but my skin is sensitive. Plus the fabric comes up to high under the arm when I adjust the straps to provide better cleavage cover. I'm a nurse and hoped to find an under shirt that will hide my high cleavage from patients, but this isn't it."
Should have listened to others. My almost narrow width foot was not even completely on the shoe. Really wish they could make the sizing and fit more standard. I have seven pairs and have had to return just as many. If you have a narrow foot buy these shoes.
the stripes are sewn crooked in the back of it good thing I have a large Kim Kardashian booty so I can pull it up a little sideways and that won't show but the material is good the only problem are the stripes don't line up in the back
The fabric is odd - like a gauzy blouse. Runs very small.
Bought 2 pair. One of them came very warped. They are very delicate and feel pretty cheap (then again they are). I returned and bought another pair that was a couple dollars higher and substantially better quality.
"very cheap, thin, terrible material. worst quality i've ever seen in a halloween costume! this would even stand up to a night of trick or treating."
"The size says 3T/4T so I expected this to be really big on my small 2.5 year old. It actually ended up just fitting him so he won't be able to wear it for as long as I'd hoped. The stitching was also done very poorly. Many loose strings and a hole on the seam of the hat. It will work for play, but I wouldn't order this again or recommend anyone else order it."
"I don't like this bag.  I regret taking the tags off or I would return it.  It is big and sloppy-feeling to me, and it is also too heavy for me."
These look cheap
"I have bought Speedo water shoes before,(a different style) and they fit well. I go through a pair about every three months. But this pair are way tighter than any other pair I have bought. They rub the top of my left foot to were I have raw spots."
Did not fit on my Pandora bracelet with heart clasp.  Returned.  The return was easy and refund was quick.
not tight at bottom fit uneven bust size to bottom
these socks do not stretch at all so if you have large calves it's not going to fit correctly.
"The boot, around the bottom of my ankle, is caved in and not easily straightened out... these are shorter boots.. only go up to about half of your calf..."
cheap and bad product.
Stinky bracelet. I will be returning it.
Arrived thinner & much smaller than expected.  Returned this shirt as it fit as if it were a Large Tall
this shirt was cute for ONE wear.  the fabric is cheap and it pilled after one day of wear...would return if I hadn't missed the return window
"initially when i tried them on the knee area (i do have larger calf size) was just right. After a couple washings that area seems to have gotten tighter. I probably won't be wearing them again, kinda feel like i wasted my money"
"In my opinion, this hat is just downright ugly.  I was hoping that the floral (?) scarf could be removed, but it was not.  This went back."
It won't even twist on came too my door twisted off and broke!
"no support, wears like a too large sock!"
Sexy dress but the strings are super long and you have to take the whole dress off to use the restroom
Zipper broke the first week and the stitching that held the clip come undone.  Would not recommend.
"Definitely not what I expected. It was very thin-I wouldn't even call it a sweater-it looked more like a lace tablecloth sewed together. No shape, no structure and ultimately just looked cheap. Definitely going back."
"I love the look of the sock, however they are thin and I already have a hole in one pair after only wearing them twice."
"The right shoe fit good, the left was lose.  It felt like the strap on the left shoe was bigger than on the right shoe.  They seemed a bit too narrow causing the to feel less secure on my foot."
Good looking outfit but it didn't fit
"Okay, it's nice and heavy so it seems that it will hold many things without falling over BUT the hand is not spread open like it is in the picture.  The pointer and middle fingers are touching so you can't hang very many necklaces on those two fingers.  Weird. I'd probably send it back but I don't have the time and the packing styrofoam fell apart while I was unpacking it.  Anyway, I'd give it 5 stars if it were like the picture here."
These were a good quality. One fit my leg perfectly & the other was so big that it kept falling down.  I finally had to take them off & go with out.  I am 5-6 tall & 156lbs.
Whoever heard of a wallet that won't hold money? It's got slots for cards but no place to put actual cash. WTF? Too much trouble to return it so I guess I will just eat the $20. Do not buy this if you want to carry cash.
Broke within days of purchase. Don't waste your money.
"I wear a size 8, and after a hot wash and dry, I'm STILL swimming in these.  If you wear a 9 or 10, they should fit well."
"I was lured into buying these with the promise of additional heel support and it just wasn't there. I have replaced them with a more shoe-like slipper, the Easy Spirit Explore 24 Mule which I love. Will never go back to these expensive, yet poorly supportive, slippers."
Very slippery in snow. Not very comfortable
Not a very well made sweater. Not something I would ever buy again. Low quality material and didn't fit right
"Im a small girl. So for this to be small on me, it means that the size is messed up and wrong. The sleeves don't even fit! I have to roll'em up in order to wear it. Quality is ok."
"Beautiful shoe, but the strap that goes around the back of the heel is far too short to make it around my foot (and yes, this is the size I always wear in Clarks shoes.) My plan is to return them. Due to the shortness of the strap, I would have to order a half-size up!"
"I bought these based on reviews, hoping they would be a stylish, comfortable alternative to sneakers.  Though they are stylish, I found them lacking in the comfort department.  The Mesa is very stiff and doesn't bend with your foot.  The back of the shoe is cut awfully high and rubbed against my heel and ankle, a sure bet to cause blisters. Also, I wear a size 8, but found them a little short."
"I bought this pair of shoes in April of 2014 and had holes in the light material near the toes by August.  I wear them for both hiking and casually, but was disappointed how quickly the material wore out.  The sole has held up fine, but the lighter material is very thin and rubbed enough to where I have 2 holes in each of my shoes near the toes.  I would expect a shoe to hold up a lot longer than this."
"Brush feels dense but they are very flimsy. For the price, I would expect better overall quality. While it applied the product fine, the bristles are flimsy but dense. Flimsy is really not a great thing when it's 20 bucks. And application was no different than a 6 dollar brush. Japonseque has some other fine products in their line, but this is not one of them."
"Loved the idea of these and the color of the lenses... I had read some reviews about them breaking easily but decided to try them anyway due to low cost, knowing Id be ultra gentle with them. They looked great for a week and then bam... they broke in the middle. Dang."
Came battered and used. I have returned it.
"The opening is so narrow! I know my son is a big fella, but boots should be loose anyway in order to tuck pants in. I seriously don't understand it, just looking down the boot, it's so small. If your child is chubby in any way (mine is only a year old and still chubby!) then heed my warning. I couldn't get my son's leg in. They are so cute though... Perhaps ordering a larger size would result in a larger calf but I doubt it and then he would trip over the too-long foot. So bummed :("
"The quality of these jeans seems excellent, but if you carry all your weight in your bottom, these will not fit without a huge gap  in the back."
Not a good slide. My sons foot just pushed out of the top. No matter how tight we make the Velcro. Don't waste your money.
They shrink significantly after washing which is why the comment above.  And really no leg to speak of...disappointed;(
But cute
"The suit was too short in the body length, the straps are not adjustable and cut into my shoulder. The bra cups are for about a B-C cup which did not fit my DDs. The quality of the suit was fine.  I sent it back and bought a 2 piece tankini instead."
"Beautiful chain, unfortunately did not fit."
"It was not the shoe I ordered. Had to return it. Orderd another pair and it was the wrong size.
VERY ANNOYED."
"I'm not Satisfied with it, they don't look like what is showed on the web psge,i honestly the were more like boy shorts,instead i got big panties ."
This is TINY!  Didn't fit on my 3 mo babies head.
broke it was so thin my fault
Waaaaaaayyy too narrow. Do people seriously have feet this narrow?
"It makes him sweat a lot, is like a plastic bag"
I am a size 16 women's pant and I could not get these leggings past my thighs! They are much smaller than expected.
"Ordered 2 sizes larger than usual, just in case, and I need 2 more sizes larger!  Company would do well to get the sizes figured out.
Had I not been out of town last month, I would return this!!  Very disappointed!"
Definitely not a professional length. It's super tight and short.
runs very small. weird armpit seams.
"I don't need glasses for vision but I do need them for work, so I thought this was great because they were cheap. They look strange, fit poorly and the sides stick out. Showed three of my girlfriends today and they all laughed at how weird they looked on me and then tried them out and they looked bad on everyone. Would not recommend."
"Love them.  The wrap around glasses I wanted them for, are still too large.  I use them for my regular sun glasses."
"Absolutely no shape to it whatsoever!  The sleeves don't even have shape near the wrist.  It's just boxy looking.  I ordered a medium and although the tag on the dress said ""medium,"" I could have easily put 2 of me in this dress...It's enormous.  Returning it."
"I usually don't like Gerber cloths dues to their awkward fit. However i really loved that design so thought about buying this in bigger size, i know Gerber is usually not good with sizing.
Big Mistake!! 12 month size was still tight for my 7 month Baby!!
I like carter's better. Really soft and their sizes last even when babies pass the age requirements."
"Overall, the product does what is advertised, however the eyelets that connect the corset in the front show in slimmer fitting clothing. Looks bumpy and sloppy."
"I personally did not like the material.  Had my fingers crossed...  Was hoping for something a little softer to go with cute outfits, like an old micro-suede one I lost."
"I have had many other automatic watches.  Even after wearing for a couple of days, it would not keep running for more than eight hours after being taken off.  I have an automatic watch winder.  Even after being on it for an extended length of time, it would not stay wound.  Then it began to be inaccurate with the time until it ran so bad I sent it back."
"It would have been a good product if one of the plastic insert legs had not chipped off on first use making it unsteady. I wanted to use it to display my earrings for sell in a consignment store. My husband rigged up a substitute for the broken piece, but the display is wobbly and I am afraid it will not hold up in the store. It does hold all my earrings, but I will have to keep it at home instead of using it for the purpose intended."
I don't agree with the price at all.  I've spent this much on a few pairs of shoes and they are better quality.  I did not wear them to give full review because of the quality.
Really bad material. Not worth your money unless you want Halloween costume material.
It looks to fake. hard to handle and very big.
This product was too large and I returned them.  If they would have been the correct size I would have keep them.
Does not hold as much as I though it would
I was offered through email a special discount on these leggings since I had ordered from this company before. These leggings will not stay up. They keep riding down. They were not worth the small price I paid for them. I am throwing them away or maybe I can cut them up and use for dust cloths.
Not supportive at all.  I was surprised at how much movement (bouncing) there was.  I ended up throwing it away after a few uses.
Returned this item because it was so awful. I ordered a large and could not even get the jacket on. The tag said large but there's no way this was anything a stitch larger than a small. Even if it was a medium I would have been able to fit. I just wanted it to be baggy and larger. Super disappointed.
"These slippers had 2 problems, one had a cut in the toe about and inch long and all the way through, the other had a piece of hard plastic embedded in it that pointed inside so it poked your foot.  Quality control was sleepin."
"Though listed as ""leather"" in the product name, these were made from very cheap, hard rubber and these shoes were of inferior quality.

NOT a wise purchase and they were returned."
"Not very well made, but ok for 1 night."
"I can't stand wearing this bracelet! I mean, I like it, it's pretty, it looks nice, but it pulls and snags my little arm hairs n I'm not even that hairy at all! It's so unfortunate bcs I really like it but it's such a pain to wear :(
I would say if you like stony bracelets and don't mind paying arnd $10 AND you're mostly hairless, go for it, but otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it."
These were flimsy and not very comfortable. Would not recommend. Material is not soft.
"Very beautiful but sizes run very small. 8 1/2 fits like a 7 1/2. Order a size up. I'm extremely disappointed because I ordered it for a concert n sadly, I'll have to return them."
Cheap material. Not denim. Feels like stretchy itchy spandex. Bell bottom is too exaggerated. Did like how high rise they were. Returned. Not worth the price.
I love Panache bras but this did not fit like a Panache bra. Runs small. Returned.
Broke after wearing only a few minutes.
"Definitely not a running shoe.  I ordered thinking I would wear them when running errands; however, fit was snug (and I ordered 1/2 size up).  I returned and after two weeks have still not received a credit for the return (I tracked the return and they were delivered back to the company).  Probably won't be giving Brooks another try."
"So, this was a child's size lace pants and a waste of money. I know, I had my seven year old niece try them on. I decided to hand wash them because they didn't smell right and I hung them up to dry only to find that they shrunk even more and frayed with little pieces of rubber or whatever the use to make them stretchy. Now they are in my trash can waiting to go off. Don't waste your money, they are too small for adults!"
it definitely has the push up technique down. But it fits small. I'm a 32DD and i weigh 100 pounds. I figure I was a large and it fit like a small. the pattern doesn't really match up with the picture either.
This bra did not fit as expected. I did end up returning it.
"I normally love Bloch dance shoes but I find these ones squish the tops of my toes on the nails causing very sore feet, length and width is good but depth is very narrow."
They are cute but they run a bit small gave them away.
"After reading the other reviews, I thought I'd give the kit a shot since it would have cost me approx $10.00 to have my wife's new watch bracelet adjusted.

The only word that comes to mind is ""flimsy"". But what would anyone expect for seven dollars and change? I used 3 of the tools, kept a couple more since they might come in handy at some point and tossed the rest. As far as I'm concerned, I saved a couple of bucks doing the adjustment myself and got a couple of possible tools that might come in handy in the future."
Cheap material. No structure to the bag. If there's anything in it it bows like a hobo bag. Not worth the money.
"These were comfortable and the heavy fabric was nice to have.

They didn't last as long as I hoped though. They all developed huge holes in the bottom. I know boxers aren't supposed to last forever, but my other (same brand) boxers have held up much better."
"Broke when I touched it. Seriously, I picked it up out of the box and the post fell off.  Lol..you get what you pay for."
Sent them back XL doesn't fit thick curvy legs
"They are way too wide in the calves, and the 2nd zipper looks really awful. They are also much too high, as they come up to my knees (I am 5'4). I'm not a fan of the knee high boots, so I rolled the tops down 2 inches into the boot, and sewed them in place with a leather needle & thread. Now the height is several inches below my knee and looks classier. I would have returned them, but Aerosoles is one of the few brands that fit me well for boots, as they heel height is perfect and the foot bed accommodates my wide feet. They are comfy but have plastic noisy heels, so I will have to take to the shoe repair guy for rubber heels. There goes another $15! I am 7.5 or 8; went with 8 and they fit well with a thin insert and crew socks. These are the only disappointing Aerosoles boots I've ever ordered!"
Not at all Brown. It's close to orange. But looked strong.
To tiny.  Ball comes off easily.  Needs more threading to be secure
"I sent this shirt back.  The shirt was sewn crooked.  Also, the belt like fabric in the center seems like it would twist and not lay flat.  Pretty color, though."
"Cute bag, and the leather bottom makes it nice and sturdy. Hopefully it'll stand up to whatever middle school can throw it's way!

It's not ONE MONTH into school and I've had to re-sew both straps on both ends!  The sides are wearing thin already.  My daughter doesn't overload her bag, but it's not holding up to middle school needs.  It's a cute bag for sleep overs or light use, but not daily school use."
Very tight fit. Returning them at the time of this review.
They are longer than I need them and not adjustable so they don't really help me.
"Size down, ladies. This boot is HUGE. I am normally, so that is what I ordered, and I probably could've gotten away with a 10. Beyond that, the shaft is INCREDIBLY wide and there is no real way of tightening it to size so it kind of looks like a little kid wearing a fireman's boots or something like that. They look cute in the picture, but in real life they are gigantic and silly. Good in theory, poor execution."
"I really wanted to love this top. The material seemed nice and flowy, not to heavy not too thin, the color was lovely- HOWEVER, I decided to wash the top before I wore it, as I would any top. Put it in on gentle/handwash cycle, with like colors and hung to dry. After drying, it was covered with what looked like oily spots. None of the other items I washed had these spots. I thought perhaps my detergent/softener didn't rinse out properly, so I spot treated the areas and manually hand washed it again, with a mild detergent and no softener, and hung to dry. Once dry, it had the spots again! New ones, and in different areas. I gave it once last try, washing on gentle with Woolite, alone. More spots. Needless to say, it was a wasted purchase and I won't be wearing and cannot return it, because it's been washed 3 times. I gave it two stars because it WAS pretty, right out of the package and WOULD HAVE fit beautifully. I won't order another."
"horrible. i didn't like it at all  it falls when i walk, and its very  uncomfortable not what I expected"
returned as could fit two people in them
"Ordered a xxl because that's what medium is. The butt cheek part is too big, but the sleeves of the legs are too tight. Note, I have slender legs."
The body fit great but sleeves too short on Large. I'm a standard L t shirt with 34in sleeve
"They are very comfortable, thin and soft, however, they are beginning to tear at the seam of the wast in less than one month."
"Perfect fit.....  If I was still in the fifth grade.  I stand 5'10"" tall and weigh around 200 lbs.  Too small,  too tight."
"After wearing once, it stretched out so wide that it won't stay up anymore. The colors are cute but only get it if you want it bunched up at the bottom of your leg."
"Looks better than picture, really nice prop. Only issue I had was the bullets keep slipping out, one in particular causing the entire belt to come apart. It wasn't a pretty sight chasing bullets and casings while at the Halloween party. I had to take it off before the end of the night so I could enjoy myself."
When I washed this in cold water it bled all over everything. It ruined my whole load of laundry.
-_-
"Zipper broke today, the first time I tried to use the wallet.  While on holiday in Japan.  Worse than useless, this thing is now going to cause me problems on the rest of my trip.  Avoid."
Not worth it. No quality! Cheaply made
"When I saw 10-13, I was, like, FINALLY!  I found the old size before manufacturers cheaped out and went from 9-12 to 6-12.  The socks are too tight for me and the same sized socks are too small for me elsewhere.  I was VERY disappointed and angry when the product arrived and it was 6-12 shoe size!  Where was that in the listing on Amazon.com?  I typed in 10-13 and received 6-12???"
Not true to size and poor quality. Have several shapers and expected the same quality as those! Don't waste your time!!!
didnt like the fit at all -- the sixing is way off and by no means did they fit her-- I had to retun them -- way too small -- like about 4 sizes too small and that is off .
I received the anklet but not the bracelet
They are cute too look at but were too small and very difficult to get on without any kind of zipper. Returning for a different style.
Pants came ripped at the seam down the leg below the knee area.
"Probably send back. Have weird piece on top, definitely run small"
"Very disappointed, very low quality! Not recommend to anyone."
"Ran much smaller than expected. Like 2 sizes. Luckily, I have a younger daughter that could wear it."
"The elastic at the bottom was big and lose, had to fold them,or they drag. Not at all what I expected."
I loved these rings but unfortunately after one use the gold on one of them came off.
"Okay, I ordered this to wear under clingy clothes so I would have a smooth line.  I wanted the bra attached so I didn't have to worry about finding a strapless bra.  I read the sizing chart and ordered correctly but when it arrived, I tried to try it on and couldn't even get it over my head or over my thighs (tried to step into it).  I needed it to wear on a cruise and didn't have time to re-order...I know, I shouldn't have waited to the last minute to order, but I thought I would find one locally and when I didn't I decided to try Amazon.  I will be returning this...I must say, I haven't had a lot of luck with sizing ordering clothes on Amazon, now I will have to see how the return process works.  This will be one of several items I need to return...I'll let you know how easy it is or is not!"
"It looked like a great idea.  Being large breasted makes it difficult to find a good fit.
The design of this bra makes it difficult to put on and take off.
The cup size would have been fine except for the excessive amount of material between the cups.
That made the bra overly bulky and unwearable.
I wish someone could make a bra ( of any kind, sports or every day wear ) that was sized right for large breasted women without assuming that the cup size meant ""large"" all over.
I measure of a 36 G(G).
Unfortunately, I'll have to return this and start my search all over again.
Services with Amazon are excellent.  My review reflects the product only."
"I wear a 10. Every shoe I own is a 10, except maybe one or two pair that are 9.5. So why did this size 10 hurt my feet? Because they were too small and tight. My toes were numb after 10 minutes! Returned for a full refund........."
This watch will fade after two wears...not worth it
"I have a black pair of Lysse leggings, which I love.  I'd hoped these would fill a similar role in my summer wardrobe.  They were a thick fabric, which was good, but just really tight and unattractive compared to the black leggings in the same size."
"I don't know what happened to these.  I have 7 other pairs of these pants all in the same size and the new ons I just got I had to return because they didn't fit (not even close) with the ones I had previously they are comfortable and fit well but they continue to fade and shrink with every wash, even 6 months later they keep going.  So I bought more which fit well again as the others continued to shrink little by little. Then the new ones would do the same but since I have trouble finding comfortable black pants in my size to ware for work I would keep on reordering these until this last time when they wouldn't fit at all.  I have not changed sizes. I am the same weight and measurements as I was with the first 7 pairs I have had."
"Item was way too small and not even the right shirt I ordered.
Extremely disappointed."
"I wore this beautiful set for about a week. One of the stones on the side of the larger ring dropped out without any warning and is lost, so here's a second set of Lany rings that are of no use to me.  Nice price, pretty products but the quality just is not there."
I ordered a wide in this shoe and it wasn't wide enough. Also the cut and stiffness of the material caused it to dig into the top of my toes nearest my instep. My feet hurt for days after wearing them.
fell apart the 1st time they were worn
O thought I found the perfect gift for my sister thank god I opened it first it is so small would never fit my sister maybe a five yr old but thats it the word sister was smooshed so close together u cant even read it I was so disappointed and am returning it
I'm a size six an this belt is waaay too big for me.  Since it's elastic one size should fit all but I would say this is plus sized.
too small around the toes.
Was expecting this to look much more better in hand but sadly was very much disappointed. It fits good and all though.
"If I was looking for a dress to go to a nightclub in and look slutty while being 7 months pregnant this would be it. But I'm not, I was looking for a dress for my baby shower and this left very little up to the imagination. Not flattering I returned it."
Don't order if you have boobs! Super cute style but if you're bigger than a B cup you will be spilling out everywhere. It's also not very stretchy. :(
"I never bought hoop piercings before, so I didn't buy the correct size. I wanted something smaller and fitted closer to my nose. I don't like it at all but that is NOT the sellers fault."
"didn't expect high quality for this price, but the necklace was disappointing even with mediocre expectations. It is NOT as nice as the photos.  I expected the black pearls would be dyed, but they were done very poorly."
A very very tight fit! Order a size or 2 larger.
Run small and they are even smaller after washing. This one size does not fit all. They are too short too!
Much cheaper looking then expected.  Plastic very thin.
"Not sure which measuring tape they use. Maybe, these are measured in Kilometers instead of inches. Ordered a large pair of pants... and, yes, they were large -perhaps even large enough for Shamu."
"I'm rating this 2 stars because Clarks should be comfortable but they weren't comfortable for me. The shoes are super adorable online but when I put them on with my dress pants, the style no longer seemed appealing to me. I do have wide toes and narrow heals which is why I thought this shoe would fit but just the opposite. I will never buy shoes online again... best to try them on  in the store. This purchase was a few months ago and I think I recall I had to pay shipping to ship it back."
Too small and ugly felt. They just don't fit. Returned. The loop is too big to keep them in place as well. Just not good.
"I am returning these simply because they were tried on prior to receiving them and the right heal had already been broken down from someone smashing it down.  I tried to lift with the tab, used shoe horn, but the heal folded in and rubbed ankle.  Also were soiled inside the heal.
The shoes are really cute, great colors, fit my difficult foot, wide enough.  I did not wear long enough to know if arch support which is moderate would have been good enough all day.  I did notice thought fatigue immediately under forefoot."
"returned, was thick as a brick and awkward to open"
You can get these at the dollar store save your money
"Terrible fit, way too small no give to the sleeves."
I did not like them at all.  I had to return them.
Started falling apart after first use!  Buyer beware!  This is leather??????
"These boots didn't even last 2 months. Both boots have holes next to the seem located at the zipper. What's worse, is no one has boots now and it's snowing. I will NEVER buy this brand again. Might as well go to Walmart and purchase 2 pairs of boots for the same price. :( Crap quality."
"Dress is nice, but the sizing is crazy. I purchased a XXL it would not zip up I am a size 10, really????"
As a person with five legs I am ofended that they do not come in my size
"Bought two pairs of these in different colors.  Neither pair fit.  That'd be ok, maybe I've just stretched what I'm wearing now, but, why were both pairs of pants the same size on the label but different sizes from themselves?  One was a little tight and the others I couldn't even get in!  I did get them on sale so maybe that's what it was."
"I have other 34C from this brand that still fit me but this one had both a larger cup size and a larger band circumference (only slightly, but enough to make it not fit properly). The material is nice and comfortable, and I'll try to exchange for a different size."
Pretty outfit but the plus sizes aren't what they read to be.  For example a 2x fits more like a large
Great blue color but had to return. They are very narrow which is why i said somewhat small but then they are long.  If your child has narrow long feet these may work but my son regular to wide feet.  These are almost misshapen?
"Exactly it's price in worth :/
Broke easy"
"Bought these for my son, when it arrived we all laughed when he put it on and returned it that same day."
"At first glance, these socks seem to be comfortable for everyday casual wear with tennis shoes and loafers.  They seem to wear out quicker than I expected, though.  The no-show is a bit deceptive, though.  You can see the tops of them under almost any shoe.  Finally, they slip down off my heel when I walk.  I definitely won'g be buying these again."
"I ordered a 5XLT as I have tactile issues and prefer very loose clothing. The tshirt I received is as big as a 2XL at most, it is about 6"" longer than a typical tall shirt, the neck is about 1"" smaller than my neck, and the fabric feels like my waterproof canvas boat cover."
They were quite larger than I expected...
This hat is massive. Will not fit you unless you have a head the size of a watermelon.
"Nice leather and plenty of width for your toes, but very narrow everywhere else."
I ordered ONE of these as a stocking stuffer and the seller took it upon himself to charge me for THREE..I certainly have no use for THREE of these cheapie little pieces of plastic! They're like something out of the Dollar Store!
"I  spent $150 for these.  I bought them for my registration work in the hospital, which means I haven't gotten to use them for running.  I haven't had these shoes for 6 months & they have already separated from the sole.  The seller has a return policy for far less than that, so I can't even exchange them.  I attached a photo, so you can see the separation is at the most needed part of the sole: the ball of the foot. I will not be using or referring this seller again due to the poor quality of their product."
"I liked the look of these boots but when I went to try them on... surprise!... there is no way to open the top of the boot. There is just no room to slide a foot into the small circle that is the opening. I have very tiny feet (size 5) and there was no way I could get even half of my foot in. And the laces are just decorative. They serve no function. Was very, very annoyed that these were so impossible to even try on. I am returning them."
"Looks terrible.  Cheap, and extremely thin material.  It is not Polo by Ralph Lauren.  It's attempting to be similar though."
"Very scratchy fabric not soft has I expected and where the elastic around the waist very itchy, was very disappointed"
They might fit a 4 year old.  Definitely not for a older teens foot.
Ran as soon as I put them on.
"Very thin, cheap"
Disappointed....
"Even though the hospital we went to was a more relaxed and non-traditional type... it is one of the oldest birthing centers in the country (with a relaxing apartment-like room, private shower, lounge chairs and bed with dedicated adjacent traditional hospital birthing room if there are any problems)... they would not allow us to use this garment. It was made too constrictive and without easy access (would need to be cut open). The hospital wouldn't even let her put it on as they said they would need to cut it off and it was a liability. WASTE OF MONEY!"
"first time i ordered Xl because my size is Xl
but was very very smal for me.i gave to my sister ( my sister's size is Small)
next time i ordered XXXL .
so if you are xl you should order3XL"
Probably the worst pair of shoes I ever purchased. Ordered up one size which provided adequate length but the left shoe was narrow and pinched to the point I was limping. I tried cutting the side of the insert down without any improvement. At least I didn't have to pay full price for them.
"I purchased these for the wide calf portion, not realizing that the foot would also be extremely wide. They did not work for me at all I gave them away."
"There is little to no stretch to this bra. The arm holes are small, very high cut...which would be great for bulge but they are too tight and are borderline painful. I garnet that if I wore this for more than the time it takes to try on, I'd be in pain with irritation and maybe chaffing. The band around the ribs is also small and doesn't stretch. There is no accommodation to this bra and it's beyond uncomfortable and closer to painful. Very disappointed, money is tight but I needed something that would help me nurse. Sad to have wasted the money on something I can't even wear. Ordered a size according to other reviews and size charts :(."
Looked nice online but not at all when got it and realized that the quality of this product is very poor quality. Didn't keep it.
I ordered a 34DD. I didn't like how it made my boobs look. Not only did it not push my boobs together like in the picture (separated then) it also squished my outer boob section inwards if that makes sense. It looked a lot sexier in the pictures.  It however is comfortable so if that's all you are looking for then this is your bra. I will be returning.
"I am disappointed because I had thought these earings were sterling silver.  They are very pretty and my daughter loves them, however THEY TURN HER EARS GREEN "
These shoes looked better in the picture than on my feet.  The color is flat and cheap looking.  I am returning them.
"The sole is very stiff, not soft at all as it is described. The thong design is awfuland blister my toe."
"Returned shoes, did not have an adequate substitute, too small also."
"Unfortunately, this product sheds and is quite messy."
They are way to small and are made for narrow feet.
The rubber chicken broke/pulled off in only a few days. I hope the company that made this doesn't manufacture prophylactics.
Washed it and it's not flat anymore. Totally warped brim.
"Came shipped with two dents in the frame, shipping box was fine. I returned it without replacement because I felt that this portended future issues, given the roughness of airline luggage handlers. Product was truly ""lightweight"" and felt fragile.  Desired for international travel.  Opted for a travelpro bag and have been very satisfied."
"when i purchased the item, i was happy with the soled feet, hopeing that it would help in motivating baby to crawl. As soon as we put the sleeper on for the first time the zipper broke, We even purchased a 12 month sleeper since she is talk for her age. Very disappointed in this product."
"I chose this rating as I totally dislike this product. For starters it is supposed to be genuine lambskin, but the tags inside this wallet indicate that it is genuine faux laeather right next to the Made in India tag. The stitching is very poor and the zippers are very cheap plastic. Two of the zippered compartments on the inside would not even open. To me, it was simply a poorly made wallet and a fake to a name brand wallet."
"I am a size 6. I ordered a small/medium in this belt, and it does not fit at all. It's way too small. In addition, the quality of this belt is extremely poor. I would advice against making this purchase."
Much  too large
"Too small!!!! Love my old proper hats, but they've clearly started making them smaller, even the fabric cuts are different, too bad, they use to make quality hats!!"
"not filled my expectations , very large"
"Shoes lasted a few months and ""leather"" tore up on bothe shoes inside and outside by toe protector. Won't buy again."
I ordered them on Dec. 3 for a Christmas gift for my daughter and they came in Dec 31. Late and too small. They look cute but too small. I am sending them back.
"It fit well and was flattering to my size, except the ruching on the tummy seemed more like a defect than an intentional style detail. I actually looked back at my order to see if I'd accidentally ordered a maternity suit, but I hadn't. Also, the mint green color is much more the color of Gumby than the color shown. I didn't hate the suit, but I didn't love it either. Ultimately I ended up returning it because I know there are more flattering suits out there for me."
"Way too low of a neck line. the picture makes it look like you can wear it normally, well you can't the material is too this to wear this without a bra."
The only problem I have with this shoe is it runs TOO SMALL! I shouldve listened to everyone else and ordered up. My big toe is practically at the tip of the shoe. Im hoping it stretches out as well but doubt it. I want to return it for a bigger size but don't want to go through hassel but I may
"Not a great purchase I must say, Shoe is correct size, but it doesn't stay on the back...very annoying."
"Edited: 12/6/16 The thin, plastic clasp broke, so the front pocket hangs open.  No idea if I can exchange it.  Very disappointing.
I ordered this for my 12 year old son to put all his school supplies in as his pencil case wasn't cutting it at all.  He has so much room and utilizes every area, with room to spare.  He even puts his somewhat large library book in the open area that is held in by the clasp.  It can be easily worn over his shoulder or across his body.  The back pocket is big enough for keys, or for his purpose, scotch tape.  We went with the large size.  I've always wanted an army green bag, so I'm a little jealous.  Ha!  It's nicely constructed and we are both very pleased with this bag.  There is so much more room left that if he happens to get a cell phone soon, I will rest easier knowing he has somewhere to put it."
just eh...
"I bought this watch because it was a decent looking, minimalist watch at a very low price. It turned out to be too good to be true as expected. Less the 24 hours after receiving it the time changed on its own rendering it useless as a watch. Thankfully I was refunded by Amazon."
I am so disappointed. The picture shows silver buckles and zippers and the bag that I received has gold and is flimsy as all get out. I was looking for a sturdy black and silver bag and this is NOT it. I am very disappointed. I will try to return but it may not be worth it.
"this gown is not at all as pictured.

see-through but soft, so I give 3 stars."
Obnoxiously huge. We returned it.
I need a large purse with lots of compartments and this one did not fit the bill. It is very narrow and does not hold nearly all the stuff that I need a purse to hold.
"Useless  -defective watch with non-working knob. The handles are just swaying aimlessly...Thought I'd take a chance since some reviewers reported getting good products.
Thank you Amazon for non-hassle return policy."
"Not as described. Looks nothing like the picture except that it has spots. It is not thick enough to be a rain coat it is made of one very thin layer of windbreaker material and the color is a super bright pink, not red. I'm very disappointed and would not purchase again."
I have been airing this bag out in my garage for 13 days. Why is it in the garage? Because it stunk my whole house up! It smells of some chemical. I didn't even think that it was leather so I contacted the seller. I was told to let it air out and take it somewhere to verify that it was leather. I took it to a quality leather goods store in the area and they advised that it was in fact leather but they were confused as to what caused the leather to smell like a chemical. I decided to keep the bag because it is leather and the bag doesn't smell as bad as it did when it arrived. I still wouldn't use it on vacation and it can't come in the house yet.
I gave it away  cant return it to china
This was thee single worst belt ever. I bought it for my dad for Christmas and not even a full week and the belt is worn out. Do not buy! It's cheap material.
"This umbrella is a great size - bigger than most umbrellas I've seen. The open/close mechanism works well. However, in the half-day I've used it, it's flipped inside out at least 5, if not 10, times. If you live in a wind-less area, this umbrella would be great. With any significant wind, would not recommend."
"I can't understand how this tank top could possibly be sold as a size XL. I should have read the reviews before purchase. This thing barely looks like it would fit an elementary school student.

Just to confirm how ridiculous this is, I measured it. As you can see in the photo, it measures 12 inches across the bust. 12 inches????? Even if it had 6 inches of stretch (which it doesn't) it would still only fit a 36"" bust which is a size small. I would guesstimate tank top as a size small at absolute best. More like an XS.

It feels really cheap too... Just don't order this."
"Doesn't fit like a dress, more like a long shirt. The color is not as represented; it's a much brighter green, not to my liking. Pretty disappointing all around, there are better t-shirt dresses to be had."
Great shirt. I ordered 2 sizes bigger but it was still fitting
After a month and a half the inside of shoe is coming apart
Buy a seiko 5. This is not a good choice. Unnecessary silly divers toy. Not a quality piece.
"Based on the reviews and the sizing, I ordered one of these bra's thinking it would hold up well. I am a 36DDD/38DD and this bra didn't hold at all, not even with the straps. The cups didn't fit at all, and the wire was stabbing me in cleavage. I never wore it and it definitely was a waste of money because I wasn't able to return it. Don't waste your time."
"Its not orange, it's an ugly goldenrod color"
very pretty but way too small and my baby girl is not big.
Terrible material. Looks nothing like picture. Completely see through! You could even see my underwear lines. I have to send it back because it's awful. Straight garbage!
Most of the time large is just right or a little loose this was tight and it tore
I bought this due to the positive reviews it received here but when I received it I was so disappointed. The bottoms fit perfectly while the top was way too large. I would recommend you to steer clear of purchasing this.
"OMG, I just received this watch, been working on it for half an hour! Yes, I have the manual. I admit I'm not tech savvy but come on Casio this is ridiculous. It took me 10 mins to set time, not to horrible. I've been trying for 20 mins to set the day of the week! I'll wait until my daughter's in town and see if she can figure it out. I also have set an alarm somehow & can't figure out how to cancel it. It's an adorable watch, thought it'd be great for skiing, and water sports but just way to difficult to set up. I think the sellers ought to set up the time & day/date anyway but I guess that's what I get for buying a watch online. I'm sure it's a great watch for those that have a degree in computer science."
Hole in toe area with first wearing.
"The pattern is really cute and pretty, but the design of the suit is weird. It definitely makes you look slimmer, but the top part felt like I was going to fall out of it. I'm not a busty girl either, but the straps on it didn't do anything to actually pull the shelf on it up. If I bought the size up it probably would be baggy in my stomach/backside area (I'm 5'10'' and slender) I do have a long torso, but the way the top shelf hit me would barely cover my chest. I'd imagine if you're shorter and more flat chested this might work, but if you're completely opposite proportions I would stay away from this swimsuit."
"The line down th pants popped before even putting them on. I liked the pants so much though I popped out a few more threads in the straight line. If that makes sense. Attracts hair,pilled the first day. Why do I like them so much? Price and they look and feel good on."
"It's a gorgeous dress. Love the melon color. The sizing says up to an XL (which I am) and they are right. However, the dress made me look HUGE. It was unflattering in all areas, especially in the waist. I wanted to like it, but I knew I would never wear it. So, I sent it back and got a refund."
"I think these shoes run like t sizes too large.  It's like wearing a giant box on your foot.  Imagine if you put your foot into a box of kleenex and walked around.  That's what happened here.  I get it, pink galoshes are to be cute and not functional, but I'm not about to even try to get these down to the correct size that I would be.  I ordered an 8, felt like I got an 11.  Crazy big."
Very flimsy!
Way to small Asian size ordered xl fits like a small.
this product was shipped from Japan I did not know this when I place this order the sweater is way too small for an extra large
I love wallflower jeans very much. But these are not skinny jeans as much as they are relaxed fit. Disappointed.
"I hesitate to review of these shoes as I sent them back the day iI received them. They just didn't fit my feet the way I expect shoes to feel. I have several pairs of Reebok shoes which I still have and and still wear, but these ""just didn't feel right"" This is not a poor review of these shoes in general I just simply did not feel comfortable with them on my feet so I  isent them back and bought another pair at double the price. Im glad I did as the new shoes  (ASICS) fit my feet much better"
"The fabric of the boot was not glossy as depicted in the photograph.  Parts were dull (as if someone had tried to clean them) and other parts were glossy.  Had to send them back. Also, too wide at the very top for no particular reason.  Felt rain or water would get in."
The belt is the correct length and it was shipped promptly.  The smell coming from the belt was so strong that I had to put the belt outside the house.  After two days it still smelled so badly that I threw it away
"I didn't like it, im tall and slim complex, im about 5'9' and they didn't fit me, it is very very small, I think they fit only very super small people. Also if they start stretching, they look like white, because they fabric is like painted."
"The boots themselves are absolutely lovely and have exactly the look I was going for. However, I have smaller calves and was wholeheartedly disappointed that even with the straps I have been unable to get them to fit correctly. It is clear that these were designed for larger women so please be advised if you are a smaller person, that these might not be the right boots for you or may require alteration."
rough and scratchy material
"Looks awesome in the photo. When I tried, I felt like I wore a gunny sack. It was out of shape and did not drape well. The print and material is however good."
Order 2 sizes up.
JUNK! buyer beware this is as cheap as it comes and is way over priced if you want a nice bag stick with under armor or nike
I sent this back. Too big and too long. Looked like my grandmothers robe from 1970.
I had such high hopes. I put like every color in my cart to save for later. But ordered 1 to start. It's a tank. Nothing special. Not long. I ordered a 3x. And it just was not long at all. Very bummed.
The fabric isn't breathable and it lasted about a dozen wears before it started falling apart. So while affordable not worth it.
Too tight in the toe box.  They were returned
No good do not buy.
These are really heavy and clunky...wouldn't recommend
Not the best but whatever
Cut was small.
They came damaged and look as if they were already wore! Extremely disappointed!
"This is my second watch in the past five months. The pins pulled out of both of them. Also, the date stopped working. Great style, but the quality is surely lacking."
Not as sparkle as I thought it would be the stones were dull
Making them basically useless. Poor design.
Turns your finger blue!!!!!!!
The design by the toes digs into the top of your feet - the rings should start further up on the sandal
"These pants were great, until I washed them.  They started getting holes after the first wash in a washing machine, and fell apart within the first month.  I would give these pants zero stars if I could.  Buyer beware, these pants are awful!"
not what i expected hate to return anything but i probably chose the wrong style will try again when i find something else
"I ordered these shoes in a 10W in both black and blue.  The black fit perfectly and are so comfortable.  The blue 10W were way to tight.  I didn't realize it until it was too late to return the blue, so on a whim I ordered a second blue 10W, it too was way smaller than the black.  I was able to return the second pair but am stuck with the first (my own fault)."
Very good quality but the size chart is not correct it show smaller then the real. I ordered one but i cannot use it coz. it's too big.
"After 3 months of water aerobics, this suit faded in very strange places and was all stretched out."
"Watch was too small, returned it. Looked too feminine. And i DO NOT like the gigantic watches but this was just too petite. I got another G-shock i like much better. Sadly it doesn't have the features this one did. I tried."
One of the pairs was cut.  Overall weird fit.  They do show while wearing ballet flats.
A piece of junk.
"The boots run very small. I am 8 and I have bought other boots without problems. I need to change them for a few more numbers, or 9 to make them fit.
I bought two pairs of boots, one black pair and one brown pair. They left me small. I started and paid for a refund process, where the repayment of one pair was already started, but the other pair is missing. I'm waiting to buy them again both pairs."
Impossible to close
Actually bought this for a present and my friend likes these!!
I am normally a medium/large when it comes to shape wear.... let's just say it was a real struffle trying to get the large on. I know it's supposed to hide those rolls but the problem is- you can barely get it over those rolls. I do like how it works in conjunction with my bra to help give lift so the top half is awesome. The worst part is that its super tight on my hips and cuts in. When I'm wearing leggings it should how padded my hips and thighs are. Recommendation: Go Up A Size. Also the pink is more of a red so the color wasn't exactly what I was expecting.
waste of money. Two of the zippers broke within 3 weeks.  Don't waste your money.  This was my second one. The first one broke but I thought I'd give it another try because they are roomy and just what I was looking for but my second one broke too. I'm out of the money and the wristlets.
"I bought 2 pairs for a morning religious service and then a party that evening.  Initially, I thought these were perfect and stayed up but after a few hours, one stocking started to fall below my knee.  I opened the second pair to wear in the evening and again, after about 2 hours, they started to fall.  So now, after $18, I have one leg that still has stickiness.  Very disappointed!!"
Not as pretty as the pic but OK.
"Thin, cheap material. Not stretchy. I bought silver, but colour is not exactly same as picture."
"I was excited to get this sweatshirt, but unfortunately I wasn't too impressed with it when it arrived. The company ""Rapid Dominance"" is making these sweatshirts in China. The end result isn't too impressive. The shirt has a cheap feel to it and doesn't look that great. I was looking for something to show my pride of my former branch of service. In the end, a cheaply made product that was produced in a communist country and doesn't look that good on me really doesn't show my pride well."
"Very difficult to adjust. Way too much excess belt (for a size32) to try to tuck under the belt, also difficult. On a positve, once on, the belt is very light and comfortable.belt is also very wide and did not fit thru loops of one pair of pants. I have already returned it"
I like the way these shoes look but they didn't fit in the heel.. .too loose.  I sent back. :-(
"Really thought this bag would hold up better than it has, given the Travelpro name brand and the great reviews here on Amazon. I've had it for just over 2 years, but it started falling apart after just 1 year: Inside mesh ripped; outside of bag severely scuffed when checked; zippers constantly get stuck. Not a ""road warrior"" by any means, and no overstuffing or rough treatment (other than, perhaps, the baggage handlers!). Looking for one of those small, hardshell deals for my next bag."
"I had a c-section almost a  month ago.  I knew this and wanted to order in advance so I could wear this home.  I even  went to the website and completed the questions in order to get an accurate size.  The thing STILL does not fit; I was very swollen from the IV when I left the hospital and I've lost 20 lbs. When I got home,  I couldn't get it up my thighs.  Now I can, but can't close it. I wanted to use this ASAP its just sitting in my drawer.

I'm pretty disappointed, especially because thus was so expensive."
nothing like picture..
"I was disappointed with these earrings. They really have no sparkle to them and even though they have the neat setting, they still have no shine. These were not what I thought, however you might like them."
The shirt came earlier than expected. Also came much crappier than expected. The graphic was terribly printed and took up maybe 6 inches of the shirt rather than the whole thing. The graphic didn't even look the same because the printing was so awful
"We ordered TWO rings from Jinique - a size 5 for her, and a size 12 for him. They arrived on time, but were BOTH too small! Took to a jewelry store and discovered their sizing is off by a half-size.  BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!  Jinique told me they check their ring sizes for accuracy prior to being shipped - clearly this isn't the case. In fact, it's a blatant LIE. You get what you pay for folks, and in this case, you pay for a ripoff. The shipping cost to return these and the hassle involved is hardly worth the price of the actual refund. What a crock!"
"Sorry. I had to return these.  They were too pale as far as color goes.  I wanted them for the 2nd ear piercing, and they hardly showed color at all. They were cheap, but that's what I got...not even close to what I wanted."
Had this case for one month and the glue holding the leather to the hard backing is starting to come undone on the edges where the case is held. It's like it's melting.
The glasses are terrible and crooked.  Very disappointed with the product.
This purse is soooo thin. I will not be able to put anything heavy in it the straps will break off. You get what you pay for...
"Ordered 7.5 because I wear a 7, barely got my feet in. The zipper was nice and the top part fit my wide calf but these shoes were just awkward to walk in since they were so tight on my ankle and foot. Then the heal was higher than I expected."
Not too bad looking but really narrow
"the rubber nubs on the bottom should have one more row on the inside and outside edge of
the slipper. the foot tends to rock because of that. i would not buy this design again."
"I love Anne Klein shoes but I owned this pair for less than 2 weeks before the plastic ""coating"" of the shoe started to peel and rip off of the shoe, making them unsightly."
"It fits ok but the material its not comfortable,  is stiff and itchy around the middle."
Magnet not strong enough
Sizes are completely off compared to in stores
"I don't know who this listed vendor is supposed to be but these are an Oriental Trading Company branded product.  Had I known, I wouldn't have ordered them. They are the standard, cheap OTC product.  I had to re-knot several of the closure strings, sew corners together, and cut off all the sloppy loose threads.  I guess a good point would be that the fabric is cute and bright but they were too high-maintenance just to make them useable as party treat bags."
"I'm 34 waist size but this one is really small, is like a 32 waist size"
"The material is awkward on me and it flares a little at the bottom, which I wasn't expecting. Gave it away as a present instead of keeping it."
"These pants are for a woman with no booty. My wife is a coach for beach body and she has an athletic body with the right curves from the waist down, very much like the woman in the picture for these pants. These pants seem to be made for a woman with a straight front and back. She tried them on normal and backwards and they fit the same: halfway down her rear like they weren't pulled up all the way and the front covered her belly button. Womens pants should have more material in the back, like most every pair of pants/leggings ever made. These don't. I ordered her size but these seemed too small. I'd like to get a bigger size but I don't know if they would fit right based on how the material seems cut the same for front and back."
"Love the shirt, love the material, good fit...poorly made. Very poorly made, the graphic is slanted off to the right and I look ridiculous. Kinda of a bummer but, I guess I'll live with it but I really was hoping this would be a good buy. Shirt is too distorted."
"Broke while wearing for first time  Walking in grocery store, full cart, ankle twisted, much embarrassment.  Threw the bitches in the trash and finished shopping while barefoot.  Too bad, because these sandals are otherwise super cute and comfortable.  Do not buy unless you enjoy public humiliation."
It fits tight in the toes.
"Legs fit perfect, waist was enormous. No way to wear these "
"I bought these for my daughter, a runner and a hiker, but she complained about the back tip of the shoe gnawing her. I'm afraid that she's right, but it's a combination of Columbia and my genetic engineering since my daughter has my cankels. We have Fed Flintstone feet.

The larger problem with this shoe is also a faulty made pair--that my daughter complained about that I dismissed. Only when she returned them to me did I noticed that the left is deeper in the heel than the right. If I wear these, I will create an unhealthy walk that could cause more problems that I do not need.

I hope to talk with Amazon about returning these. It's a shame because they look so lovely on the market page. I have learned my lesson: I will not buy another Columbia trail shoe. My advice: Go Vasque. This morning, I tried this pair on and felt the deep gap in the left shoe, changed to my Vasques, and walked for two hours."
Looks nothing like the picture and is super cheesy and the tip of the cover will not bend like a witch shoe
the 2 stars is because it's a cute swimwear. I love the style but it is way too big. It says size M but it's actualy a large or even an extra large. I had to return it.
It fell apart the very first time I wore it the whole side split out. I would not buy it again.
"I bought these in a size 7, the size i always get in tennis shoes. These were significantly larger than what i normally wear and had to return them."
These fit wrong and I wont.be getting more unless I'm offered them replaced with some that fit.
"I found these shoes to be really cute, but I returned them without even putting them on my child's feet because there were mold spots on the inside of both shoes.  I literally took them out of the package and could tell right away something was wrong.  There were brown mold spots on the interior and although the shoes didn't smell like mold, they didn't have a very pleasant smell.

*I originally received this item at a discount to provide an honest review. My opinions are 100% my own and in no way influenced by the seller."
Did not like this scarf. It's huge. I probably will never wear it.  It's soft though.
Not at all what I expected especially for the price. Very cheap and would probably fall apart the first time used. Returning it.
"The rings I received are a very dark gray metal; not at all what I was anticipating.  The fit was fine and the stones were very nice, I just can't get past the color of the metal.  I am returning."
"I tried to like this bra, but the front zip design just isn't for me. It is hard for me to get it zipped up, so I end up reaching for one of my other sports bras instead of dealing with the hassle. I will say that once this bra is successfully zipped and on, I do like it and think it is comfortable to work out in. However, I would not buy it again or recommend it to anyone with a large bust because of how difficult it is to put on. I have other sports bras that I like just as much as this one that are much easier to put on."
"I am usually a huge fan of Madden Girl shoes as it seems they are one brand that fit my big feet well, until i ordered these. i couldn't even get my foot in. They are super cute boots but i would recommend going up a size. I go the largest size possible so its one of those things that just doesn't work for me."
Not what expected but haven't got time to return. I could wear it if im entertaining at home
I should ordered a 9/10.
"I was so excited to get these boots. Loved the name. The look...
However. As read in reviews I ordered a half size up. The size was defiantly correct, but they were swishing my pinky toe. (Flat feet)
Also because I had to order a half size up, I thought my feet looked enormous in these.
 As also read in reviews- The tongue on the R boot defiantly hung forward. A LOT.
I returned these."
looked good and price was good but one i got watch it was very not cheaply made but it felt like a after market brand. im used to invicta and stuhrling  and for the money you can get better quality . seconds hand was off i was losing about 2 minutes a day ill try another one maybe later on but not my type of watch
for the amount of money you can get way better sports bras for larger breasted girls.  This had the issue of the boobs pushing the bra out in front.
"Poor quality. Very wrinkley. Thin material. I kept it, but have never worn it. Don't bother."
"I like it but
Look what happened to it after two time
It is ashame
Lost"
Fabric was knit and not what I expected. Nice quality.
"I bought these because they came in a 29 inch inseam and the claimed to have a waist band that sits at your true waist. The length is fine and they indeed do rest at my waist. The problem is the the rise is wrong (the length of fabric from waist to crotch). I feel like I'm advertise the fact that I am a male, there is not enough room and I'm pulling at the rear to get the seam out of my crack. My other complaint is, they came out of the bag with an unpleasant smell, stiff and scratchy. After 2 washings they still show the packing creases and have softened a bit. Fix the rise and abandon whatever your putting on the fabric before packaging and you'll have a decent pair of pants."
Pin is nice quality. The pin backs are crap . They don't stay on . Im going to have get a different back or tape them on
these were missing a least a dozen stones. not even in the box so zero quality control. sent back.
I do not know who thinks this is a large. A size 6 is more like it. Very disappointed.
The smell will make you return it
"The product looks and fits OK, but the fabric is very stiff, and didn't relax even after several washes. Donated to Goodwill."
"I am disappointed in this bra; I thought it would stand up to similar ones I had bought.  It did not. Iam not sure what went wrong as the Bali bras are quite long lasting. Maybe its this style. It gives no support, you may as well not have it on.. will go back to the other styles I have bought."
"These are too small and inconsistent in size. One pair looked like a child's size.
The idea is wonderful. I have neuropathy in my toes and socks without toes allows me to keep my food warm but not put any pressure on my toes. Let me know when the maker gets the sizes better. I might but again if larger size."
I really thought this bag will not be so ugly...but it is. It looks dirty and wrinkled. it is a good size...but please a better material it will be nice.
"I ordered this item twice, and both times the leggings arrived with holes in the knee."
"I wear size small, bought a large, while I like the look of the shirt, is doesn't fit properly around the arms. One shoulder is wider than the other. Where the sleeves meet the shoulder is just to narrow. The area just above the bust and around the underarms are too tight. Thread hangs from everywhere, It is poorly tailored. The style is nice but whoever made this shirt just cannot sew."
"Good chance this has a lot to do with my feet.  I felt the shoes were a little tight in the toe box, and I don't have wide feet.  I was hoping these shoes would help an issue I've been having that I should probably see the doctor for, but just don't want to if I mustn't.  I have flat-feet, I over-pronate, have mildly wimpy ankles, am slightly overweight, hate running and the outside of my foot feels like it is going to break in half/shatter when I run.  These shoes had the outsides of my feet hurting in under 1/4 mile on the treadmill...I'm just glad I have a treadmill in my home so I could return them.  Guess I'm back to Mizunos Wave Inspire.
On another note - definately this shoe review, I've never bought a pair of shoes before where the insoles weren't even mildly attacked to the shoe, the way these came in the box I thought maybe it was a second insole and pulled it out because it so loosely sat in the shoe...it wasn't a second insole.  Maybe that's all Asics, I don't know - but I personally found it odd."
"HI, I CANT FIND WHERE IS IT MADE IN? CAN ANYONE HELP ME WITH THIS PLEASE?
I WILL BE VERY GRATEFULL. THANKS"
It didn't do anything
"This is did not fit at all.  I got two in the mail,  one was perfect and was looked like it was for a child.  I ended up giving it my niece. I am 5'4 and it cam up to my knees."
Poor stitching!
"My daughter has size 3 almost 4. According to a size chart she needed ""toddler"" version. I got them today. They are literally on toddler. The size  is on 1 ich bigger than provided picture of these socks. She will never fit in and she has performance in 2 day. I will have to return them."
I returned the shoes because they were to small and did not fit.  They looked like they were well constructed but the wrong size.
"These were small, and tight around the toe. At the sole of the shoe directly under the ball of my foot I could feel an odd round lump that made them so uncomfortable. I returned these with no problem."
"These felt cheap, and not like the Teva's I remembered having as a kid. I kept them cause I didn't have anything else to bring for a beach vacation. But wish I swapped out for a bigger size or different sandal altogether."
Got this as a gift for a friend who lost her cat. She was very excited about getting this. Well the top screw broke when she put her kitty ashes in.  So sad for my dear friend. Sucks.
At least 2 sizes to small.
"All tangled up out of the box, had to throw away."
"The copy I received (and returned) didn't look nearly as rich in color, nor as weathered as the photo.  In was an nondescript monotone matte brown.  It is also pretty heavily insulated - more so than I wanted, adding to bulk."
"Serious lines from these hipsters. The lace waistband is very cheap and rolls over on itself. I ordered the same size as the Bali hipsters I bought several years ago and these were snug. So my advice, if you are determined to get them despite my warning,  is to order these at least one size larger than the size chart indicates, and don't be surprised if you end up with panty lines anyway."
"The picture makes it look very soft and feminine, but the color is really bright!  I ended up returning it since it was more like neon pink."
Nothing like the true garnet color looks more orange in color in fact clashes with my other garnet jewelry
"Meh, wore them twice and was over it. Material was thin but scratchy, too high waisted, couldn't roll them down really bc of the drawstring. Not comfortable and that was kind of the point."
"Way, way too small. Everything about it . The chain, and the pouch seems as though it was made for a child...."
believe the other reviews.. there is no space in the groin area.. fit is really weird.
"Fast shipping and at first the quality was wonderful, however after just a few weeks of wearing three of the stones fell out."
Cheap. Cheap. Cheap. Already broke. Sad. It was very pretty.
"I was really searching for Dockers, which is a brand he uses and knows quite well, but the website led me to this brand. I am sure i shouldnt have picked the pleated style. The legs are veeery wide."
"I don't notice any difference after using this product. When I applied it as necessary the blemishes remained. I didn't feel or look any different.

And, I have to agree with other reviewers complaining about the text on the bottle. It's tiny, black print, against a frosted, dark orange glass.

It just felt like I was applying this serum in vain, and I love Juice Beauty products, too."
"At first, hubby loved them.  One year of hardly any wear, the zippers started giving him problems.  They are now a piece of junk after normal wear for two winters (to and from work in the vehicle, but no hard work in them) because the snaps and zippers are falling apart.  I wish these were better quality because then we would be repeat customers.  Looking for a new brand now.  This has sullied the name of the Dickies brand for us.

Then we found out that Dickies would replace them!  This made us so happy... at first.  But after spending two whole months of dealing with Dickies customer service, they ""lost"" the record of our first two phone calls with them despite the girl remembering my DH, kept saying changing what they would offer to replace the overalls with, and finally (4th call) ended up offering to replace them with an inferior Walls brand (the zippers on the legs do not come up past the knee).  Hubby asked if they would at least throw in a free cap or shirt, and they are sending two cheap knit tomboggans with the Dickies logo.  Sorry, but we won't be advertising such bad service!!!  NO MORE DICKIES purchases for us!!!

Previous review when they were new..."" My husband loves these.  He formerly owned a pair of the regular insulated bib overalls by Dickies.  The difference in these are that the leg zippers begin higher at the hip so that he can zip down to reach into his jeans pockets.  He says they feel wonderful.  For some reason he could not snap the ankle snaps on his older pair but can on these while wearing his work boots.  He is 5'11 and got a short, and they fit almost perfectly in length."""
"I would not buy again, it's on the cheap side."
"This skirt looks so cheap in real life. The lining is only three quarters of the length of the skirt and the fabric is so thin that this is very obvious. In the photo I thought the pattern looked subtle and tasteful but in reality it is very garish and tacky. Also, the waist is tiny. I wear a small and this is too tight.
One redeeming quality are the little wooden beads on the decorative tie. They are very pretty. I had to return this skirt."
"The little plastic ridges fall off.  Mine were about 6 months old before they fell off.  Find them all over the house and now big holes where they used to be in sandle.

Really stupid design."
"too BIG! The ear warmers are too big and the bow around the head is too big, also they itch a little."
"the material is good, however it was too large and I had to return it. I gave it 1 star because they do not pay for return shipping."
"It can't support its own weight on your ear. They quality is worse than the picture portrays, but it was suuuuuuper cheap."
LOVED everything about these shoes Except that they had no arch support which made it impossible for me to stand in them for more than a minue and walking was nearly impossible.
The cut is extremely small and the quality isn't the best.  It's also pretty annoying not to be able to put them in the dryer.
I always wear a 36b and this was waaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyy too small. Don't waste your money because they won't give you a full refund
"Too snug around my foot, and not very comfortable.  I assume ordering a size up might help, but the shoes weren' that great to begin with."
"They  were a little tight when I first wore it, then when they were washed it shrunk up something awfully same thing with underw"
"It was too small for me. The color was pretty, but the bag just seems way too small."
"This jacket looks awful. I ordered a medium based on the reviews I read (normally I'm a small)... It's too big in the waist. The fabric is what I can only describe as a comfy sweatshirt / thick yoga pant material, which looks cheap in my opinion. It came with no shipping, receipt, or return information. I didn't expect much at this price point, but I expected more that what I got. Now I have to figure out how to return."
Because of reviews I ordered two sizes up. 2x equals an XL. Not a dress.
Invicta you can do so much better watch is really pretty but band feels really cheap I wonder how long is gonna last with out braking cuz the band feeling so cheap I guess you get what you pay ..  guys find something better!!!!!!!!!
"I did read all the reviews concerning sizing, but hoped against hope that a size 3XL would fit me.  Unfortunately, it was about 3 sizes too small.  I am around a size 14-16, but I felt this shirt was around a size 8-10.  I know they are meant to be quite fitted, but the waist elastic in particular was incredibly tight.  It's unfortunate, since the colors are very bright and it looks like a nice shirt - but of course that doesn't help if it doesn't fit."
The material so cheap looking I will not wear this at all. I waste my money
Shirt and hood are way to small. XXL can fit a elementary school kid.
"My wife wears a size 7 1/2 shoe and she has many other foot jewelry. The indicated size stating 7 to 8 is wrong, the item sent would fit perhaps a size 9 to 10."
"I was super excited to get these because I was expecting the same fur lining that is in my classic Uggs.  WRONG.... the only thing that is fur lined is the foot bed.

The sweater material covering the toe is very thin and I can see my toes through it when I lift my foot to walk.  I don't see this material lasting very long.  Expected better for $160.

Super disappointed :(

Thank you Amazon for having free shipping and free returns."
"Nice cotton, but way too small. I had to give them away."
"My 1st grader, who carries only a folder  and a lunch box in his backpack, used this 3 times before the top ripped open.  It looks nice, but is made of poor materials.  Spend a few extra dollars and get one that will last."
"such a disappointment. I have ordered several other vests, from six star uniforms and they fit perfect.....this one must be for kids...ordered a 5X and it must be a medium....I didn't pay much for it, so no sense in returning it...wish they had the right size listed...."
"Oh dear!  This garment (raglan sleeve blouse, white, size L) is ridiculously  huge!  For reference, I'm 5' 8 1/2"", 140 pounds, 38C, size 6 pants, size L or XL in tops and I like generously cut clothes.

On me,  it looks like a mass of cloth; on a bigger person, the lines would be good. I love the collar and the pockets.  It's 88% linen, 12% cotton. That's enough linen to be  a pretty high maintenance garment, but it does look classy when done right.

For a taller woman with long arms, size 16 or 18, it would be a great shirt, just sadly, not for me."
nope nope nope
"The lift part needs to be made of the same material as the pasties, but neither lays flat enough for thinner fabric tops. I wasn't really thrilled with the quality. The lifts didn't really lay on the skin well at all."
"No,no,no,no. Not even for your grandma."
"I ordered this based on good review, but the piece I received does not feel the same quality  as other Mordenmiss clothes I bought. Send it back."
"Cheap plastic - looks cheap, would not recommend."
I thought this was just a baseball cap with the Mario logo on it. It does have a baseball style bill but the hat itself is puffy and made of shiney silk like material. Oh well it will work for Halloween instead of every day use
The wig was nice looking but it didn''t begin to fit.  Had to ask for a credit.
Bought them for a wedding and they got a run in them that ended up creating a big hole all the way down the back of my right leg while I was putting them on. I had to go without them...
Great colorful socks. Bad things are the fabric is thin and does not stretch well.
"Does not feel like high quality leather, the middle compartment to store cards in is too loose and cards readily fall out when the wallet is turned upside down - this being a new wallet I would expect the leather to be more firm now than later and if cards are already falling out this is only going to get worse, I don't want to trust a wallet holding my credit cards if they are already popping out. I feel that I payed too much money for this product and wish I could return it. Save yourself some money and purchase a different companies wallet.

After reading other reviews I don't see many people with the same problem of normal credit cards falling out of the pockets so maybe this company has poor quality control and the assembly varies per wallet. Either way, I won't be using this product.

Does get 2 stars for attractive look, thats about it."
"Poor quality rendered it unwearable almost instantly.  While my daughter likes this dress, the extra layer of tulle ripped after just one wear. She didn't even go outside that day. It looked weird and strangely puffed originally anyway, so I considered removing the top layer all together, but it wasn't possible.  After one wear, this was relegated to play clothes, only to be worn in the back yard.  I wash all of her dresses gentle cycle wrong side out and hang dry, but the top layer continues to come off.  It was not expensive, but I get more wear out of stuff I buy at Wal Mart than I got out of this dress. I wouldn't buy it again."
Is to small for a large size
"The photo does not match the chain that I received.  The chain I received is extremely delicate.
I have returned the item."
The shorts are a little loose and the material isn't as soft and light as I had expected.
I am size 2 and usually wear small /x small. But this bra runs too small to try it on.
I don't recommend it!!
"Look nice but the finger loop broke off, very disappointed"
this runs REALLY small
I recieved it quickly unfortunately it was too small.
"These boots ran big, also were uncomfortable just trying them on at home for a few minutes.  Also do not like that the top is so loose fitting because I have smaller calves and the material is flimsy and doesn't stay up straight.  I have other pairs of not rated boots that I love but I just wasn't liking these at all."
Just revived my backpack in the mail today. As I open it I see loose sticking throughout the backpack. I would not recommend
"The bracelet is very large and heavy. The chains are nearly as large as a man's keychain. Some of the charms are nearly 1 inch.  This is too large for a bracelet, especially for a slight or elderly woman.  I'll try to return it"
"These are just ok. I'm only 5' 10.5"" but the medium longs are still a bit short. I certainly wouldnt put them in the dryer. Also for the price point, the quality isn't terrific. I'm already getting pilling after 1 day of thighs brushing together on a walk. And my thighs don't touch that much!  I miss Target's C9 pants that were similar but thicker and better quality."
Beautiful.  Stunning.  Broke on first day. Beads went everywhere.  Not meant for big wrists.
Too high in the back. Very little compression. Actually made my postpartum pooch feel more pronounced. Sadly I've missed the return window (which was far shorter than most Amazon products) so I'm stuck with them. They run large.
Don't buy it .. Trust me ..
"Shoes looked nice but too narrow, couldn't even get my feet into them.  Returned, thank you Amazon Prime."
The green flecks in the stone aren't really green.  The photograph is misleading. I wanted a green ring.  What I received was a black stone with indistinct tan colored flecks in the stone.
larger than anticipated and did not like the material
Both pair are very uncomfortable!
"Cuts into back of ankles HORRIBLY.
Don't was your money!!!"
So this bra was delivered 2 days ago. TWO DAYS AGO!! It's completely ruined. I'm sad because I usually love these reusable adhesive bras. This is my first time with this brand and dang...
Ran small had to return it.
"Seams tore too easily.  Great for our gym bag but disappointed in the craftmanship, especially from Adidas."
"These are the most ill fitting pants. They are too small around the wasteband, then way too baggy in the legs."
The sizes ordered wasn't what I received. I ordered a 7.5 in women's and received a 7.5 in means and a 9.5 in women's. Is it possible to send them back for a correct size?
This product feels like a pantyhose. Very very light and feels very synthetic.
"Sizing is inconsistent.  I bought 2 pairs, one pair fits well, the other is too tight.  Seam also fell out of one pair.  I have never bought these jeans through Amazon before, maybe they sell the seconds here.  The ones I have bought directly from Dickies fit fine."
"Not long enough for an adult neck. I am waiting to find an extension, otherwise it is gorgeous!"
"The Maidenform Sleek Smoothers Hi-Waist Boyshort Shapewear is supposed to give a sleeker look making things a bit smoother. Unfortunately, this light shapewear doesn't give the sleek look, but instead adds more problems. The way the top is designed allows it to roll and give more bulk. Unlike some of the other Maidenform shapewear, this only has the silicone type grip lines in the back and not the front. This allows it to not only slide down but roll.

This also fits a bit too loose for my taste. I want something a little tighter and not be able to slide down."
"I've only had these for two months and they already suck, the cheap, imitation wool inside comes out after a week or two. I guess you should wear socks with them I don't know, either way they cause your feet to sweat and eventually rot. I should have passed them up, the box they were shipped in would have made better clogs, Seriously! Not recommended!"
Too tight on the ankle and calf.
"while I love this brand and thought these shoes would be good for fall, HOWEVER the Velcro in the back did not stay closed making them useless & I had to return them"
I should have gotten a size 8-81/2 these were way to small but the size said 71/3 which is what I wear. I returned them
"Ok I read review before offering so I size up. I was wrong, I got an XL and I was so disappointed when I received item. It was wayyyyy to big. I need maybe a M size so I contact the sell and was told I can't return item and that I wouild have to contact Amazon to return it I guess through them"
"Love the shirt...
I read some people find it too thin...well it is thin and great for warm environments.
It drapes really well...it doesn't blouses at all.
I really like it.  I would give it 5 stars but I don't know how well it will hold up yet.
(I bought 2 at the same time...the other is a orange-ish pattern (very attractive))
EDIT  11/16:
The shirt is pilling...I don't understand it.
EDIT  8/28
I only ended up wearing this shirt a few times. fabric was horrible."
Fit about 2 sizes smaller
"Cool shoes, apparently comfy, but way too small!  My husband ordered a 12 - he can vary between a 12 and a 13 in shoe size.  The 12 didn't fit him at all.  It appears that if we order the 13 that it will snuggly fit.  Not ordering again.
We returned them.

Shame cuz the design was awesome :("
Didn't look like picture and too big.  I know my ring size
"Looks good, but runs very tight.  Watch out for the dryer!!  should lay this jacket out damp to dry!!!!  Still small"
"The bra has no support at all for an underwire bra, will not buy this bra again.  Use to lounge around house, cannot wear under good clothing because no support."
The wallet is too small and it will not stay closrd with mininum amout of items.
First time in over 30 years I have been disappointed with a NB product.  I work six to ten hour shifts on my feet and these simply did not measure up.  A big disappointment
"Yes, these are extremely warm. Yes, the fit is perfect but THEY ITCH. I couldn't wear these for any prolonged time. At this price I really am disappointed.

I realized they are shearling but they should not be designed in such a way that I can't even wear them without feeling like I need to constantly take them off and scratch my ears. I have UGG boots and even UGG flip flops (where the straps are lined ontop of the foot). Neither the boots nor the flip flops cause itching issues."
Jacket is made well I have had this type of jacket for 13 years . I bought this one and the quality is excellent but the cut and size is different this jakect is short for regular size . So I bought tall and the arms are way to long and I have the same size jacket that is 13 years old so I can't find the same fit dickies anymore and no I did not gain weight I am the same weight the size changed no me
Not even close to the color pictured. Really disappointed
DO NOT PURCHASE!! Very poor quality and pants weren't even hemmed!
Returned - not attractive in person. Looked cheap.
Nicely made but bulky
Needs to have a sizing chart. This was to small for my grandson. I was very disappointed!
"I fell in love with this wallet when I got it, first wallet I bought in almost 10 years, the canvas on the inside (right side card holders) has split and torn, I've had the wallet for a few months now, this happened in the first month, but it holds what I need and I do like it, I just expected a lot higher quality from Carhartt."
It can ripped along the seam all the way up the side.  Very cheaply made  I am giving this 2 stars instead of 1 because they did give me my money back but it was a hassle because they do not take returns
Way to rigid....4 of them broke trying to lace to the shoe.
Love them but they are knock offs couldn't tell from pic so 3  only
"Too small, I wear a size 12 shoe"
"Sole seperated after 2 times wearing it.
Not as good as store bought pairs I have had before..."
"This is an exceptional Belt but way too small the lenght of the belt itself, in the other hand the belt is so nice and exceeded my expectations"
"It fit when first tried on, a bit more on the ""fitted"" side...then washed it and it shrunk! Not cool. So order up one size unless you want it tight and short in the sleeves."
Terrible.... looks nice but no holes to breathe through
"The fabric is terrible, the sleeves are weird and it makes you look like a balloon. not flattering."
"This thing is not for a women with a booty or body lol......it's definitely made for the more athletic lady's.......does not fit at all, but it did come in a nice little pink reusable hand bag."
"Do not buy these!  After a 5.5 mile hike, the hard rubber treads were peeling off the front of my shoe, exposing the soft white cushioning.  Rocks were cutting into the cushioning and I was concerned about being able to finish my hike without injury.
I called ASICS, because I have loved their shoes for years.  The rep said that there was another shoe a couple of years ago that had to be recalled because of a bad adhesive.  I think this is another case where that is what needs to happen.
I will continue to buy ASICS, as long as this doesn't happen again.  Skip this shoe..."
.99 cent wroth!
and not well made at all I need to return them
"Very pretty, however, the mask was more of a yellowish white than pure white.  Also there was a huge black dot in the middle of the mask.. I wonder if the people who pack items into the box look at what their packing.. This dot was very noticeable.. I wish there was a way to insert a picture so u guys can see for urself"
my husband could only wear it for picture and we had to give it away -- WAY TOO Small and Tight
Returned it to small not what I expected
Not happy with the quality and fit.
"My foot is not that wide, I wear a medium width with no problems. This shoe was very narrow, I could barely get it on. Sadly, I will be returning them."
"The kids refuse to wear them because they are too itchy. I guess you get what you pay for. They're just poorly made, low quality material, and very itchy."
"Excited to find this but alas, not to be.  I wear size 4 in pants and dress and this was absolutely too big.  Also noticed
the back gap thing, yuck !!!.  The description did not say where the waistband sat but looked close to or just below waist.  This sat
way too far below waist for my liking."
"its just ""ok""....armholes waaaaay to large"
Nothing like photo awful
"The shoe fits wonderfully and comfortably.  But... the quality of the actual shoe has decreased massively since I bought my 1st pair and this 2nd pair.  From a wonderful, long lasting shoe (1st pair), to HORRIBLE and shockingly bad shoe (2nd pair, this purchase).

I've marked the shoe as 1-star because the pair I received has fallen apart over a 2 month period of infrequent and mild use.

I saw other reviews noting a decrease in quality by Skechers and dismissed it because my first pair was so comfortable and lasted for a long time with no issue.  Well, this second pair is literally the worst quality of shoe I've owned over too many years.

Over a period of weeks, with very minimal use, the seams have come unraveled.  Most recently, I've noticed that the leather upper has actually TORN... a 2"" tear, not at the seam but a 1/4"" away from a seem.

I'd return these, but I am outside the Amazon return period.  I called the Sketcher customer service like, and they kindly responded that they would forward a note on my concerns but would take no action.

I am so disappointed in the decrease in quality of this shoe.  It is so darn comfortable.  Hope they fix this."
"Poor quality, poor quality , and are twice put peeled and horrible , I demand my money back"
"Based on the reviews, I expected these pants to be great.  Wrong!  They were very tight in every area.  The rise is so short that they rode up into my private area.  The color is nothing like the picture and the overall fit was off.  When I put them on one of the legs had the seam showing on the front of my leg.  I had to physically turn the pant leg around to face the right way.  Not impressed at all.  They were $21.99 and I found a much better pair at Macy's for about the same price."
"Way too small,  it's more of a children's size then adults"
"Be careful when you order, make sure it's not from china. China sizes are not what you think. This shirt is suppose to be 2xl but it's more like a large. I gave the shirt to my little cousin."
"Comes out of the laundry very wrinkled, fits pretty small, and too short to remain tucked in. Much better t-shirts can be bought to wear with a military uniform."
Way smaller than advertised...
"A fairy's long earrings.  Sad to say, not great workmanship."
My son kept tripping and falling because it was a little too big for him at just under 2 years of age.  I have yet to try it again on him to see if it fits better now 10 months later.  I wouldn't get it for an average sized child who just turned 2 though.
This item shrink a lot
Way too small and if you do order go 2 sizes larger
"These are not thermals. You get what you pay for with this product. They're pretty cute when you pull them out of the package. I bought these to wear under fleece lined leggings and other warm things while camping. They did almost nothing. Another layer is another layer, but my camping companion wore similarly priced thermals for men and was fine in just those on our coldest night.
The first time I wore them all night, the butt developed a run where the fabric is thinnest.
If you're looking for the shaping aspect, they offer very very little structure. I am thin, but still have fat on me and this didn't do anything to hide it or make it worse.

BOTTOM LINE:
If you're looking for cheap, cute, and comfy spring/fall indoor pajamas, order a size up to avoid developing a run.
If you're looking for cheap thermals, go for a waffle or fleece lined set. These are not worth the money."
The hat came misshapen and it kinda flops around on your head.
I have genuine quality concerns.
"Darker blue then shown. I am 5'8 156lbs and these ""thigh high"" socks come just below my knee cap. That was the biggest let down fifteen bucks wasted. I could have lived with the off color but I was looking for thigh highs not high calf socks. x( FAIL"
"The look was great, but the fit was not for me.  I am hippie and they seemed lower then mid rise."
"I've worn Eccos, which I bought while living in Europe. The quality has gone way down with these shoes. Although they look nice, the surely don't look or feel as if they will last. Boo Hoo, Ecco! I had to return them."
This it was obviously worn prior to it being sold as a new costume to me. Disgusting and disappointing.
it was suppose to be here in april..just got it a couple days ago and the clock don't work..  :(
"I LOVE the Viv leggings I have recently been purchasing! I decided I also needed some solid colors since I had purchased all the patterns I liked. These do fit but they are not Viv. I got a brand called Itzon. They are horrible! See through,shiny not seemless! I have more solid colors on the way and will send them ALL back!"
Zipper broke in a month. Not worth price. But style is cute
"Bought one of these year ago and started falling apart so decided to buy another for replacement. 2 months later, stitching is coming out and wallet is ripping. Not even worth the cheap price..."
I ordered the correct size based on the chart for my waist/hips. The pants fit fine in the leg but would barely go over my butt. The material also felt cheap.
"I didn't expect a lifetime from a belt this cheap, but it separated in days. no worth the money."
"The shoe fit great and is very comfortable, but the right shoe is coming apart where the sole meets the leather on both sides with just normal wear."
"The lens will pop out within a week of use. I had the seller ship me a free replacement but even the replacement didn't last long. Save yourself the embarrassment of having your glasses break in public and get something else.

Less than $20 for polarized sunglasses? What do you expect. I bought it on Amazon Prime Day."
I don't like the way it fits. The bottom strap is really tight on your toes which will cause blisters  and there's not much back support. I'll probably never wear these shoes. :(
"Just after a few days of wearing the plastic ""O"" shape pieces from which the laces go in and out of, have come lose. The shoe overall looks cheap for being almost $50. The worst part is that while the shoes are right size and fit, the back of them are cut so low that they feel as though they barely are on my feet and feel like they'll slip off. But perhaps this is how certain styles of shoes are and I am not use to them. I don't usually wear more ""dressy"" style of shoes, maybe these are trying to imitate those.

On a positive note, the slip resistance is excellent, but these shoes only lasted me 4 months before they began to fall apart, I pushed another few months out of them. They are Garbage. But then again, I have trouble keeping good shoes.

These are nothing like my ""Jack Runners"", 7 year old dying Nike Running shoes I bought for running, but I fail at running (just like life) and began wearing them for work as they were ugly but comfortable. My Jack Runners only recently began to fall apart as I only began to use them for running again. (Well let's be honest, mostly running for half a minute and then walking and heaving for 30...)"
"I love Keen shoes and have owned several pairs, including the Marshall waterproof hiking shoes which has similar features to the Logan.

These did not meet my expectations. The plastic outer sole was bulky in all the wrong places, and the insoles felt like I was wearing the shoes on the wrong feet. (I checked, I wasn't.) The plastic also showed some obvious manufacturing defects in that there were smudges and nicks around the sides.

In short, these were not consistent with the Keen quality I have experienced in the past. I returned these and purchased the Saltzman waterproof hiking shoes instead and they are SO MUCH better."
"I really wanted to like these flats. They look super cute, and came in the mail quickly. They also fit true to size. The reason i'm giving them one star, however, is that i've worn them TWICE, for less than an hour each time, and they have a hole in the bottom already. The rubber ripped right open on the bottom like it was nothing. Very cheaply made, good for a one-time use if you just need something to go with an outfit. But don't expect them to last long."
they issued me a refund which was great! Sadly the item was way to small.
"I had read the reviews that said these scarves came from two different sellers, so I was careful to choose one that said ""TrendsBlue"".  I was disappointed when the scarf arrived (in the wrong color no less....I ordered dark gray and got a light, silvery gray).  When I rechecked my order history, it did, infact, say sold from Silver Hooks.  I don't know how I missed it.  But even as I write this review, the description again says Trends Blue.  I dunno.  But I returned mine."
Way too small. My daughter is unable to wear only 2 of these below the knuckles
"Very bad quality, it brokes at the first day of wear it. It is not completely gold. Se can not Buy jewelry at Amazon"
"This was too long & too tight at first but when I washed it and stretched it out a bit, it was better."
"I usually believe an Wranglers, but this time i totally waste all my money because it is so large, website is differ from my order, just i hate it"
"Tapers shouldn't even be sold. So dangerous, an cause tear and blow outs. Bought these before I knew. Just buy a pair of single tape glass or implant grade steel."
"Washed the pants before I tried them on so I'm stuck with them. They are at the 3"" if not 4"" to small in the waist. The legs fit extremely tight. The most disappointed that I have ever been in Amazon."
Could never set the time.  Rip off from day 1.
"Too large, buckle didn't work is too long"
very bad manufactured.
Not what I wanted. It's not like the picture. The color was more like gray.
Way too small and even though Im only 53 the dress way too short.
Not brown at all very yucky rust red color.
Sorry is my mistak
cheap cheap cheap - these were terrible.  I returned them.
I've ordered these twice and both times received the wrong size.  What a pain to send them back and then receive the wrong size and start all over again.
"Oh, it fits alright, as long as I don't move.
If you are looking for a bra that does not ride up over your boobs every time you move your arms, then don't buy this one."
"I bought these for work. They fit and feel great. Last week in the morning I noticed a small hole on my knee. By the end of the day the small hole was not small, my entire knee was exposed,  every time I bent down or squatted the hole just got bigger. Now I have a small hole just above my knee on the second pair. It was the size of a pencil tip this morning. Now it is the size of a 2 entire pencils and getting bigger. I have never seen this before. I was not at work today and just cleaning around the house. In both cases I don't know what even caused the hole. I have one pair left. I will see what happens. I have worn wrangler before and never had this problem. I got these because they stated rugged. I threw the first pair out because I could not wear them to work, I am saving the second pair, but as of now I cant wear them to work. Looks very unprofessional. I don't complain often but I am at a loose for these jeans crumbling."
I am so very disappointed in this Shoe. I have plantar fasciitis and these shoes do not help. I just spent $150 for nothing!
Broken. Right out of the box. I bought it a month before my daughter's birthday so it was past the 30-day return by the time she opened it.
Somewhat small and fabric is rough and scratchy.
Horrible fit!!!
I really liked the way this looked on with no seems but I was pulling it on and the rubber underneath ripped and there is no way to fix it so I would have to order another one. No Bueno. The straps dug into my arms and if you forget to take the straps off before you  wash it...
"The item that was sent to me was already worn and returned by someone else. It had rub marks and a hole near the crotch as if someone too big attempted to wear it. I am little disgusted by the rub sweat marks, but I could simply wash the item for that. But the hole is a no go."
"This shirt looked really cool in the picture, but when it arrived i was a little disappointed. The model in the pic makes it look like it's a form fitting tunic top with low-key pockets. In fact, the pockets are pretty bulky, and if you're not a model, it makes you look like you have really chunky fat hips, or love handels. I'm 4'11' and 105lbs, so yeah I'm short, but i'm not chunky, and this was really unflattering. The shirt itself was not form fitting in the waist - it had a lot of bulky extra fabric in the back so it just made me look fat all around the middle area, which i'm not - super not cool.

I tried to send it back, but the seller was super reluctant (shady) and convinced me to keep it to save on shipping cost if they gave me 30% back (which was like $4, big whoop). So i just kept - it wasn't that expensive to begin with, it was just the principle that the item did not fit at all like it did on the model in the picture.

The shirt is a cool design, i love the pockets, and it looks OK with a belt to cinch in the non-form-fitting waist, but if you wanted to wear this by itself, or already have a chunky waist/hips, this will probably not be flattering."
"I ordered size medium/large and it's so tight, I won't wear it."
Petal Print is not made the same as white and black colors. Fabric on side bands is a single layer instead of the double layers on the white and black. Therefore it stretches more and makes the bra loose. Kept riding up even on the tightest setting. Just doesn't hold like the other colors.
"They didn't even make it through a day without ripping, and as soon as they hit the water they disintegrated."
"My son found these comfortable, and the colors were bright, but after 8-10 times wearing them the straps started scuffing and peeling. Not the quality I expected. Bought a different pair (same brand) for my daughter and that material is holding up beautifully!"
"I usually wear a small or medium, so ordered medium in this, and it was way too tiny. It's skin-tight, so if you are not perfectly skinny like a model, it will hug every bit of extra skin and added pounds you may have and maybe not even realized! It also is incredibly short. I'd highly recommend buying at least one, possibly two sizes up. I'm going to just donate this shirt to Goodwill, since I can't hardly fit into it. For reference, I am 5'6"" and 130 lbs."
"This coat is much like the variety that can be purchased at your local Walmart. It makes a decent rain slicker, that's all. Not worth the $."
I gave it away and she loves it
Love the look-but is a little short. Returning them for a bigger size-1/2 size up. Got many compliments on the color!
"The lining looks used.  The bottom of the slippers do not look as if ever used, so I am keeping them. My husband looked them over real well and believes they were never used. Because of the look of the lining though, I don't like them."
"I ordered a larger size  too make a comfortable fit and they were bigger than anticipated, although I love the color and material with the high waist."
"Broke the first time used, cheaply made."
This piece is a great design but the dragon chain broke.
Very disappointed.. do not have time or energy to return... cheap made and sized extra extra small... not true to size
"Not worth it, first time I wore them after walking a day they slide to my ankles.  Very disappointing"
Did not fit well toe was uncomfortable
"Very cheap and tacky looking, it was stringing when I received it. I was so upset because I purchased it for a first date and had to purchase a whole new dress. I am highly disappointed "
After a month of wearing - the face fogged up & cant see the face anymore!
"nice shirt. the material is to flimsy for the gym, i wear it around the house.."
"Not fit at all.
Small size.
Not happy with product.
I will enjoy to use this shoes,but the size is incorrect"
First you must be aware that you WILL have to modify the watchband by cutting excess parts of it to fit a normal wrist size...period. The rubber is very stiff and does not cut easily. I basically ruined the one I purchased. Buy the normal two piece wrist strap instead which is what I wish I had done.
One of the stockings consitently fell off my leg every 10 or so minutes as well it ripped after the first wearing it.
Too small.  Size runs one size too small based on other shirt purchases.
"As gloves, they're great. They work. They're warm, but not so warm that my hands sweat.

However, the ""touch screen"" feature -- doesn't work at all."
"this shawl is absolutely lovely except that it is not pictured well here. In order for it to drape like the picture it would have to be on a child or very very small adult. I'm an average size 12 trim lady... but it's too small to drape this way. It barely fits around the shoulder and ties. I will not wear it, but will gift it to my tiny niece for Christmas."
the shoe says 3 and my daughter wears a 2 1/2 but this show will not go on her feet at all.
"When I saw this coat, I was really excited for it to arrive in the mail. When it came, I was really disappointed to discover that it was made out of a cheap, ultra-thin material and the fit was not ideal. If you have an athletic build, this is not for you, unless you want to look like you are wearing a female's coat. I was able to return it, but at my expense ($14), which was rather disappointing."
"Very cute and decently made, but way way too small. If you can, order at least two sizes larger than you would normally wear."
"don't buy this product. you won't be happy. I am 90 lbs at 5'2"" and I should have order an extra large to even be able to slip it on. The material is very cheap and the strings - I couldn't figure them out to save my life. Good luck trying to find hose that will attach to this THING! Bad mistake on my part ordering. I would not have taken it even if they gave it to me free. SO BUYER BEWARE! 5.00 to ship it also. It could have been put in a reg, envelope that is how tiny it is.."
"The quality of the bracelet is fine, the size is very large and do not fit my 5 yo twin daughters.  I contacted the company regarding the large size and their response was that it's a standard kid's size in silicone bracelets and are designed to fit a wide range of kids."
The straps have a mind of their own and want to teist up -- irritating.
It was nothing like the the picture ran small I even order bigger size still way to small
"Not as advertised,does not have lace trim and a terrible customer service."
These shrank and faded very badly after the first wash. A size 14 fit more like a 12. Very tight at the waist.
Wrong color!!
"Bought it used, it was dirty, wouldn't stay synched with my Samsung s5.
I'll never buy anything used again"
looks cheap
Cheap looking.  I doubt it I'll wear it!
"They fit great until I washed them, they shrunk about 6 inches. Bummer because the material is really nice.  I wanted them a little long, they shrunk to ankle length."
Sorry to say these boots were a big disappointment! There not water proof as I found out one rainy day! Got home after wearing these are couple of hours my feet were soaked! talked about ringing out the socks. I decided to give one start for being warm before the storm.
"Washed in cold water and  hung to dry and it shrunk two sizes! Otherwise very nice,  so I'm giving it to a friend"
"VERY disapointed! NOT true to size, AND, front closure was plastic and difficult to work, so I sent it back the next day.
and requested a refund, which was approved immediately! UPS came and picked it up and refund was applied to my
acct."
These Golf Shoes are cheap imitation CRAP made in China!  I'll use these during bad weather then throw them in the garbage.  They are counterfeit Adidas!
"I would have given this one star but my daughter was able to put them on her teddy near and play with them. But these suck otherwise, it's a toy."
its too small and tight
"These are so small I can't get them on my feet. I've tried break them in by wearing around the house but it didn't work. They are pretty and well made, just wish they fit."
Odd shape.  Neck streched out and ill fitting.  Will return.
"My wife has worn Clarks for many, many years. She knows her size, so she was shocked when she couldn't get her foot in this shoe while wearing a very thin sock. She doesn't think the next half size larger would work. Clark should not make this shoe."
fell apart almost imediately
These are nothing like the Crocs I have worn in the past.  They are HARD and not flexible.  There is no arch support.  I am on my feet in the restaurant industry and was looking for good closed-toe shoes that could wipe clean and were lightweight.  I am returning them.
Too tight.  I was trying to order the right size by using the chart size and reading posts but it still didn't help me find my correct size. So I returned it.
Not what I expected at all..
"Way to small, don't bother unless you are about 12 years old. Very unhappy."
"Super cute but super small. Panties do not fit at all, bust cups too close together. Beautiful detail, love the back closure, but cardboard cups too stuffed full of padding. Looks terrible and unreal under clothing."
Make me sweat not brethable
I ordered an adult size L/XL. What I received was a junior/child size.  Totally useless!
"Too small,  very minimal footed. Not what I expected from the advertisement.  Am returning,  not comfortable."
Too light of A jacket
"Shoe felt comfortable, but my foot is too narrow to even begin thinking about being able to keep then on. Full 1/2 inch too wide on narrowest size. Really like the shoes both style and comfort from cushioning, but the shoe would be worthless to me."
"Honestly the quality is the reason I gave this bra 2 stars but in over other aspect it's not worth the price.  It's band run really small compared to normal bras and I would not consider this high impact.  I'm a 36DD and am bouncing everywhere.  I've only ever worn champion in the past so I can say from experience their other high activity bras hold you down much better.

I would keep looking for the price!"
"Maybe my baby is just ridiculously fat but this was not stretchy enough to fit around her legs or belly without being really tight. I couldn't even get them past her knees. The fabric is kind of thick so theres not much give, but the length is the right length for the size so... if your baby is really skinny and tall these are for you!"
"Way too small, not happy about the size I even went up a size like others suggested. Not worth getting or returning."
"Pieces of crap.  Truly, don't bother.  I'm going to leave them someone where for the homeless to find."
"I don't like it at all .It is not a dress !!!!!!  it is very small top I can say . I ordered xxl ( I wear size 14) I was very disappointed in the quality of this top  It's like a bad costume It is nothing to be compare with the picture on the listing of this item. Note: I received this product for a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. Whenever I buy a product, I always rely on the customer reviews as my best source of information when deciding between similar products. Marketing of products is just that - ""marketing"" - but opinions and reviews from real people, using the real product in real life are the most informative and valuable in my opinion. Information I have provided here is sincere and unbiased. Press YES if this review helped you to get the right decision."
returned - design too loud and bright for me.
Poor quality. Shrunk so much it's not wearable.
Terrible ... received 4 pair not 5 in the package.  And the smallest pair consisted of one stud and a post without anything on the end in the prongs.  I was not happy about them at all!
"These were great at first, but barely a month after wearing them, the flip flop broke which is very disappointing.  This is the second pair of skecher sandals that have done this to me.  Not happy!"
"The suspenders are fine, but one of the clips that you need to keep them suspenders on immediately bent. The clips are definitely flimsy trash. The bowtie is a toy bow tie. It has a plastic clip with thin elastic for the band. For eight dollars, I'm not angry. I usually give as good of reviews as I can give, but I am unfortunately displeased with this product due to the clip issue. These suspenders aren't for really holding up your pants, but they look really neat for cosmetic uses. Even thought he colour on the bow is dull and gross, the colour on the suspenders is nice. I only really bought this for the suspenders anyway. I'm a 5'2"", petite person, and they fit fine. I think this would fit an average sized adult. The bowtie is a child's play bowtie, so maybe it could be fun for children to play dress up with."
This dress is beyond to small I wear a large in everything I ordered a xlarge in Asian sizes because it says order up got an xxlarge an the bottom was a little to big an top wouldn't close its funny I'm not even going to return I'll find someone to wear it but I live the color and quality
"The Shoes are Not as well made as( the Other ones i bought sanuk) I get what i pay for.. The bottoms of these are porous and the portion that is made of the actual yoga mat is Much thinner than that the other brand. and then there is a piece of Hard cloth wrapped around each side and around the Toe ! where us Ladies put our delicate Toes.. not fun to get Blisters..ouch !Rather than sending back, I chose to remove the cloth and replace with cloth of my own. a Silk material. and will wear..for however long they last. from now on. i will stick with buying the other brand. Sanuk."
This product is so small it does not fir my head even with some of the snaps on the crown of the hat unsnapped. The hat is also incredibly stiff and very hard to wear. I Would have liked a little softer hat for all day wear.
"Buckle shows wear, not sure that i got a brand new product or someone's returned product. Not very happy about it."
nice but with defects... the chain is poorly made...
The quality is not what I thought. Looks like it was made in china. The decal looks like it was glued on. What a disappointment.
Terrible. Didn't straightening my hair at all and very awkward to use. Seriously don't waste your money...for reference my hair is thick and wavy but nothing a normal straightener can't handle.
"Poorly! put together, but they did refund my money."
Athletic walking? Call it what it is. It's a trail shoe. Skinny in the toe and sole is really hard. They tried to provide the cushioning with insoles instead of the midsole where it should be.
Very cheap fabric and see through.  I ordered it for my wedding to monogram and a set of pink ones for my bridesmaids. I am afraid that they can not wear them as it is more see through than classy.
"My wife wears mediums in EVERYTHING else, sweats, gym gear etc. but this item fits more like a small than a medium."
"i am 5'5 and at the time i ordered i weighed 150 lbs. I ordered a size small. The item i received could easily,i repeat,easily fit someone at least six foot and at least 200 lbs.  . The length is so long that it comes down and actually looks like i am wearing a miniskirt, and the the stringer straps and arm holes are so long and wide the neck scoop is way too low and so the shirt part doesnt even cover my nipples. The straps make it hang that low. This is not sized for people who normally wear a small. I usually wear a medium in a tshirt and this is just ridiculously large. Especially for a small! I will not buy this again. Really too bad because the material is soft and not stiff like others."
"Last update..... After some back and forth with emails the sellers refunded me the full amount I paid for the purse.

Another update.....heard back from the seller. They requested I have it fixed myself and and are willing to refund me a whole $10. REALLY????? PLEASE BE WARNED. THEY SELL JUNK AND ARE NOT WILLING TO REFUND YOU ALL THE MONEY YOU SPENT. THEY ARE A RIP OFF!!!!! I am pissed!!!

When I first received this purse I loved it. Now I HATE IT!!! The one main zipper is broken. It will never zip closed properly.  See picture I posted. I will never buy a purse on here again!!! I'm going to try to contact the seller but I bet I'll be lucky to get my money back!! 

I'm a very picky person when it comes to purses. I get one I like and use it till it falls apart and  I love this. All the pockets make it so easy to keep organized, which is why I'm so picky. I like an organized purse. It took a long time to get here, but I'm very glad I ordered it. I love the backpack feature. Makes it so much easier to carry, especially if it's a long day"
"I have an older version of these shoes from about 6 years ago which I loved, but they are rubber soled so they can not be repaired once you wear down the soles.  I searched the internet looking for a replacement pair (via the model on the inside of the tongue) and found these were the updated version of the Bleeker. $55 seemed like a fantastic deal, so I ordered them.

PROS:
- They are true to their size, my old ones were 10.5D, and these fit just as well
- The insoles are super comfortable.  Even more comfortable than my prior pair and they hugged my feet in the right places
- The styling, seam placement, etc is a good modern casual combination.  A bit different than the older model, but very similar and good.

CONS:
- They are super shiny?  They are so shiny they look like they aren't real leather.
- I sit with one leg over my knee, so the bottom of a shoe is usually exposed.  The big gray and alien-green KORE logo on the heel is unnecessary and cheesy (see pic). Seriously... it's a casual dress shoe, it should not have a big green advertisement on the bottom of it.
- I got these yesterday.  I have worn them for about 6 hours today.  What in the world is going on with the crease line from my toes? (see pic). This is simply not how quality leather behaves.  It is almost like there is a weird alien plastic coating on the shoes that is almost separating from the leather?  I wasn't racing Usain Bolt in these, I sit at my desk and walk back and forth to some meetings.

I will be returning these ASAP.  They were super comfy, but I decided I don't like weird alien leather and that big logo on the bottom is just not really good for an office setting."
The colors were not as depicted. There wasn't a real color like I had hoped. I'm disappointed but too busy to return it.
"i would have returned this but was caring for a sick relative.
this dress weighs more than i do.
it's oppressive and enormous."
"The soles of the slippers don't have ample padding. As a result, they aren't comfortable. I don't recommend them for purchase."
The description 'warm sweatshirt' is an utter lie. This garment is essentially a long sleeve tee shirt YOU CAN SEE THROUGH with a zipper in the front. False advertising.
"Was not what i expected, shoe was too small."
THIS SANDAL FITS A BIT NARROW BUT EVEN WORST IT HAS A BALL OR KNOT OF RUBBER THAT POKES AND HURTS MY ARCH.
"they don't look as in the pictures, it's a trap."
"Material is really stiff, it was packed so that the shape warped a little, but after a lot of effort to straighten it out it still looks cockeyed.  Color is not as depicted. Much darker than the one that looks almost white.. The ""crocodile"" overlay is not centered which further detracts from the look.  Not happy and can't return it since it's been 45 days."
"Ordered a larger cup as suggested by the other reviews, but it was still too small... Couldn't get it on in a flattering way- could only achieve the look of a much older, much saggier woman."
Doesnt look like the picture the color is very light and the quality is not nice
"I've been looking for slip resistant & good support shoes as I work in a restaurant, quite often on my feet for over 10 hours each shift.  Bought these shoes with great expectations but it was a bit tight fit and got a couple of blisters after I worn it a few hours.

Pros:
1) good grip even walking in ""wet kitchen""
2) look cute & delicate
3) Sturdy
Cons:
1) Run small
2) Very hot and make my feet sweat
3) The support it's not as good as it looks as the in-sole is quite hard

I think if you are looking for something for ""causal"" use is great but not for my purpose.

PS: just found out why the shoes are so tight fit! the sizing chart is incorrect on Amazon site, I have ordered the US size 5 (supposingly should be equivalent to UK size 3 or European 35.5 accordingly to the size chart) but when I check the shoes, it's US 5 has became UK 2 or European 35.

It's a shame as I do like the shoes but it will cost me too much to return it from Australia :("
loved the fit of this shirt .. but the product they use to design skull is very uncomfortable very stiff . like the hole front of the shirt does not move with you . tried fabric softener and did not help its bad enough that i can not wear it at all when i sit down top of skull pops up and hits my chin  also waited over a month to be delivered .. don't bother not worth it
fit's nice everywhere the length is entirely too short!
I ordered this dress for my 9 year old great niece.  It was too short and the fit thru the bodice was way too big.  She did not like it.
"Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews. I bought it as an ""add on"" item since I needed just a few more dollars to qualify for free shipping and I was going to attend a private screening of the new Star Wars movie. Needless to say, I was very disappointed in this purchased. You can barely see the light if it comes on at all. At best, it's just a piece of costume decoration. Don't buy this for a child. They won't like it. Very cheaply made. Would have given it a zero or less star."
"Too tight, horrible to walk in.  Gave them to a friend with smaller feet, he likes them."
material was not expected was too big
"I ordered this top in a size medium, which is usually a little big on me, but this top runs small.  The elastic at the arms and shoulders was binding and the top is very translucent.  I could see my nude colored bra clearly under the shirt, which is a shame because I wouldn't want to have to wear another top under it."
"Too small, I was only able to wrap the scarf once around my neck, would not buy again."
I will be returning these shoes. They look they would be comfortable the front of the shoe is very narrow making it uncomfortable and I have average width feet.
"If you have any bulges or rolls, this will showcase them.  Returned."
"The print is cute, but it is too small.  I would order a size or two up."
not flattering on me. may be cute on someone else
I had to return this as it is waaaay shorter in real life than on the model. its basically a very wide shirt. :(
i followed your chart for height and weight but the support hose were way to small.
Will never order again ! Worst item ever! Beware of the company u order from!
"There is no one in their right mind, short of a repeat flasher ""no pun intended"", who would wear this out in public or to a party or parade...You can't see too much on the upper body, but the lower portion of the suit is 100% see through.  You can see it all in this.  And if you do ear underwear underneath it just looks more tacky... I even bought a damn supportive cup and it just wasn't going to workout for me.  There is no way you can wear this in public without being ticketed for lewd conduct.  Has to go back.. Sorry."
"So my friends were trilled with the gift, BUT I thought that the writing was so tiny that no one would ever be able to read it.  So that was really a disappointment.  It looks so clear on the picture.  It looked a lot cleaner and clearer, maybe bigger in the picture, I could read it in the picture.  I could not read the circle in real life.  but it is the thought that counts.  would of probably ordered something else if I had of had the time to send them back.  this was for an annual ""girls"" reunion that I have loved for over 40 years."
NOT WHITE!!!
This wasn't worth the effort if took to order it.  The costume was crammed into the packaging in a way that wrinkled the cheap fabric so bad I don't think you could ever straighten it enough to get it on a child.  The hat doesn't begin to resemble a cowboy hat.  It's going back.
"waist fits good but legs too baggy and pockets too shallow, phone keep falling out"
colour washes out easily although I use woolite
Only wore this once. It constantly rolls up and the straps dig into the sides of your boobs even when they aren't tight. I guess i could safety pin it to my pants or underwear but come on who wants to do that.
Looked nothing like photo. Tiny on top and like  tarp on bottom.
"Really rough edges, not comfortable. Would definitely rub and irritate the skin if worn for a long time."
I'm sure I got a major reject as the sole lining was short and the overall quality was poor for FILA.
"It fell apart after about 2 months, maybe it was just me cause i carried it in my front pant pocket."
"Attractive product. Unfortunately, does not not adhere like the all-silicone version. It kept popping off within the first 5 minutes."
"The shoe does not fit as expected, tight and short, almost covered up when I wear a loose jeans. Not comfortable with light socks."
Material was rough and cheap feeling.
Unfortunately I cannot zip them up all the way up my leg
"Didn't really fit and also didn't control anything I thought it would. I wasn't expecting magic when I put them on, but I was hoping I'd be able to notice a difference in my permanent food baby region."
"Had two weeks and already coming apart at the sole. Don't fit feet properly, heel sits off to the side and causes you to role or pronate your foot."
Sizes run small. I had to return it.
These were cute but did not hold up more than a couple months. Too bad :(
"REALLY DISIAPPOINTED WITH THESE, ABOUT A SIZE AND A HALF TOO SMALL.  I WOULD NO RECOMMEND THEM AT ALL."
Didn't like cup. So I sent it back.
"This shirt is very awkward. The straps are too long so it hangs too low on the body, and not even in a sexy way. It's very soft though"
"9.8 x 7.1 x 3.2 inches; 0.6 ounces. That is what I failed to read. I did read the other reviews and the description which states, if you can roll it you can pack it. People spoke of rolling their shirts, etc. So, I thought this would be great for my trip to Italy to hold my dress tops and slacks. This little thing won't hold my socks. When you read that you can pack so much if you roll it, I was excited. When I opened the box I could not help but laugh. You can't roll much and put it into something 9 inches long by 7 inches wide and 3 inches deep. So, it's my own fault, won't bother to send it back, actually I threw it out."
"I wanted to replace my current traveling backpack and have been searching for quite some time for a top loading one with drawstring close. I was hoping the lining would not be dark since the other Voyagers had colorful lining - but that's not the case with this black LeSportsac.

I liked the capacity of the main compartment - it's large and will hold a lot of items. However, the side pockets were too short to securely hold a water bottle, an important needed feature for me. The fabric also didn't seem tough enough to hold up to frequent use or travel over several years (seems easy to nick and tear) and I'd expect this to last for the price of this pack. Had to return it .. and will keep looking."
Seams were split.
I like the way it fit around my body but the cup is too big.  I ordered the same size I normally wear but the cup just doesn't fit right.  It is hard to fasten all the hooks too.
"Bought for a friend... she would have loved it had it not arrived looking like it would fit a toddler, well OK small teen or 10 year old, not so happy with this one."
Shoe is just too narrow especially in the heel.  Wish they would have worked because I absolutely loved the color!
Feels really cheap
the pants are made from a very thin material so the are see through
Its ugly and it really fits funny not worth the money at all
They look really cheap and are not true to size.
I tried this exact shoe on at a store. The store only had it in red and was not getting anymore in so I opted to order it from Amazon. The shoe was at least 2 sizes too small and not only sqeaked but it smelled like some commercial solvent.
Not a normal garrison boot. More of a inspection last min or temp use
"I tried this on, and one of the buttons popped off. I figured ok, fluke things happen, no biggie. I took it the next day up to a Highlands festival. With one hour of walking from the entrance into the event, the side pocket had torn at the seam, the button for that pocket had also popped off. I had placed my cell phone in this pocket. Nothing crazy. No crazy activities. Literally walking and taking my phone out of the pocket a few times. I expect a little more for something labeled as Utility Kilt, and the words Rugged in its description."
"This bag is so cute and a great size...unfortunately using for two weeks and the seams started to come apart.  For the price, I expected it to last longer than that.  I mainly just used it for a laptop, so it wasn't overly full or anything."
"I love these. But they don't love me. I wear a size 7 in just about all shoes, including several pairs of naughty monkey brand.  However, I can't even get these on my foot in a 7.5. I would probably need approx an 8.5. Skip these due to sizing issues!!!"
I loved this shoe. Had to return because footbed material is slippery and I was afraid I'd walk out of shoe and turn my ankle. A winter shoe should have a footbed made with suede or the like when wearing socks. Really disappointed I had to return.
Dissatisfied with the material love it hate the material I wanna cry because it's not at all good material looks like Halloween costume material :'(
"This top runs very small. I'm normally a large in tops, but this is cut extremely narrow. If you have a large-ish chest size way up or look elsewhere.
Not a fan of the material either. It feels a little cheap."
"RETURNED ITEM.  These ECCO Sandals  do not compare to the earlier Styles and Models of ECCO Sandals The footbed is not comfortable and the arch support actually sits closer to the heel than the arch. Remember I am comparing to earlier models of ECCO sandals.  There is NO comparison, not sure what has happened to their design team??"
Although it is beautiful the fit is all wrong.  It does not stretch so it's a bit uncomfortable and too big.
These shoes are an absolute disappointments. I am disappointed in BOTH Amazon and New Balance for sending a product this terrible and thinking it would be acceptable.  The shoes appear to be unfinished and have exposed foam at in the area where you insert the laces.  I had to check my order to verify that I hadn't  unknowingly purchased a knock off.  Shame on you Amazon and New Balance!
"I was given an 8/12 by a bride for a wedding. It was way to small. I bought a 9 in hopes it would fit better. Now I have two sets of this terrible shoe!
The foot bed is really small not width or length but height. My toes rubbed the tops of the shoes all night and it was painful.  Other girls had the same problem plus blisters on their heals. Because I had the 9 they were a bit big on the heal so I didn't have that problem. I am normally a size 8! I ordered big because they looked narrow. DO NOT GET THIS SHOE!"
I like them. They are comfortable but the pattern is different from each leg. The pattern doesn't line up like shown on the picture.
"Nice looking, but used for two weeks and it broke, just not sturdy"
"Returned it. Even though I am a small, I ordered a size large, and it's still so small I can't get my arms into it"
"It's pretty but the back came off and wouldn't stick back on and that's just not good.  I had to return it which was no hassle.

If you just want it as a conversation piece it's perfect for that.  And if you don't mind supergluing the back so it won't be replaceable battery anymore...then it's a good value.  Unfortunately i needed a pendant watch to tell time."
"I ordered this purse to replace another of the same kind, size, which was also an Ann Klein.  This one is made of much cheaper materials and, after 6 months of infrequent use (once every 3 weeks or so for several days each time), it has started to peel.  The Cognac color appears to be literally PAINTED on!  The purse I replaced with this one lasted for at least 3 years and only began to show wear at that point, having been used on a regular basis.  Very disappointed and no option to return."
Tarnished within one wear. Don't waste your money.
it was a little smaller than expected and quality was shottier than others i have purchased.
These shoes are too big/wide to be a 7 1/2 and too short to be an 8. Very aggravating that Dansko costs what it does but cannot seem to make a shoe true to size
"Nice socks, but EVERY SINGLE SOCK GOT A HOLE ON THE 1ST DAY OF WEARING. I'm not sure how its even possible to make such a consistently subpar product. I'd give 1 star, but the designs are cool...."
"From the picture these looked like quality wool socks with a decent thickness. Socks are very thin, feel thinner than cotton socks. Embroidery is not raised as the picture may look but woven throughout the sock. This may be a misinterpretation on my part but I expected an actual raised embroidery. From the picture the color looks to be a two-tone dark and light grey. Actual color is light grey and dark brown. I wish the other reviewers had provided an actual review to make an informed decision, good if you are looking for a thin brown and grey wool sock."
"These are tight, but their main problem is the soles are made much narrower than the foot bed, leaving the sides of ones' feet hanging over the edges in a very uncomfortable way.  The ""wool blend"" lining is a scratchy synthetic and the actual shearling sheepskin liners of just the very bottom of the slipper are of various unmatching lengths in the 2 slippers adding to their general discomfort.

I bought these trying to get a bargain but they are one of those things few people would buy if you could see them.  They are an unacceptable product, poorly designed, and poorly manufactured in China."
This shoe was cut bigger than the other two and after a while they start to hurt my feet
"I was excited when I ordered this but the wings are terrible.  They aren't as they appear, the feathers are scrunched and wrecked.  I threw it in the trash.  There is no way I could use it for anything."
"Zipper broke in the wash, and of course the ""Return Window"" closed 3 weeks ago. Expected much more for the brand and the price."
The insole is so uncomfortable and hard compare to other Clarks Sandals. The leather is kind of rough and scratchy.
I had to try quite a few hiking boots/shoes before I found a winner. This was the first pair I tried and by far the worst. Very uncomfortable-  did not like them at all. Narrow in the heel and too wide in the toe. You legs almost feel like they might bow inward. Not a fan. I tried several brands and found (while a little pricier) the Aididas brand boots were the right hiker for me.
This shoe runs small and narrow at the toe
I do not like it at all
"I got this for my 3 year old who is 38in and about 38, maybe 40lbs on a good day... The arms were to her elbows and the torso was to her chest, this causing massive ride up -- it just wasn't going to work out.  The legs were fine and the overall look of the costume was, too, but It just didn't fit right.  I had to send it back for a refund and get another turtle costume in a much larger size in hopes of altering it for her before Halloween hits."
"I've had great success with NATO style watch straps, but this one was a complete failure. It is half as thick as my other Zulu straps, and the buckles are made of plastic. It's just shiny, silver painted plastic. I will be returning this one."
I was very disappointed in the pair of earrings I received. One earring had beautiful white diamonds that sparkled. The other earring was completely mismatched. It looked old and worn. The silver was tarnished and the diamonds were yellow in color and dull. It was even slightly bigger than its pair. The stem on the back was also bent.  I was surprised that two very different quality of earrings could have been sent as a matching pair. I had to return them because the differences in the two earrings was very obvious. If both earrings had been like the better one I would have been very happy to keep them as the design is classical and they are a nice large size.
strange underwire in that you can see the midpart through your shirt its like your wearing a CORSET otherwise xomfortablw but strangelooking
Love the color and look but the toe color only lasts about 3 wearings.
"Loved the cotton leggings I wore for 20 years; these are no relation.  Would call these tights without feet, rather than leggings.  They're too thin, look like size 4, label shows Large.  Am a slender size 8.  Was hoping for a loose, thicker cotton -- real leggings -- not tights.  If somewhere knows where to find those ... please share."
This bracelet is cute but it is child's size. It was quite a disappointment to open and realize it was very small. I wish they had different sizes to pick from.
"The design is really nice, however, the shoe is an insult to Nine West in the way it was manufactured. The sides at the bend of the shoe when you walk spreads wide open instead of fitting your foot. So disappointed."
Wasn't what I expected. Thought they would be helpful for my planter fascitis and it made it worse. Going back to my $40 shoes.
"Shoes would fit much better If sent in true size.  With the combination size (9-10), heel does not set and the solar is about an inch or maybe more too long. P
MISSFIT"
If Your 5'2 and under this would be a Mini dress any taller than that it's a shirt and it's not very soft material at all I don't recommend this
Not what I expected. Were too small.
Wore it once and the  Strap is already broken. I won't buy this color again.  No problem with the other color in this same style.
Would barely fit a child.
Don't waste your money bought this item a week ago and it's already torn. Not durable AT ALL! Will be returning
"Was disappointed with this. I wear large for the majority of my clothing, but occasionally need an x-large. I'll remember this next time buying a Levi's non-jean product. This fit fine out of the box, but after washing and drying it once it was a couple inches shorter on my arms, so I gave it away to my younger brother who's a couple inches shorter than me. I'm just glad it wasn't expensive."
"This took several weeks to arrive from China.  When I opened the packing bag I found a thin baggy with no other packaging and no instructions.  Since these took so long to arrive, it took me awhile to figure out what they were.  Unfortunately, I cannot make them work, perhaps instructions would be helpful.  Very disappointing!"
The panda necklace was missing stones and the paint was messed up!
"Initially I was super excited to review this bottle of perfume.  I figured if I didn't like the fragrance, I'd at least have a nice bottle to display in my bathroom.  Well I lost out on both accounts.  The perfume smells like an old lady (musty and dingy) and the bottle is super cheap looking/feeling.  Nothing about this product is worth the $50+ they are charging.  If you're even considering this perfume I suggest you stop into the store and take a wiff of it first!!!!"
This xxl was more like a med
"Ordered a size 14, which in Lee products is usually nice and roomy. These were much too tight, clearly missized. Returned for refund"
"It broke when trying to get it out of the package. I bought one for my daughter and my granddaughter wanted one too. I bought it for her birthday but while she was trying to get it out of the plastic wrap, it broke. It didn't cost enough to hassle with the return."
Super thin and larger clasp so not what I needed
Not well made. Had a cheap feel to it and was badly fitted. I returned it.
"For one thing the size chart is completely and utterly off. I actually had a good 1 1/2 inches or space in the toe compartment. Secondly, these shoes were not worth the wait. It took a good three weeks to get them since the seller is in Korea and returning the item will cost almost as much as the purchase price. Don't even bother with these."
"The samll size thermal shirt is ok, but the pant is too small, and the waist part make me uncomfortable, when I wear it, my attention focus on my waist, dislike it."
"Panache bras usually have very close-set cups, but this one is a more normal. Good if you buy from other brands, but bad if you're close-set and used to this brand."
Poor painting output. Just looks cute in pictures.
Nice Cami but not really what I was hoping for. The fit is way too large to really work as an undergarment.
"These are comfortable to wear and the soles are nicely cushioned, but I find them very unstable. The heels are placed in exactly the wrong spot for my foot, and the shank feels wobbly. I often feel like I'm about to twist an ankle while wearing them. It's ok on the sidewalks, but walking on the grass or on soft soil in a park is not good. I do wear a lot of clogs and ankle-high shoes, so it's not that. Also, these are NOT waterproof. Even dew soaks right in.
Overall, I suppose they would be fine if you are buying to wear them mostly inside (e.g. at work), and/or commutes in the city.

I'm keeping those just because they are easy to slip on and wear while walking the dog, or going to pick up the mail downstairs. Won't buy again though."
"505s are my favorite cut of Levi's.  I have several pairs in darker indigo and one black pair.

The wash on these jeans looks great in the picture. However, when mine came they were greyish and the fabric is thinner than my others. It is like they'd been washed in bleach-- not with the look of being washed over and over. The color looks better after washing them a couple of times, but the fabric is not crisp after washing them--they seem limp."
cheep made.
"Very pretty shoe but it seemed to push my foot and leg inwards or pronate so the pressure was on the ball of the foot.  Just seems to be an odd design to the footbed, at least for me.  Having had a knee replacement, I am extra cautious. Sending this back though it is very pretty - average to slim toe box, certainly not wide."
These are pretty terrible socks
"I am a large woman and I read the reviews and decided to go a size up so, I ordered a 3X and it doesn't even go around me or my breasts. Will definitely be returning if my bestie can't use it. I am a 44DDD"
"Black permanent marker stain on sweater delivered. The other pink sweater was imitation, no drawstring, small hood and very large for large."
"These are passably comfortable but from the very first time my son wore them, the tie came out and there was a rip at the grommets for the tie.  I fished it back through; the 2nd time he wore them it was out again.  It could be something he is doing but we have never had this trouble with other swim shorts or athletic shorts with ties."
Nice color and texture but a hole appeared after a few uses - quality is suspect.
A pinpoint miscolor on front of bag.  Person I gave to didn't think it was big deal but if it was for myself I would have returned it.  Disappointed.
"Looks good, but did not seem to stay in place. All color is coming off belt buckle and I never have it showing since my shirts are all untucked.  It shouldnt be that easy to rub off."
"Bought for a ""Where's Wenda"" costume.  Decided against wearing it.  Cheap, and cheaply made.  Not flattering on my body.  I don't see wearing this at all."
The sandals are garbage they're not worth buying please do not waste your money because they are made of crap and you could probably make your own out of cardboard and bandages
They only lasted 2 months then fell apart at the seems
"Warning!  It pills when you wash it!  The first time that I washed it it pilled all over the place and everything else that was in that load had the pills as well.  Had to wash it again because I was afraid that my daughter would choke on the pilled fabric.  I CAN""T use it and wish that I had never bought this.  Too bad because it is super cute."
"Doesn't,t fit well at all. I had to another sun hat."
"Runs way, way too small"
"Looks nothing like the picture. ""Scoop neck"" comes up really high, looks like a tee with the sleeves cut off. The dress is way too short for a maxi. It barely came down to my calves, I'm 5'2.  Extremely disappointed."
Sz 8 in Indigo is cut smaller than sz 4 purchased at another retailer!
too small and poor quality
"I'm not pleased with this skirt at all. It fits my daughter a full size too big, and the waist is especially huge. There are adjustable tabs inside, but they are located in the back. So once tightened, it makes the back of the skirt look strange. Only the pleats and decorative tabs on the front make it similar to the classic French Toast skirts. Everything is is way off."
"It amazes me that such a lightweight pretty coat can still be so warm, but it is useless to me since the zipper CONSTANTLY gets stuck whether it's trying to zip it up or down."
Whenever I use this sunscreen I get sunburned. One time I had to apply so much I burnt through a whole stick in one day. Certain sunscreen is not for everyone and this one is not for me.
need to purchase 2 sizes larger
"Broke strap when wore first time
Do not buy it's cheap made"
"The bust area offers zero support, and for those of us with little in that area to begin with, it makes your chest look flat and very unflattering. It's also too short for people that are tall (I'm 5'8"" and it rested in that awkward place between your ankle and calf... not sexy) I had to return it..."
"uncomfortable, and difficult to put on.  It also runs really small.  I ordered it because a shoulder injury was making my regular bras hard to put on and take off, but it really didn't work out for me."
"The bag is huge and would hold a lot if it was strong enough to handle it. The seams are poorly stitched and the first time I lifted it, one of the seams ripped. The bag was no where near full. Weight was 39 pounds. I would not recommend it."
Crap bought 3 and all have broken cross got one in mail already broke and the other 2 snapped in half without being worn. Really like the look but it's cheapest made ever
"These really fit funny. All cotton, so the boxer briefs have no elasticity to them you find in other brands that fit better, so the briefs fit the thigh too loosely (and I even got the small!)."
"I was really excited when this came. It's beautiful and exactly what I wanted when I ordered it. However, when I tried to set it, I couldn't turn the dial past a certain point. Plus it was EXTREMELY hard to get the back cover off to replace the battery."
"Maybe I don't know the proper protocol with professional running gear?? I had no idea what I was ordering, apparently. I assumed these would be a thick spandex that you pulled on and went running in like any other workout pants. These are practically a wetsuit. I got the small because....that's my size. I think I would have struggled if I had gotten the LARGE. I was like a fish flapping around on my bed trying to get these on and when I did get them mostly on they did not feel like something I could run in at all. I feel like I wasted a lot of money. I would rather have my ass jiggle in my cheap yoga pants."
"These socks are not one size as listed! I received a pair of humongous size 9-11 socks. Not happy. However, Amazon was willing to refund my order which was helpful."
My son has a very thin narrow foot and yet the strap where it meets the top and between the toe is extremely tight.  Leaves an indent on his feet. The sole seems really cushiony and comfortable - I just hope they stretch.  I just don't know if we'll be able to stretch them since he complains they hurt when they're on.  Totally bummed - they look so cute on him.
"As a Lactation RN, I see LOTS of boobies every day, andI can say that I have NEVER once seen a plus sized woman whose nipples are 3 inches apart as the holes in this bra are.  I know the center panels are available, but THEY ARE NOT FREE as someone else stated.  I just had to order them separate through the website, and even that was confusing because they are not listed as a separate product on their product list.  You have to click the D Lite Hands Free Bra and then scroll down to find the panels at the bottom.  THESE COST ME AN ADDITIONAL $10 and will take more time to ship.  I got this as a gift for my cousin for Christmas and thankfully I got it in enough time to order the center panels and wait for them, but I truly feel sorry for anyone who didn't.  Attempting to use this bra where your nipples aren't properly centered can cause damage to the nipples and improper emptying of the breast, which can lead to a nasty case of mastitis (breast infection). So PLEASE, IF YOU KNOW YOUR NIPPLES ARE NOT 3 INCHES APART, ORDER THE CENTER PANELS RIGHT AWAY AND ORDER EVERYTHING FROM THE SIMPLEWISHES WEBSITE SO THAT YOU DON'T PAY EXTRA SHIPPING LIKE I DID.
The positive thing is that the simplewishes website does have a link to amazon so that you don't re-enter your credit card information."
The outer part of the sneaker actually bulges out it almost looks like a clown shoe. There's no inner sole so it's like walking flat footed.
"Okay underpants. Very surprised after reading all the reviews because these were very ""normal"" looking and normal fitting--did not help my 6 yo with her irritation at wearing underpants like they did for some people. Also the trim came off immediately after the first wash, ripping halfway off the underpants. Disappointing to okay."
Many clothes threadNeedlework missingVery poorVery disappointed
"Well they're good enough pants- decent material, feel comfy, lightweight- but there's clearly some quality control issues at the company. I ordered a black pair first and the light army green pair second in the same size, 36. But the green pants are bigger than the black ones

Update: The green shorts ripped in the crotch area after a few months and the black shorts shrunk in the washer to the point that they looked ridiculous on me. Not happy."
"I was torn between 2 and 3 stars. I sent the shorts back but only because they felt like I was wearing a Kilt. I am 5' 9' tall and weigh 170 pounds.
I generally wear a medium or size 32 waist in most products. I believe I would need to order a 30 inch waist in these to possible have a better fit. Too bad I do not want to chance having to hassle with returning another pair. I learned my lesson about buying pants without trying them on first. They do look great in the picture."
Bought this watch that looks so cool in the picture but I didn't like it it didn't fit right and it had damage all over it the little scratches wearing a big deal but the customer service made it worse and now I want a refund watch out hopefully you have better luck
"The jeans fit as expected and look fine.  But, as they wash the color is changing with a brown or muddy look in the denim."
"this stuff messed up the cork on my birkenstocks , at first they were sticky now they are hard , birkenstocks are known for their comfort and molding to ur foot , this stuff makes the cork hard and it no longer forms to my foot , I made the mistake of believing it and I put it on 4 pair . boy do I regret that ! I will still ware them , I paid $130.00 each so I'm gonna ware them , but hopefully people read this and don't use this product !!! it messes up ur birkenstocks ! do not believe it ! it does nothing but makes them hard - stiff , and they get hot and get sticky now that they have dried weeks ago when I ware a pair aLL day they still get sticky . biggest mistake ever . do not use this !"
Had a very difficult time with these.  Ordered 2 pairs thinking I'd love them like everyone else.  Went to put them in my new Asics and the holes weren't big enough so I had to use pliers and kept cutting the lace to fit.  Then the cord started cutting the top of my ankle where it rubbed.  Didn't have this problem with flat laces.  Wish I could return the second pair now. Will probably take them out of my shoes b/c the rubbing hurts.
"The good:

Quick delivery and the hat looks nice and it's actually is made in Greece.

The bad:

The quality isn't that great.
Examples are that it has a staple instead of being sown together in the back.
Also it has a card board looking (cheap quality) piece that hold the hat in shape. With moisture that won't hold up.

Also ""large size 7 3/8"" is larger than other hats that are 7 3/8"" and so if you can't find a similar hat made by Scala and must buy this look then be careful about sizing."
Case is thin and quality looks poor for the amount of money it cost
"The shoes are lovely, but!  they are too wide (B Medium does not work for my AA feet).  The Clark brand does seem to fit better than others, more support for fallen arches, but I guess I will stick with lower heels.  These days I am built for comfort, not for style."
They don't cover your butt very well. I'm pullin them up all day.
"I don't like to write negative reviews, however I feel others should be warned about the fabric of this dress before purchasing it. It looks nothing like the photo. The title is misleading as there is NO CHIFFON in this dress. There is no actual fabric content label on this dress and the description on line says ""70% polyester"". I have no clue why the other 30% is, but it's not chiffon or cotton or anything soft. It feels like very thick polyester material. It's stiff, itchy and had thick creases from being folded in the package. Kind of afraid to iron it for fear of it melting. I would not recommend purchasing this dress. Poor, cheap quality. I am returning it for a refund immediately, sorry."
Run big but nice
The shorts fit well but sadly the seam ripped in the 1st hour of use. 
Thin sliver .nice but thin .
"If you have a larger bust, this is not for you.. the band under my bust kept slipping up and it was also not very flattering. Buy a more expensive and better maternity bra!"
"It took a long time to send item, then the way it was wrapped,shippped. Though had no damage,I was hoping I would get it somewhat faster...the watch wrist band it's made of plastic...easy to get torn..."
Worst dress ever
Not enough support and shorter than actual size should be. You need to go full size up.
Not a true nursing tank. Doesn't have the built in bra and the latch is very weird. Would not recommend.
"Cheap plastic. One of the lights had come off during shipping and now barely hangs on. Inside the light's case, the battery clip to hold the battery broke. Had to use tape to fix that and then more tape to hold the light assembly onto the helmet.

A cheap product. Unfortunately, the only one of its kinds I could find. Got lots of attention though for my son on Halloween."
This is very attractive. It did keep my ears warm but is scratchy. My forehead itched the whole time I wore it.
I would like the shoe more if it ran true to size.  I wear a 9 usually but need a 9.5 with this brand.
"The packaging these hats came in was terrible, the wrinkles had wrinkles.  They look nothing like their picture, very flimsy.  The quality is minamal at best, but honestly the price speaks for itself....you get exactly what you pay for, a cheap throw away hat.  They come from China...that said, they are very poorly sown together, sewing is a bit lopsided. They are good enough to keep the sun off my head while on vacation for 2 weeks, they will NOT be coming back home with me....hence, the throw away hat!!!!"
"Not great. I bought these for a field trip where I took a group of teens on a hike. All we put in them were water bottles and snacks, and 2 of the 12 had the straps rip before we even got on the bus. The other 10 held up find but we only used them for a day."
"I actually bought these to wear as slippers around the house, as I have had the hardest time finding a sturdy, warm slipper to suit that purpose. Although the suede material is fairly sturdy and the lining seems warm, the boots offer absolutely no foot support. The bottom is just a flat sole. It feels like cardboard. And the shaft of the boot is pretty short and very loose around my ankle (the sides flare out rather than go straight up).

As a boot they are ok if you don't care about or need foot support. But for the price and my purposes, I wanted something more comfortable."
"I don't care if you are out in the sun, in industrial lighting, or sitting under a light bulb-they shine yellow. Very disappointed."
"Pretty in photo...but the ruffle at top of boot would not stay up or straight, just ruined the whole look of the boot. Very disappointed. I was so hoping for a dressy ankle boot."
it came box opened and with cut on the bottom from side to side..
Belt broke quickly. Button fell off.
"Had to Return, the SIZE was NOT True...."
"I am 5'5 wear about 190lbs, I ordered a size large, and it is big, definitely runs big, so I suggest you go a size down from your normal. The material is very soft and definitely good quality. Would order again."
This dress looks nice but it isn't true to size. I wish i could send it back.
"Really comfortable. They're a bit shiny, but overall look good. I'm impressed how comfortable they are.

**UPDATE**

I originally gave these 5 stars, lowered to 2. They are not durable at all, and the ""leather"" fell apart within a month."
"This thing is TINY! If you have a long torso, or bubble butt, avoid this!"
"This bra was not sized right.  I ordered a 32F because that's what I usually wear and the band wasn't right and the cup wasn't right.  Sending it back. Plus, the fabric was very flimsy and not good quality."
"My son wears a boys extra-large size in Jockey and Fruit of the Loom, but these run smaller than that.  However, men's small size are a bit too big.  Other than size, the fabric feels very nice and the waistband seems sturdy.  I'm sure they're nice underwear, they just run small."
"Got these for my boyfriend...and he hates them.  Too thin, don't stay up, junk moves all over the place.  They weren't worth returning, so we donated them to Amvets."
Not sure where this was made but couldn't even get the onesie over my gradaughters head and the hat looked like it was made for a doll.
"Firstly, I have always been satisfied with my purchases through AMAZON.
The shoes are good overall although they are not as comfortable as AICS Gel models.
My disappointment is that the shoes contain some minor white dots on the inside rubber/plastic part of both shoes.
The white dots seem to be part of the rubber and it appears they can not be removed.
I did not notice this when I opened the box mainly because the shoes were facing with the outdside of the shoe up.
As they were a present for my son for Chrismas I was satisfied with this brief inspection.
Obviously, I have learned from this.
Is it a major problem? No, more annoying and disappointed then anything elsegiven these were a present.
I would have expected this to be picked up by the supplier before shipping it out."
"It broke after about a week of continuous wear.  Felt thin and cheap.  For the money, it's not so bad, I guess, but be aware that it's not well made."
"I purchased this chain March 2nd, so that's about three months ago. I purchased it for my mom to wear my recently deceased step dad's wedding ring on. She wears it every day. It has tarnished black. It looks absolutely horrible and nothing is fixing it, not even a jeweler. I'm so sad for her. I should have purchased her a more expensive, better quality chain, obviously."
you cant see the smaller numbers
"The pouch is too small.  Also, the back is cut more like women's underwear.  I won't purchase again."
"I received the wrong side, even though the polibag says 36 32, on the pant paper tag clearly you can see it 36 30!!!!"
costume size ran a little small. it fit my toddler.
"Arrived as expected via Amazon Prime. Like the style of the bra because it isn't the usual shapeless compression sports bra, but it runs very small. The hook closure was uncomfortable and felt like something was poking me. The straps are not adjustable, so not sure how long this bra would hold its shape and not stretch out. Had to return it."
Disappointed with the arch support and cushioning.
"This bra although very pretty, runs small. Moreover, it leaves a burning sensation on my skin after I take it off. Perhaps it is bc is tight,  donk know. I didn't want the hussel involves in returning it, thus I kept it"
"Unfortunately, I did not actually wear these tights until 3 months after I purchased them. The sizing is woefully off. I purchased the S/M, and I'm on the low end of the sizing chart. Still, the tights were way too small. I could barely pull them to my waist, and they wouldn't stay comfortably in place.  So now, there's no way to return them."
"They arrived quickly and they fit. And they even look cute, but these are soooooo flimsy. Will prob only last a couple weeks."
These products were terrible. I had to return them under duress.
These did not fit very well and were not at stretchy as you would like. The fabric was really cheap and kind of shiny and the stitching was very scratchy. The worst part was as soon as I put them on they started frying and falling apart. I returned them. Oh and also VERY see through.
They are plenty dark. Problem is that the nut fell off right after I opened the package. I still cant find the plastic washer. If you have somelock tight on hand then definitely get them. Otherwise make it a bundle purchase.
"Cheaply made, string coming undone, awkward fit all around."
Super flimsy and broke after I wore it twice!! Gets caught on most materials and bends easy!!
"These socks were very comfortable at first.

After a short time the heels had holes in them
Very disappointed and bought a pair of 100% cotton with reinforced heals, thorlo unisex thick padded
So far they have shown no signs of a hole forming

"just like the headline said...I've worn wranglers in the past, and you're supposed to wear them long, but I don't wear cowboy boots anymore, and I ordered shorty shorts, so something was lost in communication. Also, these have a serious mom jean vibe."
"THESE ARE THE TINIEST XL SHORTS I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!!! They look cheap and not at all like the photo. I do not recommend unless you are purchasing for a person who wears a size 3, not a size 12."
Could not zip up half way past my calves! I *think* I have normal calves! WAY TOO SMALL!
Shrinks after one wash.
"Updated 2/4/2015

These have lasted less than half as long as an earlier edition, which is no longer available. Even new, they obviously weren't the same quality and never provided the same level of cushion.

I was surprised to see people saying the shoe was narrow/small; my experience was the opposite. The Lexi was very loose in my usual size, and I had to buy these in a narrow.

The insoles have puckered; I am stepping on folds/ridges. They stick to my feet now, and feel hot. Even though I bought two pairs to alternate use and maximize the life of the sandal, they need to be replaced. Unfortunately, I am no longer confident in the Clark's brand and will be looking to replace them with something else."
Terribly fitted suite! Vest is short shirt is huge and ends up looking sloppy not classy.
"Wish this fit as it's very comfortable and flattering. But it's made for someone much taller than me, I guess. Or someone with an extremely long torso. The cups at the top sit about five inches above where my actual breasts sit. Very strange fit."
"If you are short, these Capri leggings are actually going to be like ankle leggings. Just beware if you buy."
"The jacket is waaaay too small for my daughter, but the dress itself is waaaay too big.  Not sure who it is sized for.  The leggings were also baggy, but shorter on her than they appear in the picture.  Will have to return it as it is not wearable.  She is 5'6"" and 120 lbs, so maybe we should have gone with the small, but the jacket and leggings would still have been a problem.

I bought the wig separately and it is cute as can be.  Sorry she doesn't have a costume to go with it."
"This swimsuit was way too small.  I ordered my regular size in swimsuits, and I couldn't pull it up past my chest to get my arms through the straps.  I would have had to order 2 sizes larger.  I think the description should note that you should order one or two sizes up.  I ended up going to a brick and mortar store and purchased one in my reqular size.

The suit looked the same as presented on the website, but if it doesn't fit, appearance is irrelevant."
Yes they did away with some belt loopes awhile ago. Now they decided to make the crotch and buttocks area smaller in the 505 so the pants sit below the waistline. Bring back the old 505. Don't recomend.
It seems that the majority of the reviews for this product didn't have to pay for the product or received a substantial discount. Does anybody else smell fish?
So small. I could barely fit just my cards in this wallet.
You get what you pay for.  A bit flimsy.
"The styling is decent, but the details are lacking. The sleeves are much too long, even taking into account the reach when on the bike. The wrist elastics are too loose, there's too much slack in the arms, especially in the upper underarm area. Expect a lot of flapping excess fabric when descending. Also, the sleeves are too flimsy and do not block out frigid air (~42F) well, as compared to my Rapha jacket.

The neck circumference is too tight, as well (and I'm on the slimmer side). And the zippers are not easy to operate, especially while riding. The back zipper is very finicky.

Overall, this is not a refined product for riding. The price is good, so if you must get a jacket on the cheap get it. But if you want something better save up for a Gore, Assos, or Rapha."
The sizing between the right and left felt way off. Quality is just ok.
"These are very low quality, light weight, creeky plastic that won't last a week of normal use. They look and feel like a toy or something."
I used it a couple times for 2-3 days and the thong already started to stretch and fall apart. My feet are average and I barely wore them. It's almost completely flat now after less than a month
"The solid colors were fine, but the print pairs have almost no stretch to them and thus are not comfortable.  I subsequently bought Elance Supersoft, which was much better."
"I thought this dress was super cute, until I touched it. The material J's really cheap and scratchy. Also there is volume at the waist which just plots out and makes you look ridiculous. Cute dress idea but anyone with curves cannot wear it."
This did not look flattering at all.
The bag was a lot bigger than it look online.
"Its broke into pieces the same day, i was embarrassed due to the fact that this was a Christmas gift!!!!"
It broke in one used! Not recommend
"Very nice, but they tear very easily as you pull them up"
"The reflection is absolutely stunning, with a shallow angle of view. So someone with headlights will see you, no one else will. Fabric looks plain grey from all other angles.

I'm a 2x in std US sizes, women's 20. This does not fit my hips at all, but I can get it zipped at the waist, so theoretically I could wear this... but really I look like I'm an idiot. Definitely size up 1-2 sizes for US customers.

No room for layering and it is suffocatingly unbreathable. Inner lining is like a platic sheet and there are no vents built into this jacket. Any high humidity makes this feel unbearable.

But it is really amazingly reflective. So 2 stars it is!

Ps. Dear manufacturers, big people have money and want to be seen in the dark too. Try increasing your revenue by increasing your stock selections!!!"
"This is my 6th pair and they are the best thing ever for my plantar fasciitis and resultant neuromas. Unfortunately, the ones I ordered from SmartDestination must be seconds as they kill my feet. The hard plastic insert rubs on the outside edges of my feet. I am unable to exchange them as I waited one day too late to use them in my walking shoes."
"Cute, but even an extra large wouldn't fit over my head. Order at least 2 sizes larger than you wear."
My daughter pendant came off the third day. The clasp was very cheap. Now I don't wear mines. Waste of money.
"They worked well until the lights started to disconnect from the gloves and then a few went out. Would not buy again. Also, these are made with a central battery pack at the wrist and wires leading up through the fingers not the stand alone LED's that I've been seeing on some sets of gloves recently/"
Dress doesn't look like picture. I should of known you get what you pay for. Also it is very small. Material is cheap and doesn't give
"Unless you look like an underwear model, they won't look good on you. Fabric is comfortable, but really missed the mark with fit. They are tiny. There is no pouch to speak of either."
Returning. Sizing is ridiculously misleading.
"super thin, no support and fits too large. I would not recommend"
Sucks woukd not fit and took over a month to get here
"Prettier in the picture. The size fits as expected. Very hard, not very comfortable to wear even though they have a low heal. I couldn't WAIT to get them off and will probably never wear them again."
"It was awesome when my son tried it on, when we went to put it on 2 days later the zipper broke completely and he wouldn't stay inflated while out trick or treating. He wasn't upset but I was disappointed."
"The edge of the right cup was already stuck out, so that it is visible even through the thick sweater. So it was nothing more than waste of money."
Expected an assortment of green underwear. I received red and blue. That is very dissapointing to me as my son only likes green. I do not recommend as they did not give a choice as what color you could buy and that leaves you to assume you are going to receive the item color in the picture. I will not buy again. The size fits as expected.
"Nice looking shirt but I had to return it. Ordered it in the size I wear but I couldn't even button it up. The cut was like a ""Western Wear"" or ""Fitted"" style shirt and I couldn't wear it. I ordered five of them in different colors and had to return them all...but Amazon sent me an R/A and a UPS label and all I had to do was pack them up, slap the label on the box & take them to a UPS store without any hassle whatsoever. Wish I could say the same for 4 other shirts I ordered that I didn't realize would be shipped as ""Marketplace"" orders from 3 other locations and I had the same problem with those shirts (cut way too small). I had to return those at the post office and pay the return postage which was over 40.00 for 3 packages. I'm still trying to resolve this and Amazon is helping. In order to post this, I see that a star rating is required. Although the shirts looked fine, I don't feel that it's fair to give it a one star rating, so I'll just give it 2 stars and say ""I don't like it"" even though the shirts seemed well made and looked good. It's the fit that's the problem."
These have to be seconds. I would not have purchased had I known this.
Honesty is the best policy and this bra was nothing like what the model is sporting on the picture. I received the package and once I tried it on it was so small and it is not black. It should say black and brown! Also I had to pay for returning it which was annoying being that the package the send it is a plastic bag that will rip once you open it. I am a 38DDD this is not fitting for big breasts AT ALL!
Umm all I can say is wow. Absolutely the worst latex mess I have ever recieved and the color is even worse! Don't judge me from the picture because trust me I would never ever buy anything that color! If you are a normal pregnant woman that has boobs and a baby bump I highly don't recommend you by this terrible terrible shirt. It's skin tight!!! It's bathing suit material on top of that! Ah I'm just appalled by this ugly thing! My 4 year old niece can wear the shirt even though the length goes to her knees. If you have boobs and a baby bump just save your money and don't buy because it fits awful and its ugly as hell!
Does not fit the gear 2 watch as described :( waste of money
Not for bald men!!! It kept falling off!!!!!!
"When I first received these I loved them, they fit great and I loved the style. I've had many pairs of Teva sandals and they've been great for quality and comfort. I've had them just past a month and part of one sandal is completely coming apart. I've only worn these one the weekends. I tried to contact the seller but it's been 4 days and I haven't received a response back. Don't buy these."
"After about 6 months these shoes are falling apart. They are scuffed and marked up easily, and the material near the top has already worn off. I work in an office and use these shoes to do just that, walk to and from the office. I've never seen shoes from Sketchers fall apart so quickly.
They were comfortable while they lasted, which wasn't long."
"Returned to Amazon. Need a wider size, but it is not available in any finish or color. Must be a very popular shoe."
"They have an elastic band in the middle of the foot that fits so tight that they are uncomfortable to wear, and I purchased the largest size. I have never had a pair of socks that were made that way before. I need to return them."
"I had no idea this bra was unlined (no padding, just a thin layer of fabric) until I received it. The underwires are pretty stiff and the entire bra is very small. The Cleo Maddie band fit snugly (in a good way), but this was way too tight, and getting it on was a struggle. I'm definitely returning this bra considering it did not live up to the Cleo Maddie."
Chintzy chain.
Opening is too small
"I bought this to use as a carry-on for a long flight.  Although it looks big, it didn't carry as much as I thought it would because it has length and height but no width.  Since I had things like my gels/liquids and snacks, it was fairly heavy (hey, a girl's gotta eat!), and that's when I found out the skinny, ropelike straps are uncomfortable and were digging into my shoulders when I wore it as a backpack.  I looked at my husband's $3 clearance backpack from Walmart with envy because it had nice, wide cloth straps... and it had width!  On the plus side, it fits well under the seat on the plane, it is well-made, snazzy looking and has some nice, zippered compartments (including one inside), so you can organize to your heart's delight.  Not sure what I'll do with it yet.  It would probably be fine if all you put in it were lightweight things (gym clothes, etc.), or if you used it like a shoulder bag instead of a backpack.  But don't buy it to carry fruits and veggies from the farmer's market unless you have very well-muscled shoulders."
Product broke right out of the package.
"Always found my size in underwear never changed, so these are way too small. Plus, the material was rough, even after washing. The elastic waist was thin and I'm not expecting it to last. Think I have bought a pack of dusters."
"It's  very pretty. But my finger always turns black when I wear it. (Picture is AFTER I wash the black off, and it STILL shows). You can see the ring has turned yellow and green.  I DO NOT  believe this is real sterling silver.... which is fine, but they shouldn't  lie to their customers"
"Looks nothing like pictured. Face is very messed up, mask is too large for even the largest person, basically droops over your head"
"Sizing is way off.  The large fits like a medium size 10/12. I like the overall style, except the gold buttons."
Poor quality and cut for a child.
Hated these. Not well made
This individual dress is way too see through. However they have others that are great.
Horrible. Fabric is awful and it looks very cheap.
very unhappy with the shoes they are pretty not the size I it states it is .too small want to send back but she already wore so ill have to give to goodwill . ordered size 11 too small and that's her size if I were to order again go up a size or two/
This item is overpriced and the chain is very cheap.  I would not recommend purchasing this item unless the price was below $30.
"florida dude and big reef fan for years says, reed just isn't the same...i cant get my smooshy 1in 1piece cloth strap flip flow any more...all the others are lousy and fall apart or look like pooh quickly...bye bye reef.  these are cheap.  just ordered some teva smoosh for first time and will see...."
It didn't fit right. I hated the structure. It simply wasn't what I expected. I am not satisfied
One had ripped. Then first wash as instructed still shrunk and ripped even more they were very poorly made
Very thin.  You can literally read through them.  Giving them unused to charity.  You get what you pay for fits here.
This product leaves indents on my 6 month olds face when it's on its biggest setting.
Pretty just like the picture but it runs small.  I'M ML I order xl and still small.
"Honestly, I wasn't expecting much for less than $15. However, was dumbfounded that someone would thing to mail an item to a customer that has an obvious tear, poorly secured buttons absolutely no tag.
 That is right the tag was cut out. Which is differently from tag-less.

It looks as though it would fit. I'll be returning it ASAP."
Cheap. They don't look like the picture. Looks like something you would buy from a dollar store....
I bought several pairs and three of them snagged the moment I put them on.  Please note there were no rings on my fingers that could have caused this and I was careful.  I've been wearing hose for 30 years and never did I have such a bad set of hose.  I will not buy these again.  A waste of money.
very thin and cheaply made
Seconds arm is not working.. waiting on the sellers to contact me. Save your money for something better
"Very disappointed,  will be sending it back. Voice is hard to understand,  especially for my elderly mother. The band pinches also."
"We bought the newborn size but after washing, it would seriously only fit a premie unless you wanted to try to stretch it over your newborn's body. The fabric is pretty thin, so I wouldn't even suggest that. We basically kept it just in case my wife went into preterm labor so we'd have some onesies to fit a premie."
"This skirt is a little loose on me, but that is to be expected. What I didn't expect was how much this would look like the skirts the nuns wore when I was in Catholic school. Except maybe the hemline is a bit higher.

I wouldn't wear this skirt to a business function, nor would I wear it out for an evening on the town. I'm not really sure where I would wear it. I guess to write a review, because I'm wearing it right now.

It's just too polyester looking and the A-line is somehow ""off"". That said, it is nice and comfortable and it is lined."
"I was so hoping that this large shoe and boot brush would serve its purpose well, but alas, the bristles come out of it like hair from a long-haired sheepdog. Every time I go to shine my shoes, I have to vacuum up the bristles. The ONLY good thing is that soon the brush will be bare and I will be done with it."
"I have seven other pairs of Keens, all size 9. All fit well, with minimal foot movement. This is a full size larger than all of them and my foot swims in this size ""9."" Go a half to a full size lower than usual, or better, if you can, try them on in person somewhere."
"The dress looks nothing like the photo. The top fits similarly but there isn't any draping as shown in the photograph. The material is thick and comfortable so I will use for around the house, but definitely not in public. I'm 5'4"" and 125 lbs and this dress makes me have the shape of an Oompa Loompa."
Very disappointed in these slacks. They were too small and too short for the size. I returned them.
"love these shoes,  I wish they had in wide width though.  I usually where a 7. got a 7 and they were a little tight . I would go up a 1/2 size."
"When I first received these tights I was very excited by the color and the softness. It's hard to find a good pair of tights that aren't a total budget-killer. However, when I opened the package, I saw a large hole along the seam of the crotch. Quite honestly, I was shocked to discover this based on the other positive customer reviews. I'll be returning these tights for sure. $16 is too much to spend on defective tights."
"Runs super small. 3x is more like a medium. Very thin, no liner, no padding, no nip coverage, just thin nylon material."
Did not receive the product shown on the description. Had to return it.
"I carefully researched the siae to order, both with the size chart and the reviews, before ordering.  I wear a 36C, and many reviewers said they were D or even DD cup wearers, and large or XL fit them, so I ordered a Medium.  This bra might have fit a medium-sized nine-year-old.  Seriously, it is ridiculously small and not at all stretchy.  I couldn't even get it over my shoulders, let alone my chest."
The packaging was poor and the earring backs were bent.  The quality is poor.  For the price I expected something similar to what you would purchase at Claire's of Target for costume jewelry.  This did not meet my expectations at all.  It looks very cheap and the earring backs will not bend back correctly so they don't sit right.  I wasted money on this one.
"it's cheap junk, came all in peaces"
The fit in the hips and thighs was too tight. It does not flow away from the body there at all.
"Love the shirt. I am normally a women's size 4-6 (somewhere between a x-small and small). I had to order a XXX-L in this shirt. You did read that correctly....XXX-L. If you are a women who normally is a medium or larger, there is no size of this shirt that will fit you."
I thought I would love these flip-flops but not so.  They fit fine but they make the bottom of my feet hot and they make a funny noises when I walk. Never had that happened before!  I would not recommend them.
"Amazing fit and quality but after 3 wears, espadrille started to split and fall apart.  I will return and rebuy another (that is how nice they are) but if this happens again I will be done with Eilen Fisher Sandals.  Hopefully this was just a mishap with their quality on one pair!"
"I'm glad the other reviewers seem to love their chains and it IS fabulous the clips open so you don't have to remove all the charms to install BUT mine broke on the second wear.  It didn't snag on anything, I just was putting on the bracelet and it broke.

There's an argument that it was my wrist size but my bracelet was sized with the two finger rule by a Pandora sale's associate so I'm assuming the fit is normal. Just wanted potential buyers to hear another side to the reviews. Hope everyone has better luck than I as I'm now shopping for another safety chain!"
So disappointed in Madden - Used to make a good shoe. Hard to get on foot and I have thin feet and calves. Sole is plastic - really poorly made- returned  :(
These are poor quality and shrink in the wash.
Junk nothing but junk. I will never get another one from invicta. I break up the same day i got it .
Weird fit on the hips
Not worth the price. No adjustments on the back
Returned.  Fit was irregular and didn't and wasn't a flattering shape.
Fit terribly small.  Very unhappy with this purchase.
not good support because the base that support the sole of the foot is too narrow
"When I first saw these I was very excited because they have the cutest design and they were just the right size. I bought a pair for me, the yellow gold, and a pair for my sister, the white gold. They are exactly the same amount of karats, same size, same design and same price. The only difference is that mine are yellow and hers are white. My sister loved her pair and I did as well. Once I had them for a while, I had the habit of opening them by moving it to the side so it looks like a spiral. She opened hers by pulling it out to resemble an oval shape and then bent it back into place to close. Both of our earrings broke. These were a great size but they broke very fast. One of my earrings broke in half. My sisters lasted a bit longer, but eventually broke. The thinner part completely came off, where the earlobe rests. She was very sad about it and I was too. I decided to go back to stainless steal even thought they're cheap. At least I know they won't break. My sister has done the same.."
"I ordered the S/M size.  But these run small.  And maybe it's something about the design, but I feel like I should be a trainer at Sea World.  I don't know.  I am not a designer.  But as a regular sized woman, these are not flattering."
"I did not like the fit of these.  They ran small but even when getting a size up, they simply weren't comfortable.  I had to return them.  They are extremely narrow, but also, just uncomfortable.  I like the Triumph ISO 2.0 much better."
"I ordered this blazer hoping it would be like it is in the pictures but it's not. I am a size 4 or small and weigh about 105lbs. 5'2.5"" tall and I ordered the correct size according to the measurements they provide it but sadly the material is kind of thin and cheap looking and not as thick as it looks in the picture. It fits me well everywhere but the sleeves barely reaches my wrists,  they are not long enough. The closure in the middle leaves a gap so it doesn't closes all the way.  From my experiences with some of these Chinese sellers on here I can tell that they just can't sew well as I have ordered quite a few clothes from them and most of them have been a complete disaster. I wouldn't recommend this as it's not worth the money. It's better to buy something you can see at first so you don't get fooled by these bad sellers and fake pictures. If I would of seen it before purchasing,  I would of have passed. I think that these are knockoffs and not the original as the picture is. Beware!"
Bad quality. The stitching was uneven in places. Ironing was simply impossible in the shoulders. Consistent wrinkles. Material is EXTREMELY prone to wrinkling. I cannot recommend this product.
VERY HIGH ARCH.  RUBS
"I ordered these once before and loved them. The fabric was thin, did not ride up or shrink But when I ordered this time from the same seller, the fabric was totally different. They do fit, but the fabric is heavy and bulky. Will not buy again.."
Daughter received them as a Christmas present and a month and a half later the whole bottom of the boot is coming off both boots!! And can't return because it's over 30 days!!
Color is much lighter than picture shows
"My fault, too big"
It's not cotton or polyester it's spandex can't wear to anywhere decent but inside my home . Lovely print but not worth it
"Well, I waited a couple of weeks in order to give a more accurate review.  Let me first say that I have always been a big fan of New Balance shoes.  Is just about the only brand along with the Asics that I prefer.  Having said this, I have to rethink about New Balance and what is happening with their shoes.  I have been extremely disappointed with the last two pairs (not even the same style) that I have purchased.  I have always spoke highly and recommended New Balance shoes.  After this pair I will not be so quick to make this recommendation. The shoe runs wide (I did not purchase the wide variety either), has not heel support although it claims to do so.  I have a more narrow foot and I run 3.5 miles 4 to 5 times per week.  This shoe although it claims its for running has absolutely no foot support.  It runs wide and that in itself is another problem for me when running, I like a snug supportive fit.  If I would have kept the box I would have requested a return on it.  But thinking that it would be like my other NB shoes, I pitched the box before making sure they fit correctly.  This shoe was definitely not for me.  I hope that my review helps some other runner make a better choice. I am disappointed to say the least in NB and this shoe."
Had to send it back.  Just didn't look right on me at all.
"I've owned many pairs of Clarks sandals and was looking forward to enjoying these for years to come.  Navy blue is hard to find, so I was happy to order these.  When they arrived, I noticed that the part that your toes go through rubbed my foot, and I thought it always would.  More importantly, the sole of this shoe is very light, and the material used to line the foot bed is not up to the usual quality or durability of other Clarks products.  Maybe some buyers will like the lighter shoe, but I find the heavier shoe to be more comfortable for standing for long periods and for good amounts of walking.  Wish I could make a better report of these shoes, but I returned them for the above reasons."
I returned the undersized Brooks shoes a week ago (paying for return postage) and am waiting for a refund! Great looking shoes  but atleast one size small compared to Brooks I've bought in the past !
GAVE THEM TO A FRIEND TO SEE WHAT HE THINKS.
Okay - im about 150 and I had to order and xl- anyways it's not like how it looks on this little china doll- and the material is like the worse ever! Just think of something that you buy then put it in the dryer where it shrinks and gets lint stuck all over it! Hope this helps
"This doesn't have wires, but it has two plastic pieces along the sides of the cups that poke me in the ribs! Not my favorite nursing bra."
"I bought this belt for my husband. He didn't really like it because it does not look fantastic in real life,and was not wide enough, Though it is a leather belt alright, the size was smaller than expected and I was almost tempted to return it."
"Is very thin & see through, meaning you'll want a nicely padded sports bra underneath."
"Very disappointed. They look and feel cheap. This is truly a case of getting what you pay for. The shoes  run about a half of a size small. Save your money on these, and spring for a better quality shoe."
It's only for sleeping not good as the image looks not good for me as we can't take the ban out with it
I ordered a size 14 thinking it would be comfy if not a tiny bit baggy but it was super tight. Will be returning. Material seemed nice though.
"Updated Review:  this WAS my favorite shirt. It's soft and the design is high quality. But I came to find that even though I wash all my shirts on cold, gentle cycle and hang dry- this shirt and only this shirt, still managed to shrink. It's so short it looks ridiculous. I had to retire it to the pajama drawer and I've only had it a couple months. Super bummed about it."
"The material was way too heavy and hot on these and the waist way too large.  I have not had much luck in Kut from the Cloth, not for the wide hipped, smaller waist body shapes. I had no issues returning for a full refund, though."
Very Disappointed. Is Supposed To Be Fleece As StateD But It Is A Light Weight See Thru Polyester.
"I love Saucony athletic shoes. I have 6 pairs. The fit is great and they have a comfortble toebox. But the color on the berry/viscoral is off. They look like coral and the photo shows a pretty coral color as well as in the name of this color. But when I received them, they are deep RED! I buy multiple Sauconies for difference in color and outfit coordination, so color accuracy is important to me. These are advertised as a coral color but the only thing orangey or coral on them are the neon coral laces and the very bottom of the outer soles. I have berry Sauconys, and these don't look berry either, as the color name implies. If you want to know what the color is really like, look at the Saucony shoe box. That brick-red color on the outside of all their Saucony shoe boxes is real close to exactly what the shade of red is on these shoes."
Arrived damaged!
Do not like anything about the quality of these shoes they have a nice looking but that is all would not buy again .
It came to small but I didn't want to send back.  It was full coverage which I was wanting.  I had my mom sew a white piece of material in back to fit properly and I wore it as a Halloween mail order bride costume so I could get away with putting a sticker over the white material.  I would order 2 sizes bigger.  I order a Medium being a 34D and should have ordered XL.
"Looks great and has good quality materials.  Aside from that .... ugh.
The length is small.  The person I bought this for has a standard sized wrist (standard watch band) and this was small.  To add insult to injury, when it was dampened in a rain shower, as it dried it tightened and shrunk further.  Had to cut it off.
Cannot recommend."
"I got a medium and the bottoms are way too tight... They fit like an extra small. But the top fits like a medium so it's hard to choose a size. I gave the bottoms away and was going to wear the top with different bottoms but one of my straps broke the first day I tried to wear it and I hate strapless bathing suits so I won't wear it without the straps. The bathing suit was super cheap quality and even though it's inexpensive, it's a waste of money."
Didn't like to cheap made.
Looks. Cimfotable but very stiff
I had these shoe less than a month and just over 50miles when I noticed a hole forming on the ball of the foot. I thought I was getting a decent product at a great price. I loved how they fit and ran but I got what I paid for in these shoe. My recommendation is spend the money for good shoe. Dont go cheap.
Please refund
"These shoes were great for slipping on and dashing out of the house, and they're totally cute. However, the life of these shoes is very brief. After a month, there was virtually no sole left, and the cloth ripped at the toes at around the same time. Great shoes for a limited time; I got maybe five dollars of use out of them before I had to throw them out."
I use L size but this have the sleeves short than i usually use and if you want return it you have to pay $1.50 stocking and the shipping charges.
"Do not buy this!!!  The material is so thin & cheap it ripped the first day! The bottoms were also really tight & one of the straps just came off. It didn't rip, it's like it wasn't even sown in all the way. Very poorly made overall.  The crotch was also made weird, very tight, I hate the whole thing & mad I wasted money on it."
"For the price you'd think it would have a mineral crystal (as the description says).  It does not.

The display has a sickly greenish tint.  I don't know why they couldn't have used a clean white display like some of the Expedition ones."
"I love the poncho however, it is small. I have an XL which is actually a medium. They run very small! I am able to wear, but it does not have the comfort I was expecting. FYI..NOT FAUX FUR AT ALL!!!!"
WILL....for the price these were not bad .......the really pretty ones {flowers} broke as soon as i got them and tryed to put them on THIS seller told me to take a picture of the broken ones so they could make them better no refund ext
Fast shipping It broke the same day so disappointed.
"Great product, but after only having worn it in the city, a few times, it is already stained beyond repair."
"It was broken when arrived I had to supper glue it, it should be sent by FedEx do they could've be deliverd to my door instead been Put mailbox."
"My son is fairly tall for his age but I ordered him the same size as clothes he wears, but it was still extremely small. I would recommend anyone to order at least a size up."
"I like the color, but the fabric is cheap, the seams seemed to be off - they are in the front as opposed to the sides of the pant legs, and the around the waste is just a cheap piece of rope that belongs in the trash."
"Beautifully made, but an adult small fits like a child's size."
A little bigger than expected. Somewhat see through. Probably won't wear these much. Just not what I was looking for.
"Very thin, light, stiff. Runs 1/2 size small. Sounds like you have hard plastic on your feet when walking. The sides of the boot cave in immediately and dig into the sides of your ankle. Cute look but very uncomfortable to wear."
Weirdly cut.  The sleeves have enough fabric for two shirts.  They can be rolled up but then they get bulky and fit even more strangely.  Purchase with caution.
My daughter want happy with how it looked. Not happy with material. Looks beautiful in picture but not what it looks like.
No quality in construction what so ever.  Invest in a good captains hat.  It is well worth the money.  Avoid this one.
They may have been okay except I took them to Goodwill because they slid right down to my ankles.  If this happened in public then there would be the hassle of all the women chasing me.    So I gave them away.  They run way too large.  Oh well.
"When I ordered these, it was too HOT here to wear them. I tried them on,liked the color (blue),
fabric soft and comfy. Well long story-short--It was a cool morning 1st time I wore them outdoor
for approx 30-45 mins. Immediately took them off  when in house, only too find I had extreme-blue lower legs.
Working in the health profession, my first thought was, my legs should NOT be dark blue,I'm still alive & breathing.. Once I was out of
panic mode, I realized the extreme blue on my legs was DYE from the pants & not easy to wash/scrub off.
washed them on casual cycle only to have blue dye on the washer drum !:so bad they went in the trash. .and will NOT attempt A.B.
again. even tho I do (did) like A.B.. I'm out my money & pants. OH well !!"
"I got these shoes for a very formal work event, they were SO cute I loved them to pieces, however, the heel of one shoe literally fell off about an hour into the evening.  I tried to contact the seller but never received a response...pretty crummy...they are so cute but apparently you shouldn't expect to walk in them at all"
I'm a small and this dress runs big on the top portion
Junk don't buy - Both gloves coming unsewn
"A BIT LARGE TO BE A SMALL. LONG ENOUGH. AFTER FIRST WASH, IT WILL SHRINK. I HAD TO GIVE IT TO A TEENAGER."
Apparently a 2XL is different for all.  I couldn't get it on.
all I got was girl socks.  none of them were or a boy.  all bunnys and ladybugs.  they showed brown on the picture what I was hoping I would get
I saw this was a pretty cheap tie clip and you get what you pay for. I received the item and immediately returned it because it arrived scratched and not new.
"Almost no support for the instep. Very thin sole and the fit is too small. The material does stretch and I will try and wear them out but I have other, better shoes."
"If you choose to buy this shirt, I want to first state that if you are on the upper end of the measurement chart, buy the next size up. I have an athletic build and I have a size 44 chest. By that measurement I bought the large as written in the sizing chart. It's super tight (it feels like a size smaller) and I'm afraid that it won't fit anymore after I wash it. I think most of my problems stem from this sizing issue.

Unlike the pictures, the stitching is on the outside of the shirt. By that I mean that the flaps are waving in the wind on the outside of the shirt. The pictures don't show that (and I'll upload a photo of this to show you). I wouldn't actually mind this as it kind of looks cool, but on the shoulders it comes to a point which almost always sticks up making my shoulders look boxy and the shirt look small.

The shirt always rides up. This could be because of the sizing issue, but it should have fit because I did order the proper size. You will constantly be pulling this shirt down unless you get a bigger size.

The material is super thin so don't expect it to keep you warm in a cool wind. If you buy the white shirt just know that you will see your skin or anything else you have underneath (like my tattoos). The white shirt hides nothing.

In retrospect I may have been happier with a bigger size. I know for a fact I would be happier with a different shirt altogether."
"Would of been no stars but shipping was on time. Bag design was so scary looking didn't look like skulls looks like clowns! In picture bag looks huge for woman which I loved, but bag is small in size could fit daughters 1inch binder in it. And the worst part is the smell, can't even describe the stickiness! Wasn't worth returning and paying return fees so I just threw it away!"
"I had to return these.  I got the right size for me, it didn't run large like some reviewers said, it just was kind of stiff and not comfortable.  I was hoping for comfort as soon as I put them on.  Probably if I had stuck with them and broken the leather in, they would have been fine, but at this price, I didn't want to risk that not working out, so I sent them back."
"Fits great and extremely comfortable, I've ordered 2 pairs now....the only problem is the seam in the butt starts the seperate. Both pairs did the same thing. I really loved these pants too because the material is soft and looks great on but didn't last long at all. By the second washing there was rip in the butt."
Not very good quality ; after wearing them for a month ; the size got bigger and wore out really fast; I will go back to buying wolverine shoes wearing  it for a year and still going strong.
"My initial impression of this shoe was that it was an over-priced, cheap shoe.  I confirmed my suspicions about the price when I went to a local Nike outlet, only to find it 30.00 cheaper.  Moreover, the sole wasn't cut in the same way of the original, i.e., in blocks intended to push apart to provide a natural shock impact.  Too narrow inside and out.  The sole outsole was wider in the original.  Maybe just buying the name here."
"COMPLETELY See through and it smells AWFUL! It is also too long for someone 5'4"", it is only about 4 inches form the floor and it is huge. Just standing with the material draped downward I can the the complete outline of my child's body. What a disappointment!!!"
Top does not fit right
Hood is not deep enough to cover head adequately.  Costs too more to return so I donated it.
"I had heard good things about Clarks but was thoroughly disappointed with these boots. They are very light weight which can be a good thing or bad thing to some people. For this part it is an arbitrary personal opinion but i was looking for a more durable heavier boot. One thing that is NOT arbitrary is the cheapness and lack of quality with which these were made. Although the shoes look good out of the box, there is obvious FRAYING on the stiching and tons of rubber junk fraying between where the sole of the shoe was attached to the rest. This shoe would NOT last long outside under any durable use. Obviously i wasn't planning on hiking trails or anything but i was planning to use them outside often for concrete/city walking and these shoes have the durability of slippers for bedtime. I returned these immediately and am hoping to find a more durable rugged boot."
"Returned these immediately. Shame on Pediped for making their new line of girl sneakers huge clogs. I always bought Pedipeds for my kids, and was looking for a bigger pair of sneakers for my daughter. Instead of a nice thin flexible sole we're used to from Pediped, these have thick solid wide sole that you see on cheap kid sneakers that are terrible for little feet. What happened??? Yes, they are still light and machine washable, but my daughter would be tripping over her own feet in these. I tracked down a pair of her last year's Pediped sneakers (Leo sneaker), and paid quite a bit more for them, just to get the ""old"" Pediped quality. Off to find a new brand of kid shoes..."
"Cheap, cheap, cheap! Don't waste your money! The bracelet broke in 10 mins! The closing mechanism just broke. Unusable.
The necklace looks as cheap as it gets.
The watch... don't even get me started.
Stay away. Cheap junk. For $25 this should have been WAAAY nicer!"
Not a nice fabric. Very cheap and quite a small cut
Not what I expected. I'm looking to replace these soon with something that gives a better fit and more comfort.
"Let me start by saying that this item is REALLY BEAUTIFUL! It is very sheer & lacy & the color is gorgeous!  It looks just like the photo.
That's the only nice thing I can say about this, tho.

I WANT TO SAY THAT IF YOU ARE AS SKINNY AS THESE MODELS IN THE PHOTOS, YOU WOULD NOT BE BUYING SHAPE WEAR!!  IF I LOOKED LIKE THIS MODEL, I WOULD NOT BE LOOKING AT THIS ITEM! I AM A REAL WOMAN WITH REAL CURVES. Maybe a little too real.

I got the LARGEST SIZE available, but when I put this on, it ends up making MY ROLLS even MORE PROMINENT! The cup portion doesn't come close to covering my bra. It ends up looking like two strips of lace going down my breast.

I am going to keep this item, tho. It truly IS beautiful! I'm hoping that I will be able to wear it soon. Or give it to my daughter."
For $20 these are pretty poor quality. I have to constantly adjust the length because it loosens just from walking. Not to mention the clips are starting to slip off occasionally. I work in corrections. I have a lot of gear and it is a pain to take everything off just to reclip these shirt stays.
"They are made well, but I should have believed the reviews before I bought them. They are  small and narrow. I did order a half a size bigger, but should have ordered one and half size bigger. After all, these are slippers. Well, two, three weeks of wearing them should make them fit better. Glad I didn't throw away my other minnetonka's. The old ones were just the right and correct size for me. Giving 3 stars because manufacturer should state the size correctly.

After a few years of wearing them as slippers at home the rubber bottom started to peel off. Downgrading it to 2 stars. Just wish they would bring back the quality they had when I got the moose skin ones. I still have and wear them after 8 years."
"The style is nice & size was little bit big,the leather is different between each other."
"In the photo the material looks way thicker, and the one that I got is extremely thin. It's really huge on me and I'm a general Small. So i'm basically disappointed."
"When I first received this shirt, I was disappointed in the feeling of the fabric. It felt very light and cheaply made. Then I put it on (albeit at first, upside down) and the feeling was confirmed. It was also very itchy and is easier to wear as a cowl neck, rather than off the shoulder. I would not purchase this again nor recommend it as it will likely end up sitting in the back of my closet until my next Goodwill overhaul."
Stretch is amazing but the fabric is a bit too scratchy and sees through for my taste.
Scale is much smaller than advertised. Not stretchy. Would not recommend.
"My husband loved these. They look nice & were comfortable for boating, etc. But apparently our 60 lb dog stepped on the back of the flip flip while he was wearing them and the sandal ripped in 1/2. Pretty disappointing. Now he's stuck wearing $7 flip flops from CVS until I can find him a new pair. Thanks, Reef."
"really crazy sizes.  I wanted 38"" waist and I ordered the size  4x-38.  It was more like a 4x...it was huge and weighed a ton.  Unless you can try on a few sizes, I would not buy these."
Don't like the cut.
After one washing they have shrunk to where I can no longer wear them. Some jeans are like that. This is an old style jean that sits very high above the waist. Just not what I personally like.
"I bought the black flower vinyl leather printed sz 10 they are so uncomfortable to walk in as far the insole area, the instep area was so painful i had to buy a pair of flip flops to rescue my feet from these torture devices!"
"The reviews made these seem amazing. I thought that they actually looked quite cheap. They were also uncomfortable and slippery. As in, I nearly slipped walking across my kitchen. Not worth it."
did not like these at all.
These run about 2 sizes too large and they are very ugly.
These shoes are WAY too long. I ordered a half size down from my usual size and they were still too large.
it is not working
I can not get my money back and they want me to jump through hoops.  dress falling apart!!!!! Not worth the money.  I will try to get it fixed.  I will not order from them again.  Worst dress that I have ever bought!!!!!!!
I RETURNED THIS IT WAS A MISTAKEN  ORDER.
"The green they advertise in the picture is a seafoam green. However, when I received mine, it turned out to be just plain dark green. Im very disappointed, if I would have known that, I would have never bought the dress."
Too Small. Not true to size. Very Disappointed!
"Loving the Vatican jewelry collection and after reading all the wonderful reviews, I ordered them.  However, the part of the lever back that gets inserted in the hole of the ear, is very wide and it almost reminded me of the earrings that is marketed through India, since the women's ears are pierced with a wide needle.  It is a pity but had to return them, cause I could not even put them on, let alone wearing them."
Mask was cracked. Shirt fit well.
Sending it back. Very thin and small. Not what we expected at all.
"Not Keds by any means.  Cheaply made, smelled strange and looked bad.  The plastic was welded sloppily to the canvas, the width was way off from a true Ked brand shoe, the soles looked sloppy as well.  I don't recommend these, even though I wanted them for an art project I don't think they would make good shoes to wear at all and I sent them back.  Couldn't get rid of them fast enough."
The material is really cheap as well as the elastic. For the price I could have purchased  something with more support at Target.
"Material was thin. Was not expecting a blanket scarf but did expect thicker, warmer material. Color was a darker charcoal instead of a grey."
"Too small for me.  Good quality though, and nice strap length for wearing crossbody."
Material makes this top fit very small -get two sizes larger.
The mittens are fine but the hat is too small.
"The only problem with those shoes is that the band on the fingers are too tight and you get uncomfortable in a matter of minutes walking.

Other than that, the shoe would be perfect. But they really need to lose way more this band so the fingers don't suffer."
Don't fit
"I was looking for a boxer/brief with a package pouch, I bought 1 SAXX to find out it does not hold, cradle, lift or separate like what i was looking for.  I am really not sure what SAXX does."
"I found this product to fit nicely and the material was pretty decent but the waistband smells like motor oil which was a shocker for me I've used Cuddl Duds for years.  I tried washing them, spraying them with X&O which is used for strong odors didn't help and washing it again still smells bad.  I think it is the elastic used in the waistband that is causing the odor.  I didn't return them because I thought I could wash the smell out but so far no luck."
Too small.  Didn't stay on
"Broke on the first day of wearing it. Looked cute, just cheap."
"As another reviewer said, this doublet does not compare with my triplet 10x.
The area of focus is very small, only in the center...the rest is blurry.
The triplet has focus throughout the viewing area.
Would not buy again.
If you want good viewing, through the full area, buy a TRIPLET, not a doublet."
"I have these exact same shoes in the same size (8), and the two pairs could not fit more differently. The material even feels different. My old pair, which I love, fit perfectly and are very soft. (I bought them at Big 5 Sporting Goods.) The new pair is almost an inch shorter and are made of much a harder material, almost a hard plastic. They both say China on the bottom. So either Crocs is having trouble with consistency (which I've read from several reviews) OR this new pair is a knockoff. Either way, I'm super bummed because I was really hoping to have a backup of my favorite summer sandals."
"These looked nice and seemed to work perfectly until one day when I was driving home and they literally fell apart on my face.
I figured it was a defective pair, and decided to give them another shot so I ordered another pair.
After 2 months, the exact same thing happened, except this time they snapped while laying on a table.
I was having lunch at a restaurant and the glasses were just laying on a table.  Not in the sun, not after sitting on them, no adverse
conditions like that.  They had been sitting on the table for about 20 minutes and they made a popping noise.  I looked at them
and the frame had cracked in the same spot as the last pair, which of course allowed the lens on that side to fall out.
I am attaching a photo.  I can only assume this is some type of manufacturing defect, however I will not be getting a 3rd pair."
"I was pretty fooled... it looks great on the picture but NO like most of the reviews its not worth the $$ I had to cut here glue there fix here and there. the bodice is plastic cheap plastic like when you where five back in the 70's 80's costume mask material. the only great part was the fabric that hangs, even the underwear is rather small, the tiara or head piece came apart even before I took it out of the package!! Don't buy it if you do not want to fix it, if you do care to cut and paste then you like to throw money away.

I spent to much money making or rather getting it perfect!  :/"
Fits large and very stiff!.
hard and uncomfortable.
"While these guys were super cute and are lined with faux fur in the inside, they are so bulky and don't fit small calves very well. These would fit wider calves and feet. Returning them but at least I was able to buy a pair that fit ten times better from Wild Diva."
"I thought this would be a nice casual wear-to-work dress (with a sweater). The armholes were WAY to big (5'2""). Might be better for a taller person."
"U purchased these boots and I will be very honest to say that these boots are very HEAVY for a child's feet and defective to wear. My daughter ended up hurting her feet by wearing these boots and till this day she is still  still in pain .It looks pretty from the outside but is garbage poor defective quality on the inside.
I will not lie and say it is good boots cause they are NOT.Don't waste your money. .They are poor quality and hardly comfortable. Unlike others I did not get paid to write a a review , and is completely honest ."
"This is not what I expected from the picture and description. They are an ugly pair of glasses, I selected Black in color and the arms are Gold Color, very cheap looking and big, I look like a fly in them, I gave them to my young daughter to have and she doesn't want them either."
Straps were not strong enough to hold weight of my basic needs. Cosmetics wallet gloves scarf kindle . They have started to fray andlook worn. Very disappointed
"I really wanted to 'love' these gloves, considering I have yet to find a decent pair of gloves that keep my hands warm and work great for touch phones. But I only liked them. Here is why:

1) They don't keep my hands warm. It was barely cold out today (39 degrees F) and I figured I would give them a test drive. Was only outside for about 10-15 minutes and I could tell the cold was getting through. Granted, my hands always seem to be colder than most, but I lived with them long enough (my hands) to know when they are getting colder than normal. But still....they were definitely warmer than my North Face Etip Gloves.

2) Touch response was great considering the material and surface area they used. However, they fall short only utilizing the front part of the finger tip, and not the very top of your finger tips. I have an iPhone 6, and I have to do more reaching when using one hand. This made it difficult, but even so, I always tap the screen with the very top, tip of my pointer finger when I don't have gloves on. I don't know why no one is getting this right after a couple years of touch screen gloves being on the market. Grr

3) The sizing. I have large hands and normally wear Large sized gloves. I ordered the large, but they seemed too snug (finger area). So I then ordered an XL and they seemed too large (mostly the palm area). Cant say this will be the same for everyone as everyone will have different shaped hands, but both sizes fit weird for me and there weren't any other size options. Also, I think the XL was oddly large in the palm area mostly due to the material they have stitched across them.

4) Movement. The action on these gloves are stiff in certain areas because of the palm material I just mentioned. Makes for opening and closing your hands feel unnatural.

That being said, I paid $20 with their GRNMON14 30% off deal they had this week, but I don't believe I will keep them, even at that price. They look nice, but they just don't get the job done as much as I would hope. If it was top notch in either the touch utilization or at least kept my hands warmer, I would settle. But being mediocre in both those important areas will force me to continue my search for the perfect touch screen gloves on the market.

A few last notable mentions....I give them points for adding touch material to ALL the fingers, unlike most gloves on the market that just add it to the thumb and pointer finger. Also, the pointer finger is not grey like shown in the pictures. All finger tips are black. And someone mentioned the quality of the stitching coming apart. I can say, I believe this would eventually happen as well.

Hope this helps."
"Not happy with these, see through as hell! Not flattering..."
These are not waterproof. I bought this for my son and the boots do get really wet when he plays in the snow. Very disappointed.
"I liked this ring when I got it but it turned black the 1st time I went swimming in my pool. I contacted them & they responded ""when jewelry hits any kind of material like chlorine or other material in salt sea or pool, it will tarnish, no worry just return for full refund"". Oh well I bought the Sterling Silver Hawaiian Plumeria Flower Adjustable Toe Band Ring instead & love it."
Runs very small and came with a really terrible vinegar smell.
"I wear a 7.5 and I bought a 7.5 but it fits too big.  The shoe makes it look like I bought too big a size. I don't wear the shoe's at all, will probably donate them to charity."
Very thin material. I don't care for the fit on me.
"The top is cute but runs very small, almost two sizes.  Other than size it is really cute. xxxxxxxx  xxxx"
Beautiful top however it didn't fit and one of the buttons fell off for reference I bought an xl but it fits like a medium. They should be more specific in whether the sizes are. Asian or US. I was very disappointed and can't return because it took forever to get to me. Sigh* oh and the colour was peach nor pink as pictured
I don't like how this swimsuit fit for my mom it is very hard to get on her and it's way too low and runs very small
Didn't stay on my daughter's feet...we had to return
"Ariat makes great stuff. Ask any equestrian, particularly English riders, and theyll tell you they make a good, if expensive, boot.

These are (mostly) no exception... Quality, supple leather. Great style and details. Robust construction. Really a near perfect boot.

Except for one huge thing: the sizing. I need the pair of boots by the day of this review so im not going to keep guessing on the sizing and return these for a different size.

I really feel like the dimensions were put together by drunk cobblers. Seriously. Its terrible.

I'm a size 10.5-11. These in size 10wide were horrendously too big. Like amusingly so. So I tried again and re-ordered in 9.5m. They manage to be both slightly too large, and slightly too small in several places. And not quite in the normal just need to be worn in spots. I have owned all manner of boots. I have purchased riding boots from Ariat for many friends. I have never seen anything like the sizing of this boot.

So as others have suggested, order one full size smaller. And the only thing i can think, is that because of the smaller size, you may need to get it wide too. I really cant tell how easily mine are going to break in. Its loose in the heal (more than normal) but tight in the ball and top. And the calves are some of the largest and loosest ive ever seen on a boot. (normal for more suede type tops but this is crazy large, imo.) They manage to be a little too tight to put on too. Maybe this is on purpose because the floppy calf won't keep it on?

I'm going to oil and maybe even warm these up later to try to get a good fit. I've had them for 6 hours so far... Either way, for these prices, they really ought to have the sizing figured out. This is absurd. While im a huge fan of Amazon, this is one item you're better off buying at a boot shop so you can get the size figured out.

And the reason these get 1 from me is because ultimately, not matter how great a boot, if your boot doesnt fit right, and in this case im defining that as within the universally agreed upon standards in the US since Ariat is a US company, its a terribly boot for the consumer."
These socks are really worth a damn. It was after purchasing these and wearing them a couple times that I realized it make sense to pay a little more for decent socks. Most of the pairs in this pack have holes in the toes and I've worn them a handful of times.
Very uncomfortable.  Not well made.
"This item took forever to reach me and when it did, I was unhappy.  It was small and the material was super scratchy.  Would not recommend."
"When I took it out of the box, I could tell how they felt that they are cheaply made and can break easily. After 2 days one of the earpices came off for no reason but I was able to snap it back in place. They should cost the same as Walmart glasses."
These are rediculoulsly tiny
"The color is WAY darker than the picture shows and is very big on me, pros are it's warm"
Fabric was cheap and the lace looked not like I'm the photo. The zipper I'm the back was not even sewed in correctly. Do not buy not worth it.
Runs a little small I am a 14 and ordered a 16 and is still tight.
"I have Chaco water shoes but they are 11 years old and the soles are destroyed. I liked the look of these because the inside pad for your foot is the same pattern as my chaco's, which I find to be very comfortable. I liked the look and color of these and ordered size 6 in the color of Tusk.
When I received them I was at first, very disappointed with the color. The picture here on Amazon looks nothing like the color of the shoes. When I look at this picture, I see a near black color (charcoal) with a red strap. Well, the red strap is there but the actual color of the shoes is light grey. Then I tried one on and it was way too tight. So now I am returning these and have ordered the same shoe in black, size 7. Hope those turn out better."
Proportions are off
Face glass cracked from the inside within a week
Too tight around toes. Franco Sarto normally fits me perfectly.
Thin and flimsy. Very disappointed.
"***8 Month Update*** - After 8 months of wearing these shoes INDOORS ONLY and cleaning/polishing them twice to keep the leather in good condition, the leather has torn away from the sole on one of the shoes.  Incredibly disappointed.  Steve Madden only offers a 30 day window for defects for warranty replacement and so after 8 months, I'm out a pair of expensive shoes I have barely worn.

Second pair of Steve Maddens and I'm not disappointed, great quality for what you pay."
Tight
I got it today and there's messed up ink in some areas
"Very troublesome product. I'm usually a 7.5 B, but this must be a 8 N because it was simultaneously too big and too narrow."
The band which make these uncomfortable
Print not very pleasing. Too much black outline
"If you get these, buy a size larger than normal. But I wouldn't bother. The material is rough and scratchy, don't know where they are getting their cotton."
Gave me a uniboob and looked like an unsupportive sports bra when on basically. Returned.
I returned it because it was so not a 2x. It seemed to be made pretty well but I never even washed it so I cannot speak to that. It would definitely fit someone according to the sizing chart but it is not a 2x. The sizing chart says a 2x person has a 33-35 in waist. Get real!
"Not very flattering, but seeming good quality."
Flimsy and tight.
"Leather was not completely colored, and pieces were already flaking off.  Expand-ability was minimal."
"The wig is very shiny and thin.  I ran my hands through it after i got it out of the bag and it lost a lot of the fibers.  I probably won't end up using the wig, not really worth the hassle of sending it back though.  Wouldn't be terrible for a Halloween or a one use costume but I wouldn't recommend for any extended use."
Fits very awkward. The top is way larger than the bottom half. I wish I had never gotten this item
"I ordered small, but I received Large! Dont they double check the order details first?! So disappointing!"
"too small, and too short in the legs, and I'm only 5'4""!"
This shirt is not silk its hot feel more wool
"Bought this for a holiday party for my dress. It is as the color pictures, so I was really excited. However, once I opened it I did not like it. I ended not wearing it, because of how it felt. It was itchy and the feathers fell out. Would not buy again"
Prongs are very sharp. Not suitable for daily wear.
Crappy tights material that would snag immediately. Ran wayyy too small. Save your $$$
This wig barely has hair to cover your hair and it's not long like the picture shows. The bangs aren't there
Item did not fit
"I am giving this item one star because I wrote company stating that the boot sneakers came with white laces and the are advertised to come with congac color laces. I haven't heard anything from them. This faults advertisement. Other than that issue I love the boots. They are very comfortable, you can wear them all day and everyone else wants to knbow where I got them and I tell them my issue"
"Sadly, the toe box on these shoes was too short, height-wise. I seem to have this problem on a lot of shoes, so who knows... maybe I have funnily-sized big toes or something. Everything else seemed to fit, so going up a size probably would've been too big. Oh well, the search for comfortable, non-granny shoes continues...."
"The material does not look like the picture, it is very thin material, so if your breasts are not shaped the way it is designed you will not like this bra!"
Cheap. Hood rat status. Buy your wife something nice.
The sizes are small ladies sizes not womens
this was pretty but it was a bit small in the boob area and the sequins kept scratching me.
These felt cheap and small.  I ended up returning them.  I just could not see these lasting for all the miles I run every day.
Had to return due to chain came and had a knot which I could not get out
Lasted a month before rings pulled out of belt.
Designed poorly and fit runs very small.
"Same pants in white and l. Blue fit fine after cut your own button hole on all them. Brown pair is not able button and same size, style, name as other pairs"
"So I'm a big fan of wool socks the year 'round. About a year ago I purchased People Socks wool socks for boots. Those socks came to just below the knee and are awesome. As a result I purchased these ""crew"" socks which I am less enthusiastic about.

Like the boot socks I mentioned previously these seem to be well made.  I am a size 10 shoe and purchased the Large version of this sock which is stated to fit sizes 9-11. The design is flawed in my opinion. This sock rides higher (about 2"" higher) than a traditional crew sock. As a result the top of the elastic area seems to go as far as the widest part of my calf - as a result the socks slide down and gather around my ankles. If they were a little shorter it is my belief they would stay up, essentially clinging to my upper ankle and lower calf area like a truer crew fit. My wigwam, smart wool and REI wools socks seem to have a similar fit to each other.

I am disappointed in these socks."
Nice material but not sexy
"The  Dickies pants fit good, the only mishap was I received 2 pr of Haggar Pants size 38W x 30L in Black."
"#1 problem was that this product came to me smelling like the most vile, offensive body odor I've ever had the displeasure of coming in contact with!  It was SO bad that it made me want to punch it in the throat for offending my nose like that!  But on the other hand, I almost felt bad because it gave me a literal experience of the sweat shop it was produced in back in China.  regardless, I did not feel that I deserved to receive such An assault for my business.
#2: the tail looked more like a braided yarn horse tail than a mouse tail.  I took it off to attempt to replace it with a better one... it was too stupid looking.
#3 The snap on one of the booties was hanging off.
#4 the skirt and diaper cover that goes under the skirt were ridiculous looking and way too big for an infant... it looks more like a sumo wrestler's diaper.
The only cute parts were the hat and the booties, minus the loose snap."
This is quite shapless and would stretch out in an hour after wearing it I tried it on and no I returned it . It's a nice length just above the knee and I like the 3/4 sleeve but just not what I thought
I don't like this at all but the price was low so i will keep it..its stiff and i had to bend it into shape..truly poor workmanship..i don't think it will last long at all..
I returned the shoes because they were too large. I thought about ordering a half size smaller but was concerned that they still wouldn't fit correctly.
Too big and floppy
"These shoes look nice, but they are uncomfortable.  I am not sure what is wrong but I cannot wear them without discomfort."
Awful Quality....
"Great Shoe's, but the laces pulled through the top two eyes after about 6-weeks of riding.  They have a manufacturer's warranty of 1-year, but Five-Ten would not respond to my inquiries on their website.  Very frustrating, since they are great shoes.  At a loss on what to do."
Ok but again cheaply made.
The top is big and the bottom is small. Bottom barely covers my but crack. Brazilian bikini
insatisfecho
Not for me.  Too short.  Thin fabric.  Nope...
VERY POOR MADE
"Flimsy.  Very thin.  More like a shirt than a sweatshirt.  Thought it was a good deal, but it's not."
Very cute shirt but I ordered an XL and it was more of a large. So they definitely run small!!
Too small I need a size 34
This Knee/Thigh High Socks Ripped the first time I put on. I am 125 pounds 5'3 so It wasn't that I am fat. The material is HORRIBLE and CHEAP. Figure they came from China and after I bought this product somehow my Checking account was hacked. So go figure.
"This is the most uncomfortable shoes I have ever worn! If I hadn't worn them twice on the NYC streets, I would return them! The first time I put them on I felt there was something odd about the fit, the padding on the sole was uncomfortable, arch support was non existent, my toes weren't happy, but I thought maybe I just need to wear them a bit and break them in. The second time I wore them, because of the poor construction it causes pain not only on the bottom of the feet but up the legs. It is a cute look, I even got one compliment, but so poorly made."
No don't buy. Terrible quality and so tiny
Sizes do not run normal
returned.  too tight
"Worked great for about five uses, then the mechanism that keeps it open failed. Now it just stays collapsed. Its trash."
The hat is made for children or teens to young adults....not a normal size head. Its so small that it doesn't slouch! Seller has provided horrible customer service.
"it was in My size, but way too small around My chest and in cup size, as if a training bra with cups.  Mesh was irregular/defected.  Never wore, forgot to send back, I think I threw it out.  I got another bra of this style, same brand, and absolutely love it, though.  Random odd error and I should have sent it back."
DIIDNT LIKE
"Not what I expected.  I have one from several years ago, the same size.  Didn't try it on."
My daughter in love with this sweater but it arrive too small.
"I received these earrings and they are not the same color. One is a darker looking pink then the other.  I was looking forward to giving these to my daughter, but now very disappointed..."
"The material is very cheap. Although, I guess I should have expected that for $10. Also, it took forever to receive."
Didn't work for me. Didn't stay cool next to my skin.
"OMG! This suit is horrible!  Really really bad!  Don't waste your money.  The material is some very cheap shiny material and the bottom almost reveals your private parts...in fact if you move the wrong way, it will reveal it.  Please don't waste your money on this suit.  Trust me, you will be disappointed."
"This product is good for dinner jewelry, I have many want to ring said do not fit. It helps me find my smaller rings much faster"
Didn't even come close to fitting
I was buying for compression socks. The quality was significantly worse than the ones you buy at a medical store. Although they are MUCH less expensive. I sent them back because they were basically normal socks.
"i ordered this for my sister for Christmas and it came in a XL not even L when i ordered a M, not too happy cause i won't have time to send it back and get a new one before Christmas comes. I'm not even happy at all. The orders should be right when its a holiday."
much to big for my needs
"good quality, sizing is way off for Americans tough"
Too short for high top Chucks.
"My son wore these for one day and the strap pulled out of the sole of the shoe.  I was able to repair the shoe by popping the strap back in and gluing it, but I don't have high hopes that these shoes will last very long."
"This shirt is fit for a larger, obese mail. A huge oversight is well is the pen pocket only located on the left-hand shoulder of the shirt. I am left-handed, therefore this Panna pocket set up is completely illogical for me. A word of caution to left-handers, this shirt is not set up for you and I advise you to look elsewhere if you are looking to keep pens in the pocket placers"
Darn near unwearble. I enjoy barefoot running in vibram 5 fingers so I figured I'd give these a shot. After a 3 mile ruck today both of my Achilles tendons have some pretty wicked blisters and are rubbed raw. This is not my first time wearing them and I have worn them often around the shop in which they were uncomfortable as well.... they're going to a goodwill this weekend.
"These do not fit as expected however there is no other option on the pull down menu to describe how they fit, i.e., these are horrible for tennis shoes. These socks are very thin, mostly polyester, which makes your feet slide around if you wear them with tennis/walking shoes. If you aren't happy with them, YOU have to pay return shipping! NOT WORTH IT especially when I used my Amazon Prime to receive 2 day free shipping. My loss."
"Thin, cheap-looking. I like the idea of it though. Spend more money and get something nice."
Returned them. Just too small and hit the too of my foot wrong.
Too small and did not look like the picture at all. It was too small in the bust area and way too loose in the stomach area. It made me look pregnant. I returned it.
"My son loves this costume, but the mask was cracked when he opened the package on his birthday today. Unfortunately it was past the return window, otherwise I would have sent it back."
"I was disappointed in the setting of this ring. The one I received was crooked/tilted to the right side. So the oval stone looks tilted and not centered. The stone is dark to the point where it appears black. I ordered the Garnet. The cut of the stone however was perfect with no chips. I ended up keeping this ring because my 'dependable' little sister forgot to drop off the return package to the UPS and it's past due the return period. When you want something done right, you gotta do it yourself!"
shoes came defective with marks and fit was extremely tight. Right foot was too tight.
I never owned one
Product does not fit well for taller people with a longer torso.
"Be careful, there are so many counterfeits of DW watches.  Yes, there are counterfeits of ""inexpensive"" watches too.  I purchased a Dapper St. Mawes from RetroDeals2000 from Amazon Marketplace and received a fake one.  I compared an authentic one purchased directly from Daniel Wellington website and there are obvious differences.  The real one always has engraved wordings on the back case; the fake one has painted on.  The styles of the dates shown inside the watches are different as well; the real one's style is of a taller Times New Roman, while the fake one's is short and bolder.  The fake manual has a blurry picture while the real one's is very clear, crisp and colorful.  There are many other details, but I digress; otherwise, it would take a while to list them all."
I expected it to be cheaply made  but this was really cheap. Some kind of weird shiny polyester fabric and the image was off center
They were awkwardly large on the top of the shoe. Really cute shoes but I had to send them back.
"this is for very petite women.  a lean 5'9"" too too tall for this getup."
"These run small, I had to return this."
"Updated review:  Although I really liked these, both pairs just fell apart after a couple of months.  It wasn't that the screws came out -
but the plastic around the hinges simply disintegrated.  I have many other pairs of readers and none of the other brands have ever come apart like that after just occasional wear."
"Very uncomfortable, cut into my foot at the base of my big toe!  Sad. Because they are nice looking."
I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED IN THIS SWEATSHIRT. It was so little and the hood wasn't even an actual hood.. Was not impressed.
"I ended up giving this jacket to a friend because it was WAAAAAYYYYY too big for my daughter. It looked really weird too, not like the picture"
"The size S/M is more like an XL. Disappointed, but it is comfortable."
This is an okay necklace for the cost.  But the stones are so cheap that they look white.  I will be returning it.  I'd rather save up for a year for a necklace with better quality diamonds.  The chain and horeshoe itself are nice.
Just no.  In person it looks like a frumpy grandma nightie. I hated it. My husband also vetoed it in half a second. I returned it.
"It is too large at the legs
I never buy clothes on Amazone again"
"This is great for maybe a one-time use thing, but believe the other reviewers.  The boots smell over some wear in the day and the costume as a whole is thin and cheap junk.  Fun for an office party, but definitely don't expect to ever compete in any costume contest with this.  The pictures always make these products look great. Definitely I would recommend as a cheap option for an office party or something.  Overall definitely not up to my standards."
"Really like the idea of this suit as it doesn't have the neck tie which always makes my neck hurt from it digging into the back of it. However I don't suggest this suit for bigger breasted women, as there isn't really any support so it makes my cleavage look weird. I don't even use the top because of that, but I wear the bottoms."
"Cost to much to return, was having trouble tring, Gave it to a homeless person I met near a store asking for food.."
"I did not wear or try the belt on when I first received the belt; when I did finally wear the belt on New Year's Eve it was a little short in length but I wore the belt anyway.  When I returned home I couldn't get the belt off at all, I tried for over one hour to get the belt to disengage but it wouldn't so finally I just gave up and decided to cut the belt off in which I did. I tried everything possible to get that belt to disengage so that I could slide it off but it wouldn't work. Very disappointed in this belt and the design of it. Would like to return this belt to you for a refund. Please let me know as soon as possible what I have to do to return it and receive a refund for this belt."
So i bought these steel toe shoes to where at work.  Turns out the only thing steel about them are the toes.  I don't know why anyone would make a shoe that didn't have atleast the top two laces made of steel also.  I just broke them today so i'm a little bitter about it..
I ordered a size bigger than I normally wear and it was way too small.
"I had heard such great things about Merrells.  I bought them with the intention of wearing them on my vacation to California.  I wore them for weeks before leaving.  They have two main problems.  Although they are wide enough, they are not long enough, and my big toes push too far front.  Second, there are painful points in both arches that push into the sides of my feet.  If I could,  I would return them.  They have been a major disappointment, and have nearly ruined my vacation as I haven't been able to hike and walk like I had wanted to."
"The picture looks pretty but in person this piece has no depth, very flat, and looks more like a paper cutout.  I'm returning it."
Odd fit. Returned
Didn't like them.  The entire top is a thin neoprene.  It was barely able to stand up by itself and the fit was snug.  I tuck my hunting pants into my boots when I archery hunt - and that wasn't going to work.  I prefer boots with a stiff rubber upper section and these don't have that.
"Hard soles, I felt the irregularity of the inner sole as very uncomfortable on my feet. I have a hard time believing these shoes were manufactured by ASICS, as the make such great products."
"True to size, but the fabric quality is subpar, and makes for a clumsy fit around the waist and bust area. The color is pretty, though. I returned it today."
"I regret I didn't return this jacket. I bought it about 1 year ago. It isn't soft enough and had a strong smell. I don't think it's made of genuine leather, even if it's a leather - very low quality then. It started to peel off like manmade leather does.  It fits well, but what I hate about it the most  - it makes an awful cracking sound!  At every move, it makes sound so bad, I feel uncomfortable to wear it because of it. I tried every solution I found - conditioning,  nourishing, leather oils and cream, nothing helps. I thought I saved money when I bought this jacket, but actually, I only wasted it."
Returned shoes for a refund; didn't like them enough to  request a smaller size. Seemed like they were men's shoes.
Bottom split open after about 4 months of wearing.  Really nice finding this out when you're at your new job and you step in a puddle on the way into work.
Quite small. Was really disappointed. I haven't used it.
"I was so excited about these because I had read so many reviews citing them as having wide calves, but was disappointed when it didn't come close to zipping up around mine. They are high quality boots and I am sure they hold up well, but I had to return them because I could not zip them. Wide calved people, be warned!"
too small especially in the sleeves
"Looks terrible on me, they are so tiny that it was embarrassing just trying them on. I am a fairly small girl, I wear a size small, dress and jeans size 0-4.... pretty sad about it."
Well I didn't get the same size top and bottom but from the looks of the bottom it doesn't matter what size I get it wouldn't fit any girls body and cover correctly so I didn't reorder. We will wear the top with another set of bottoms we have. I've already thrown them away.
"Ok so I recieved the bra through a friend because I am an international buyer, so those out there be careful of how you order this bra size. It is not too bad of a quality but the size is small. I believed i ordered a 34DDD, i can wear that or a 34G.. not sure which one I ordered. I am fairly full with a small back and I really was looking forward for a strapless bra. However, my fault for not going into a store to get a bra right? sighs.
So the size you order, it will be a cup less for uk size, however mine seem to be 2 cups smaller because they sent me a 34E :("
"There run extremely wide in both the toe and heel.  I love running shoes with a wide toe box, but this shoe is too wide to provide any support.  My foot moves around and my heel lifts right out of the shoe when it's laced up."
"These fit PERFECTLY. Nothing like putting on a good bra!! Only thing that was a deal breaker is the cup inserts. Somewhere I read you could remove them, but this is not possible. If you want to look as though you've come out of the '50's, by all means, this is your bra. Otherwise, it's far too perky for me."
Much too tiny to do anything with.  Pretty but completely impractical.
Thin cotton.... feels and looks cheap...... strap broke immediately when first trying it on... stand in the light just right and you can see through it... waste of money
My daughter cant get her fingers in ...
Need to establish a definition of size.
From China Asian sizing I ordered an extra large and could not put my arm through the sleeve hole watch out beware very very tiny coat
Horrible manufacturing. You can see the glue all over the show and the ribbon was dirty.
"I've tried almost all of the non cotton Jockey underwear.  Some fit correctly...but most don't and are too small.  I've returned more than I keep to the local Jockey store, who will exchange them for others.....  that frequently are too small also !"
I purchased this for my mother for Christmas. It is cute but the stitching came undone after only see few uses. Sadly right after it was to late to return. Run!
"When I went to adjust the side strap, the snap that was through the body of the had came apart.  When you buy a new hat you should not have to repair it before you can wear it for the first time."
"This is the first time I have had a problem with Dockers. The inseam was supposed to be 32'. The label clearly said 32' but they are waaay too long, maybe even 36"" I will have to take them somewhere to get them hemmed. What a pain."
This not one size as it claims.
"This was pretty and delicate. However, 2 stones were missing. It also did not fit my face well."
"I love Cherokee. I love all the pockets but these where way too big on me. I had to return them. Wish they made this style to fit women. I'm 5'3"" 125lb and ordered a small. They where too long and just too big. "
"It kind of ""puffs"" by the sides... :("
"These shoes, although look great, are terrible for any impact sport.  I am a huge fan of Asics, however not this shoe.  There are two major issues with this shoe: the ball of the foot area is so thin, there is virtually no padding for impact, and also the cloth exterior is too flexible that when pivoting and turning, your foot feels as if it will slide out of the shoe.  This shoe is 100% made for casual wear and nothing else, especially not performance wear.  They are breathable and pretty, and that's about all they have going for them."
Item is too small and don't look like picture
"I waited weeks for this s*** only to be disappointed, I am a little curvy but have tried the same size of leggings in the description and it fit me great, this wouldn't even get up my thighs, not very stretchy at all. there should be warnings that it runs extremely small so people who have a little to them like myself know to look elsewhere. I am pissed off I waited all this time seeing all these great reviews.  I should not have to look in plus size when I'm a tiny bit curvy, VERY DISAPPOINTED, and definitely returning this crap"
"The skirt is more of a dark acid wash ""denim"". The fit was great, and the material is soft and comfortable."
"I wanted a comfortable bra because my bras were getting old. I saw all the wonderful reviews so I tried it. I put it on and my ""girls"" didn't fill it out enough where the ""nip"" part was. I ordered a size smaller than usual too. It looked bad under shirts and the lines through the front showed. It was not concealing at all. I like modesty, because I do not like worrying about if my nips are showing. This bra shows points and it is not even mine! If you want modesty and you like feeling comfortable in any shirt, just go back to padded."
I returned them the day after I received them. The toe area was too small but the back was loose so my heel was slipping out. Not a good combination. I didn't even pay attention to any other detail of the show. I knew I wouldn't be able to wear them.
"Really small shoes. I bought the same size my daughter always uses, but they did not fit at all.
I am very disappointed and my daughter too."
"It feels that this was designed for a child. The entire thing is only 12 inches in length, which is barely able to cover from the top of my head to the bottom of my neck.
In the photo it looks like it is about 16 inches since it is able to entire head of the mannequin.

Based on other reviews, it looks like there are a whole bunch of sellers with similar items, and they just bunched it all under this listing."
I'm a woman and these slippers were so masculine and unattractive I sent them back and purchased another pair that was more pleasant to the eye.
what a piece of cheep crap don't buy it
This blouse is very pretty and feels soft on your skin as well. But the sizing is smaller than any other Chinese brand blouse. I usually wear size 8 shirt for H and M shirt and Large fir me perfectly for this one. I am 36 around chest.
These ties are very low quality and I would not recommend at all.
"Size runs very small, and length is also shorter than it seems.fabric is great quality though"
"Bought these in a few different colors and eventually returned them all. Was looking for a vest to wear semi-casually under a sport-coat. These are made of a cheap material that wrinkles easily and it is way too big. Had to buy 2 sizes smaller than normal and then it was too short but finally fit to my body.

Overall, I would not recommend these unless you are on the overweight side and okay with a cheaper material."
not precision enough
Too large for a tween girl. I lost track of time and then it was too late to send them back. Now I'm stuck with them and my 11 yr old daughter cannot wear them because they slide right off her wrist.
"Yikes, unless you're a tiny tiny waif, this isn't going to work out.

I am NOT a tiny waif.

The fabric is GREAT, though. I just literally couldn't get my arms through the armholes!"
Fits very tight instead of a loose fit like advertised. I returns for a refund.
Ridiculously small! I ordered an XL because I'm busty I don't like them tight. This thing is a medium at best!! It's pretty otherwise and the quality seems great but it's only meant for tiny people who think they are larger than they really are.
not what I expected. to thin. was looking For wide belt
Definitely Not one size fits all.  Cheaply made.  No tags at all for size or washing instructions.
This bag is extremely small.  It looks like a bag my 6 year old niece would carry.  I sent it back!!!
"I am so disappointed.  I wear a 5 or 5.5 D, depending on the shoe.  So I ordered 1/2 size up as recommended, a 6M.  The toe fit fine.  But the heel was so loose, that just walking around the house to try them out, I could tell that I would quickly get a blister as my feet slipped up and down in the heel as I walked.  I was also unable to wear heavy hiking sox with the boot, only normal thickness sports socks.  The reason:  I have a high arch and with the heavier hiking socks on, the top of my foot over my instep was being rubbed uncomfortably by the top of the boot.  With normal thickness socks this was not a problem.  So I had to return them.  I am so sad.  I have been looking for a hiking boot made in the USA that was also comfortable.  It is so difficult to find a small size that is also wide.  I will keep looking"
"Great shoe for our rough wearing 8 year old.  He has been through nike's and adidas in 6 weeks.  These have held up much better.  Still look great after over a month of summer wear.

UPDATE!!! - 2 Months after purchase.  Shoe has pretty much fallen apart.  The drawstrings have snapped.  The inside sole has wore through.  and the outside mesh has ripped.  Disappointed in Merrell on these.  I thought these were going to be the ones.

Maybe they could work better for your kiddo."
"Peppery scent, not much lather, too expensive"
Screw in part is way to short. Lost it within a few weeks.
Nice hat but ridiculously huge! And I have a pretty big head. Maybe I got a dud.
"I had a pair before that was identical to this one and those fit fine.  It turns out that these (even though listed as medium) are wide and pretty large, flopping on my feet when I walk.  I do not understand how one can buy a prior pair that fit fine and then get a second pair in the same size and those be too large and too wide!  I paid a lot of money for these, but am dissatisfied with how they fit."
"This shirt fits me well and is tailored well. But, I was expecting the colors to be red, white and blue. But the white is actually off-white kinda beige, which is the color I do not prefer to wear. I am giving a 2 star because the picture of shirt was not true. DO NOT BUY this product if you expect the white to be actually color white and not beige or off-white."
"This is a very cheap made purse (hence price), it is WAY bigger than it looks in the photo also.  I sent it back because it was not what I was looking for."
"This bra has such great reviews I was so excited to order it after reading a million nursing bra reviews on Amazon. I was so disappointed when I received it, because the product description states the fabric content is nylon and spandex, but that is totally incorrect.

Here is the fabric content from the label of the package:

Fiber content (exclusive of trim) 90% nylon 10% spandex
Foam cup insert - lining 100% polyester
Foam 100% polyurethane

Unfortunately, I have extremely sensitive skin, and am allergic to all polyester clothing. It makes my skin itch and burn the minute I put it on. I put the bra on when it arrived to see how it fit, and immediately felt my skin itching. I took it off in surprise, and looked at the package to discover the lining is polyester!  The satin trim around the edges is also polyester I'm guessing, since it was just as irritating to my skin. Sooo disappointed as I will have to keep hunting for the right nursing bra."
"have not received it b/c i have to retrieve it from the post office as it needed a signature at the time of delivery.  never saw that listed anywhere on the description.

if i ever get it i will write a review.  i have other Nixons and they're all spectacular and the price was killer here.

UPDATE July 15:
Changed title of this review to reflect condition upon arrival.  This is the stainless steel/black face Nixon Small Player.

Hand delivered today (order placed July 8) by my favorite mailman. The watch was not set nor working.  The watchband is different than it appears in the picture. The band looks to be a brushed stainless all the way across, but it's brushed stainless with a smooth stainless center strip that doesn't appeal to me.  Now that I have seen the watch in person, it's slightly more detectable in the images, but if it were more obvious, I would not have purchased.  It seems all the colors have the smooth middle strip. As well, the plastic face film was missing, unless Nixon stopped supplying them.  After setting and winding per instructions, the watch is keeping time a just bit slower than actual time.

Other than the band, the face is handsome.  I liked how my wrist looked wearing it.
Sizing was perfect for my tinier than most wrist.  It is thin enough to not jam into either your arm or back of your hand.  It feels solid, has a nice weight to it and with no alterations, it slid around my wrist a few times to where I'd likely remove a link or 2.

Disappointed that it is not a solid stainless steel band, so this is going back.  Otherwise, I might have held onto it.  But flat rate return price of $5 means it's cheaper to return than find a band I like better.

UPDATE:  July 22, 2014
Jomashop is giving me 30 days from the date the item left their warehouse, which is unacceptable.  How can a buyer have a 30 day policy from Amazon and then have much less give the seller does not inform us this is a signature only delivery.  This alone accounted for 3 days.

In addition, the Jomashop Details page lists the return conditions which must be fulfilled to authorize refund of purchase price. In the email reply to my request for a return, the seller indicates that once conditions of return are fulfilled, the buyer can expect a refund for purchase price less that of 10% restocking fee.  It is not only unethical but unacceptable to state one policy online then quote another to the buyer once a return has been requested.

Also, the seller made no mention of the watches missing plastic face film, non running, & slow time keeping condition upon arrival. I have never ever received a watch with no film on the face.  This is indicative of a company which deals in knock off/stolen watches and not authentic products guaranteed by Nixon if sold by an authorized Nixon dealer, which I believe Jomashop claims to be.  If you look closely at their repair policy, you send it to them, NOT to Nixon.  This is not the Nixon authorized dealers policy, it's Jomashops.  Who would you rather work on your watch, Jomashop or Nixon?  A buyer is NOT protected in a purchase of this type when it is unknown how the watch came to be in Jomashops possession. Perhaps they purchase returned or old stock which is then ""refurbished"" and passed off as new.

The minute a seller demonstrates questionable ethics, I start regretting my purchase. I guarantee if I return the item, Jomashop will find fault so as to authorize the witholding of a restock fee.  These misleading methods, i.e a signature upon delivery takes days and it's less time that a buyer has to inspect and return the item, or the restocking fee(????), work in Jomashops favor and not that of the buyer.

Given all the hassle Jomashop makes the return process (hoping to deter you) it is cheaper for me to buy a new watch band than be out a restock and shipping fees. Forgot to mention, the shipping must be signature upon delivery to them, which is a couple more $$.  Just a poor decision in my behalf for not learning more about the retailer, but alas you get what you pay for.  It's probably defective too.

In all honesty, buy the watch if you love it, but not from Jomashop. Wish I had never retrieved it at all."
"too tight, slick and uncomfortable, like wearing a tight plastic tube"
The front was a little too open for me. I wore to a birthday party but I was self conscious about that being too open. Nice quality. I could have used a smaller size than my normal
The watch looks cheap like a trendy designer brand warch. Of course many people like and wear designer brands .
"Returned, cheap and flimsy material"
Cheap made and looks like it. Fits terrible and sides gapped!  They don't look like the picture. We ended up throwing in trash because wasn't worth the cost and time of trying to send back!  Don't buy!
"Shirts are NOT like they say.
I ordered 2 shirts xtra small . One burgundy and the other beige . I got a yellow and red one, not what I asked for at all. They don't even have the cute ruffle on the bottom like the pictures.  I've got shirts from here before I'm very disappointed
Do these shirts look like extra small or the colors I asked for? NO they are not!"
Too cheap looking but it was light weight and comfortable.  Just not what I expected.
I wear size 35 waist which not available so I ordered 36 & it's WAAAAAY too small- more like 32.
"I bought two pair of shorts, 44 waist, and each of them were different sizes, although the labels said 44W. One of the shorts is like a tent, the other I have to cinch up on the belt to the top hole. I am disappointed in these. I guess I would recommend ordering a size smaller than your waist size."
Product arrived with two very noticeable holes in the side.  Returned it.
"orderd green got some s***ty off black crap looks and feels like crap  heat transfer garbage don't waste your  your money.
you can check i never give bad reviews . but when i i seen this crap i was pissed..."
It is cute. Watch worked for about 3minutes. Not worth sending back. Will not make that mistake again.
The chain is fine. The cross has burrs all around.
"Way too small. I'm a size 8/10 and this shapewear was incredibly tight, couldn't even get it over my bottom."
"I purchased this shoe goo to temporarily repair a small tear to the side of my rubber rainboots. It was messy to work with and when I wore the shoes 48 hours after I had applied the shoe goo, the goo almost immediately gave in, and the tear was open again, the only difference was that there was a glob of clear, dried up shoe goo on one side of the tear."
"Actually, this is not a bikini - this is thong pants! Seems like wrong picture and description at the shop page.
But size and color as expected, good textile."
much cuter online than in real life. just too big.
I really wanted to love this shirt. I've been searching for a sheer blouse with fun patterns. I'm usually a US 2XL (16-18); so i ordered the correct size according to the size chart. The shirt wouldn't even make it to my shoulders. I'm very upset. Other than not fitting it's a nice shirt.
Unfortunately this fell days after I bought it and that was the end of it
"this style of shoe runs small, definitely not a standard size 10 shoe."
"Too tight in the legs.  Was looking for something cooler for summer, but the fit just wasn't there and I am in great shape.  Body type I guess."
Surprisingly heavy on the ears.
"On the model these jeans look like they fit with a narrow leg. They look like a slender fit.  However, the legs are very wide!  They looked like baggy elephant trunks on my legs.  Yuck.  I sent them back. (I ordered size 12)."
Cheap and tiny
"I wanted to love these shoes; they're cute & fit right in the length and width, but there is a noticeable and uncomfortable gap under the middle of my foot, giving no support whatsoever. My co-worker asked to try them on because she wanted to buy them from me instead of me having to return them, but she had the same problem. Also, the top strap is adjustable, but was still way too small for my ankle."
"I bought this for my daughter and before she even wore it once the center piece fell out, the item is cheaply made."
"do not buy these they are thin and immediately roll down withing minutes of wearing them. they are not made well, more like pantyhose grade worthless"
"Picture looks great, but looks really cheap, like a toy, in real life.  Really plasticy."
Sizing guide is so confusing. Nice fabric but got pants big enough for two.
"Had to return it, it was way to large specially the length, looked like a baggy maxi dress"
"I was 9.5 months pregnant when I bought this and just now tried it on - I now realized I missed the return window by 5 days, which is my fault.  That being said, I read the reviews and bought a 2X, thinking it might even be a little big, and I can't even get the top around my chest, so it's unwearable. Bummer that the fit is so poor."
"I ordered two pair.  The first on is tight on my feet and the straps will not stay in the front position on either left or right foot.  The second pair the straps work fine.  Same size same color, but still a little tight.  I have other Crocks this size and they fit fine.  I got a size seven pair from Nordstrom's and they fit better than these two size 8 pairs.  Nordstrom did not have size 8 in stock."
"Not so comfortable, Not soft at all. However, it's mesh built allows cooling air flow. I do not use them"
"This style did not work for me, no matter what size.  The shoe was hard and uncomfortable.  I will check another brand that's more comfortable."
"Run a bit small, and the quality doesnt match other Dandko shoes/sandals that I have.  Very dissapointed.  Will have to sell as it will be too costly to return."
"It feels good when you have it on. Fit was good also, however, it is way too bulky. No way you can wear it under clothes as it shows and you look deformed lol also, it makes it really hard to bend over or any bending of you abdomen for that matter. The closure snap is very thick and made or synthetic leather which makes it impossible to do abs or dead lifts, squats or anything at all. I's returning this item."
memory foam made them to tight on my foot
"I love these shoes they were so cute, fit perfectly and were wonderfully comfortable.  But after wearing them one time the outsole came completely off, it just came unglued from the top of the shoe.
Returned them, super disappointed."
"Nooooooo! First pair of Clarks EVER that doesn't fit in my regular size. It's way too narrow. I actually stopped by the house after work to change shoes because it would have been too painful to walk around the grocery store in these. Seriously disappointed because I choose Clarks for the comfort. I really didn't want to throw them away, so a few weeks later I wore them to volunteer at the church for a couple of hours (lots of standing, hardly any walking), and it wasn't so bad. I am hoping they may stretch out a little."
Ripped on first wear.
"I have had great bras from Chantelle in the past, in the same size as this one. However, this one run a lot smaller, and was more flimsy, not the quality expected, nor the fit or size."
"All would have been well if they'd stayed put. Great idea, but the fit wasn't good for me, as they kept coming loose and slipping off. Frustrating to keep fiddling with them during a run. Used with the Pace Glove."
Never again buy they are easy to tear up
It's not really a shamag but more of a woman's scarf. Too small to be used in the traditional way. So thinly woven it's see though. See photo.
This pair of shoes fall off my feet!
The colors are great and it held up well in the was but I ordered 27x27 and got something smaller. No time to contact seller due to travel schedule.
This ring has sharp edges and is not as finely finished as it should be. My daughter caught her hand in the door and the ring crushed on her finger. The ring could not be salvaged. My other celtic band rings are of much higher quality.
"way way way way way way way way way too small. I'm 5'8"", 140lbs, slim figured. I ordered XL and I literally cut my circulation off squeezing into this. After I got it on, omg. I would never. I've bought sooo many Asian items and  the XL is usually equivalent to a US medium but It's so tight.... I hit the seller up for a refund or exchange but that was weeks ago and I've gotten nothing. bought it from cilitop so maybe it's a seller issue.."
"Real poor quality wristband. The ""leather"" band fell apart after only a few times wearing it. If you choose to buy this watch, get a good aftermarket wristband."
"Way too scratchy and rough, even with washing and fabric softeners. I just would not recommend this union suit to anyone. Plus it wasn't all that thick/insulated. Very thin fabric."
"I just opened the package and right on top of the folded skirt, you can see threading that's coming out!! I will not even be trying this on. Also, the white looks like a nice, creamy white, but the outfit is like a pair of whitey tighties. If you want to take a chance, don't take it on the white. You'll be disappointed."
"Love the style, material and color, but it's very stiff and cuts in on top of my feet."
It did not keep my head cool for an extended period of time.  My old cotton hat keeps my head cooler for a longer period of time.
The fabric wasn't what I was expecting. Also the sizes run small so I returned it because it was super tight on me. I ordered a bigger size then what I wear because I wanted it to be big but it wasn't.
The blouse with its embroidery was very pretty ... but one run through a gentle knits cold water cycle unraveled nearly all of the stitching around the neckline.  The label simply instructed that the blouse be washed in cold water. A real disappointment.
Wide and not as comfortable or supportive as most Keens
"Okay I LOVE how this shirt looks. I'm usually between a small/medium, after reading the reviews I ordered a medium and it fit so great! Then I washed it. Now I am 5'6 and 130 pounds with long arms and legs. It shrank to the point that I have to keep the sleeves rolled up and it's too short now torso wise. I have to leave it unbuttoned or I would look like I put on an extra small/a little kids shirt. Thankfully I only needed it for one day in pictures but I spent money on it so I'd like to use my shirts for more than one use. It's a shame really because I adore the color and it's super warm and comfortable before washing. If that got fixed I would 100% order again and rate it higher."
"I was not impressed with these at all.  After trying them on, we never wore them.  They did not feel comfortable at all.  It was much like walking barefoot.  I would not recommend these.  I will be returning them, as this was not a good purchase."
"Great looking, extremely comfortable, but the buckles for lacing came off after ONE wear"
After a few weeks the platform completely fell apart. Very disappointed because I really do love these shows.
Very cute and good quality but it seems a little too loose and my kids can take these off quickly..
I sent them back.  Pinched my foot across the top with each step.  I had another brand that did the same thing and eventually it loosened up but I wanted comfort from day 1.
Terribly quality and see thru. Do not buy from this maker.
Size was way off.  I regularly wear a 12 and the size 12 of these was at least an inch too long
Fast shipping that's why I gave it 1 stars but the XL for like a small or even an extra small. I will be returning.
super itchy
"Poor quality, poor size, and the price written on the tag  is just 65.99, not as said 115, so you didn't get any discount actually. I definitely regret to buy it. I returned it. But I have to pay for the postage fee by myself."
"Wrong size , flat head made insertion difficult."
very hard and uncomfortable to wear. No give
"These leggings were great looking -- exactly as shown.  Unfortunately, the ""Free Size"" translated to XS or smaller; couldn't even get them on.  However, I had previously gotten another pair -- the starry night pattern -- and they fit great.  Take your chances."
"I bought this bag for 2 reasons: 1) I needed a bag for summer classes and 2) it seemed super cute and stylish. Unfortunately, I'm not happy that the colors are faded. The ""black"" portion looks navy blue and the golden fabric inside is definitely an ugly yellow. Nothing like the pictures provided by the seller. However, it is the perfect size for what I need to carry around which is 1 book, 1 notebook and a laptop (hence my 2 stars)."
"My wig was nothing like the picture. There was no black at all and was cut more like  A cross between a mullet and a scene kid.  I ordered the wine color was black and he looks like a reddish brown to me. the layers were so heavy in the front  so it looks like a short wig from the front. Being there was heavy layers in the front, the length was very stringy and thin."
Dark colors developed white pills after only a few washings. They now require picking and intense ironing to look decent. I have shirts that were $3 off Shopko clearance rack that wear better than these.
Hurt my feet when wet.
"This thing feels and looks cheap. The RFID blocking does work i checked it on one of my scanners. The very first two credit cards I put in the wallet torn the holder pouch and now they are worthless so I'm back to putting two cards in one slot. I would not buy this product again myself.
It does what it says it will do but i can see just within the week I've had it it won't last 3-4 months. My last wallet lasted me 5 years but then again it was a much better quality wallet."
Broke the first day I received it. Would not recommend.
"Wearing these for 5 minutes causes my ears to feel sore from the pressure. They are too small even when fully extended.
Maybe I'll go to my local witch doctor and have my head shrunken so I can actually get some use out of these.

Another $20 wasted because I bought something online instead of at a store where I could try it out.
I only have my self to blame."
"First, let me be clear:  These are NOT fully water-proof.  As the description says, the UPPERS are waterproof, but not the entire shoe (soles, etc.).

That being said, I wore these shoes while at Disney World and for a week or two afterwards.  They gave me terrible blisters at Disney World, which I was disappointed with but understood because I did a lot of walking and they were fairly new.  However, even after wearing them just on a regular basis (to the store, for a walk, etc.) I found them uncomfortable (the sole seemed too thin and made the bottom of my feet hurt/sore)

For those reasons, I do NOT suggest these shoes, especially with great alternatives like the Keen Newport and Newport H2 (I purchased a pair of Newports right after I stopped wearing these and LOVE them, big difference)."
"Although I read the reviews and anticipated it would fit as expected, it did not."
Seems comfy just too small
Weird fit. Ended up returning.
I am still waiting for it to arrive. It is getting chilly outside and would be a nice addition to my fall wardrobe.
Just too small in the crotch area. I order a size bigger then I fit too.
Very comfortable. Received for christmas and they are already falling apart but of course it's past the return window.
Looks good but VERY easily bent.
"Returned didn't like the funky ""leather band""."
"Cheap product. Seams came unraveled after second wear. Someone tried to fix a hole on the front of mine with white string! I didn't notice until after I'd cut the tags, otherwise I'd have returned it. Would be a cute style if not for those issues."
These jeans fit really well. I get a size bigger because Levis are always a little small for me. The only problem is they smell like chemicals. I cant get the smell out and its too late for me to return them. I am very disappointed because they fit so well. A epwaste of $50 for me.
Sadly I had to send these back...they were way smaller than expected...I had to pay for the shipping back so ended up being out a lot of money
"Based on sizing, reviews and the tag on the items themselves, medium is recommended for 34B but it's significantly too large in circumference and cup size."
Hard to set....
"it started pilling in 2 wears ,we were disappointed had to return it"
Not a fan of this scarf...I wanted to be but Im not. Its big but too small at the same time...not sure how else to describe it. Just not a flattering piece.
Too big. Returned.
Too short and not really narrow
"I wear a Medium so I purchased a Large; only to find out the coat was entirely too small. Within that situation, the company DID NOT give me a refund. :("
Runs small and there is no grip on the bottom. Just cheap plastic that looks like rubber but is slippery. Returned.
"I ordered two sizes bigger than normal, based off the reviews and they were still too small. Other reviews stated they were paper thin, I should have listened.  If you are smaller than average, or juniors size, they might work...but if you have any type of curves to you, good luck!"
One the second time to put on hook broke Very very soft metal -fragile
"The shoes are cute and light weight, but.... I am a fitness instructor and they do not last! My knees started hurting after a few weeks and I am disappointed with the purchase. What happened Ryka?"
"Cute in concept, but they were super tight in the calves (which is never a problem for me), and really loose around the waist.  They were also weirdly saggy in the front."
so cheap & fake looking
way too small. not true to size
This is not for you if you are a size 16-18 with any shape.  I felt like a stuffed sausage in this.  Wear with a blouse long enough to cover midriff otherwise I would not wear in public.  Sorry.
Very narrow and tight. Not what one would expect from altra.
Straps broke after a few months.
"The mask actually protrudes against your eyelids, and could easily scar your eyes.  The mouth hole is too small for adequate breathing.  Cutting open the eye holes is difficult, risky, and helps very little.  Do not buy this.  Do not sell this."
I traded in a larger pair for these because the larger pair were too big.  Going down a half- size became a bit small.  I'm thinking they will loosen up as I break them in.  I am very upset at the increase in price just because of a change in color.
"I could not have been more disappointed by this dress. The first thing I noticed was that the neck trim, while the same design, was a different color from the rest of the dress (dress is white/black/grey, trim is white/black/green). The neck trim stitching was very noticeably puckered in several locations. Even the fabric was poorly made, with black ""drips"" all over the white. And while the fabric is described as ""jersey,"" it is actually polyester knit.

Then I tried it on - or at least I tried to try it on. Turns out the bust measurement was a full 5 inches smaller than advertised. Needless to say I had no choice but to return it."
Returned.  Looked like a tent.
Way too small...although it said it wld fit me...could barely get them ovr my bootay
"Ordered two for each of my daughters, and both fell apart within ten minutes.  Horrible.  I'd give it zero stars but I cant."
"The hat is cute, but way to big for my 3 year old.  Even with it being adjustable, it doesn't fit right, so he doesn't wear it.  This is clearly an adult hat."
Not what I expected. Definitely returning this item. The material is not of the best quality and it runs big.
"Can they make these for girls with a butt. Seriously! I am stuck with plumbers crack or baggy scrubs. Nice material though, but for what it costs it should fit like a glove."
"Its was too small for extra large
Its a nice product and I like the colors and fabric
I wish it were a bit bigger and also more open at the neck"
Absolutely NOT a 3XL!! More like a Large. VERY disappointed!
Made in Afganistan.... What's up with that? These are supposed to be American Levis...
"This shoe runs on the narrow and small size.  I am an 8.5B and I could barely get into the shoe.  VERY uncomfortable.  Had to send them back.  the color is more orangy-red, too which I did not like."
"Extremely short and extremely small. If you have a shorter fabulous body this will work great, but not for plus size... No way!"
"It just doesn't get any worse than this suit! The material was super THIN. It's supposed to be for curvy women (I'm a size 12 in clothes 36G bra). I read many reviews on this suit and after all the rave reviews I decided to give this a try....I wish I hadn't! Thank GOD Amazon has excellent customer service and the return process was hassle free!
Back to the suit....the top was TINY. I bought it because of the reviews that it covers well endowed women well, this was not the case. I didn't try on the bottoms because if the top was that small I didn't see the point in trying the bottoms. I just did not like this. It looks good in pictures and that's about all. I would not recommend this suit."
Shoe size is not accurate.  Order at least one size larger.
"Something interesting: I got these boy shorts in black and yellow. The black ones are perfect, the yellow ones lost its shape quickly. They look ugly now. They kind of lost all shape. If I order again I might order them in black again. I wonder why this happened...."
"Strap was coming undone from tank top after 30 minutes. The top was not too small for me, just poor manufacturing."
Piece of crap. Returned it. Extremely undersized. Poor quality.
Too small for my face.
Ok for my Halloween costume.
"Look great, but run really small. I usually wear a size 10 pants.  Even the 12 was too small.  I gave them to my daughter and she likes them"
These flops were much smaller than typical shoes.  Also - no strap. Picture and description are deceiving.  Just a regular flop like you can get at Walmart or Old Navy.
"Was so excited to order matching PJs for the holidays. These arrived and we're slightly large and longer than anticipated, but not a big deal. Ordered a medium for a 170lbs, 5' 10' male with atheltic build. Decided to wash before wearing and they shrunk a lot - to the point of not comfortable to wear. Lost approximately 3 inches of length and are tighter everywhere. Washed in cold water and tumbled dried as per instructions. Same problem with women's. Incredibly disappointed."
"The tag inside said XXX, the hang tag said USA size large."
"When I received it, it looked lighter weight than I anticipated but nice. I ordered my normal size, but when I tried it on it was at least two sizes too small. Not even close. I would guess you would need at least two sizes bigger than you ordinarily wear."
"OMG!! I have worn the shoes a total of maybe 10 times, and as I'm lacing them up today I realize One of the straps that the laces go through has ripped off!  Not to mention I was already going to leave a bad review for the shoes because when I do work out and I'm doing certain moves the shoes come off!! Obviously I had them on tight to because I broke the lace strap!! Your foot also feels like it's being pushed to the side. Just really bad shoes overall. They're cute that's the only good point I will give them. I added three photos to show clearly how unused my shoes are in the broken strap that I speak of."
"I'm returning this. First it fits too wide and looks and feels like a bedroom slipper.  It also hit my middle toe in a weird place. I did not like the print at all. Online it looked black on black, but it is a black and bronze metallic print."
"the quality of the materials is fairly nice, but when i opened the packaging, it had been folded so many times, it seemed very un necessary because the packaging really only required one fold, and now the brim has many permanent fold marks in it....in addition to being small....i really cant wear it, i haven't ever had an issue wearing other OSFA hats or headbands. im going to try to smooth out the fold lines, and maybe try to find a friend that will fit it..."
"Never wear it, the colors weren't as I expected then to be"
"first of all, this pair of shoes is very light,it is good
However, the quality is not good. Just a few days to wear this pair of shoes, shoes there has been worn and broken. Now wear this pair of shoes, have broken place is grinding foot. I think I won't buy similar shoes any more."
"Fits adorable, however it came not sewn completely. There is literally a giant hole in the turtle neck area.  Also you can't tell the front from the back- which is fine, but you can just tell it's cheap. I'm just going to sew the missing seam, but I'm disappointed and wouldn't recommend"
"This was smaller / tighter than expected.  I typically wear an XL and ordered an XL.  It was NOT flattering.  Fabric was thin, so showed every bulge underneath.  I returned it."
"The pants are extremely tight and too close to looking like yoga pants to be worn professionally. If I could have gotten a size bigger, maybe they'd be better. Extremely stretchy and comfortable, with a much too high waist."
New review:  Bag lasted 5 months an broke.  Terrible for the money I spent.
My foot slips out if the sandal because the fabric is shiny.  No arch support. Looks like the sandal has a slight heel but it is flat.
"The empire waist doesn't factor in if you are larger than a C-cup, top ends up looking kind of weird with the elastic running across half your chest"
"well, im glad these only cost me $5. i normally wear a 14/16 and i ordered the xl size- they are huge. if the crotch was about 2 inches higher i could literally pull them all the way up to my chin and still have a good 8 inches length past my feet. im not super short, i don't even know how this is possible. im going to pray they shrink. the seller does not offer free returns so im not even going to bother.. it would probably cost me more to return them than what i paid. waste of time and money. if you're a plus size and tall, these may work for you."
"I ordered 2 pair in the rinsed color, they have a very strong chemical odor that only got stronger after washing them. I am returning them."
"The boatneck is too wide, so bra straps show. Wearing a tank underneath doesn't work at all. It's soft, but it just wears kind of uncomfortably/strangely in places. It'll work layered under a fleece vest or jacket. Disappointing, though."
"Way too small, fabric is thin."
"This is a very cute shoe, however, I don't know why they put a suede sole on the bottom of the shoe. Who does that.
I'm debating on keeping it and having it resoled or donating it."
After weeks of waiting the dress I received was too small. I ordered a six year old size dress and received a one year old dress. I also had to file a claim in order to get my money back. Would not recommend anyone takes the risk here!
"I needed longer laces.  The 59"" laces were two eyelets short of what I would have desired.  I needed laces to cover
eight eyelets."
"Order size up
Runs very small"
had to change the band within two months
These shoes did not fit right and were  a nightmare to return. I will never order  shoes or sneakers online gain. These shoes costs more to return than they  were worth. The sizes were inaccurately described.
"Sending it back, the fabric was cheap."
Dress is way too small. Should have listed to some of the reviews. I usually wear a 20 but I ordered a 22 since it said it was a bodycon fit. Figured this would give me a little more room. Could hardly get it on/off. So I ordered a 24. Same thing. Didn't fit any bigger than the 22.
"The chain on the charm band broke the second day, and the straps on the watch broke day 3. I am very disappointed. With all the similar styles of this type of watch, I chose this one- and I chose wrong. I love the look, and the style- but poor craftmanship forces me to give this product the lowest rating."
Legs too tight.  Too short for anyone with a torso.  Awful material
"Description states ""UPF 50+.""  Tag on hat states ""UPF 50+ excepting woven mesh.""  As most of the hat other than the brim and a very small patch on top consists of open mesh you get UPF 0 for the whole top of your head. If, like me, you wear a hat to keep the bald crown of your head from burning this hat is utterly useless."
Love my crocs but I did not like the fit of these. Too wide for me
"Way oversized. I have purchased Wide before, though not this brand and they were fine. These fell off my feet. I re-ordered the same shoe in regular width and they seem fine."
"Buyers beware: do not buy this t-shirt.  First, the t-shirt was not cotton.  It appeared to be made of a somewhat shiny, stretchy, synthetic material (rayon or polyester?).  I wish I could give you exact information about the fabric but there wasn't a tag on the shirt.  Second, the image on the t-shirt was blurry, like a cheap iron-on.  Third, the sizing was incorrect and runs much smaller (by a couple of sizes).  Then again, I may have been sent an incorrect size: it is hard to know without the tag.  It took FOREVER for the shirt to arrive and when I requested a return, the company only refunded $4.00 of the total cost (minus shipping).  They were gracious enough to let me keep the shirt, which I am using as a rag."
It already fell out and it's lost. Record time.
I bought 2 of these. Cheep scratchy material. I donated them
Very disappointed with this sock.  I was hoping to match the Columbia socks I have.  Not even close to the quality.  I would not recommend these to others.
Not the right shoe for us and normally we love keen's.
It's a t-shirt. It was huge. Pretty color. Got xl. Normally wears xl - xxl. Could of got lg. Or maybe even medium.
The size 7.5 feels like a size 6. It is just disappointing. I will be returning.
I wear another pair of Clarks Mary Jane Flats so I thought the fit would be the same; it wasn't. It was way too tight around the front of the shoe. I returned it and ordered a size 9 C/D but was sent a size 6 so I returned that item as well. Evidently the gray does not come in the size I wanted. I'll keep looking.
"Tough to match clothes to these socks. Plus, the embroidered shapes ball up and cause uncomfortable pressure points on her feet. You can see the impressions in her skin."
"The product itself is great. However, the color was not even close. We got a navy blue pack-good thing my kid was fine with it"
"I know most Halloween costumes are made with no thought to quality since kids just want the characters and parents will continue to buy them.  That said, I have had some lower-prices costumes that were made very well.  This was not one of them.  Had I seen this in person beforehand I would never have bought it.  I kept it because my daughter really wanted to be Zelda this Halloween but it tore the first time she wore it and wasn't even doing anything particularly athletic.  Also, the shoulder things are so beyond cheaply made that I guarantee you they WILL break just by putting them on.  Maybe even just by looking at them.  Convince your child to be literally any other character.  Give this costume a hard pass."
Too small and felt poorly made.
lamentablemente no ajusto....
"These fit smaller than most onesies, and they seemed to shrink in the wash. As a result, my daughter never really wore them. I bought her current size (in every other brand/clothing item), and these were skin tight. My daughter is thin too (30%ile for weight), so others probably would feel the same."
"Inappropriate and totally RACIST. I'd suggest this costume for anyone who who also believes that donald trump should build the wall. I know that many of your teachers failed to teach about the way Americans have destroyed the Native American culture, but this is straight messed up. Think twice before turning culture into a costume."
"Good material, but sizing is not right. Bought size 18 months, and my 11 month old baby can barely fit in it. She is a petite Asian baby at 30th weight percentile."
"The leg was way too large for my leg.  I missed the description, I guess."
"At first it was love at first sight put it on, and just a step on my erund it slides off I'm so disappointed cud I really like this. Waste of my money"
Can't recommend
"everything from China is super small, no matter what the order says.  SUPER SMALL"
These run really large. In the stock photo they appear to be a fitted/legging style pant but they are quite large in the thighs and rear and have a saggy fit.
Cute bag but I wish it was bigger.
Seem to be cheaply made maybe from China
"These tights are awful! They feel like a tarp, smell terrible, and are so obviously cheap, it's embarrassing. Don't waste your money."
to small not the right sizing scale
"The right boot was too snug, so I took my blow dryer on the hottest setting and blew hot air inside the boot.  I then put on the boot with a few pair of heavy socks on, and it stretched out to make it a bit more comfortable. The heel is awkward too and I ended up giving them away to Goodwill.  Bummer, because visually, they are super cute."
I ordered based on my shoe size and it was way tooo big. Had to give it away
"cannot understand how people thing this product ""fits as expected""!?!?!

these shoes are SO TIGHT, and I usually wear a 6 & 1/2 --- I ordered a size 7 just in case b/c I find ALL sketchers run small (and I've made the mistake of buying them in 6&1/2 before...)

they hurt especially in the toes and the width - so disappointed b/c I like them otherwise!"
I received blue pair of different lacoste model instead of Grey / Red
The sizes are not true to fit.
"Picture shows Blonde Wig clearly modeled after Donald Trump. Upon looking back at the description, I finally noticed it says 'brown' for the color. However, the wig is actually a deep red color, so neither the image not the color description are accurate. False advertising, very disappointed."
I ordered the extra large in these leggings due to most reviews stating they run small. I received it and I couldn't even get my leg through it. The material is very cheap and it is completely see-through. I gave them to my mom who is a side 6 and barely fit into them. Don't purchase!
ok but the elastic cuffs bind my ankles. I don't wear them now
"Okay, Here is an actual legitimate review of these socks because I seriously could not decide if I should buy them or not because of all the confusing reviews.

They are fuzzy, but NOT thick. In fact they are thin. I wear a size 11 and the socks fit just fine, but it doesn't matter what size foot you have because even when not wearing them you can tell the fabric is still REALLY THIN. Yes, they are soft, but it's not the plush thick fabric you want from Fuzzy Sock, I have regular everyday socks that are made of thicker fabric than these. Also, they shed like crazy, I got little bits of sock everywhere when I opened the package, and they feel like they are just going to dissolve while I'm wearing them. The quality is really sub-par.

The elastic bit at the top of the sock is such a cheap piece of elastic it doesn't do anything and the sock will just droop down around your ankle while you're wearing them, and also just proving my point at how thin this fabric is, you can see the white elastic through the fabric when it's around your leg.

The only way to make these seem kind of like good fuzzy socks is to wear two pairs of them at the same time, but it's still not the same, and my feet still got cold while wearing them that way, so good luck to men in search of fuzzy socks, don't stop your search here because these are not what you want.

I'm only giving them 2 stars because they fit, and they are fuzzy, but they are not good quality socks."
"This NB is horrible.. the top collar by the ankle started coming apart with in a week of wearing it.
Amazon was very nice and refunded the item. This left such a bad taste that don't feel like ordering any NB anymore."
"Wanted to like these, but wide was too narrow. The material felt flimsy with no support. Gave them to my neighbor."
I don't think these are real Crocs.  They were about a size and a half too big.  I am a 7 and these were more of an 8 1/2.
Emma Bearpaw boots are smaller fitting than other Bearpaw boots I have purchased. They fit tighter around calf and do not offer the comfort my other styles do. Will be returning.
"Went by their size chart. However their Large fits like a Small. FYI, this is coming from China, took almost 4 weeks to get here."
"No ""front"" or ""back"" to this dress which means there is the same amount of room for your boobs in the front and the back of the dress....which is terrible if you have any sort of chest. Dress looks ok in front and then pulls down the back. Poor quality and not worth your money."
"I returned this dress as it was too thin and showed undergarments easily. It would have shown the outline of the slip as well and I wasn't keen to follow other reviewers' advice of not wearing undergarments to make it look good. :-/

Aside from being thing, it fit as expected and was very flattering."
"These shoes fit as expected, when I first tried them on my infant son I pulled the shoe a little to get them over his feet and the elastic holding the shoe together would not retract back in the shoe.  So now the white elastic shows all the time and does not retract back in the shoe as it should. These shoes are a great price, but in this instance you get what you pay for."
ordered size is the one i always use but this shoe was too small nice looking but don't fitt
"it is not good at all , it isn't look like the pic like slim fit"
"Super unflattering fit and uncomfortable to move around in, it was always riding up around the armpits because it's not well fitted."
"Didn't like at all,seams on toe too thick."
The crystal is fine but the silver tone hardware that surrounds it has already started to turn color.
I ordered a small in this be I am a 2/4. This sizing is way off...I'm not going to bother returning it be it will cost more to return than the price. I've purchased this brand before with no problems but this one will go in the Goodwill bag.
Returned product size smaller than normal.
"These shoes are fashionable but not the BEST shoes to walk in.  There is no cushion or arch and I do not wear them except as a slipper around the house.  Buy Sketchers GO WALK instead, they are a much better shoe and  OH SO VERY COMFORTABLE . . . like walking on AIR ! ! !"
sole could be a bit thicker.
"Bottom cushioning is good, and extra padding at the heel keeps the shoe from slipping, but the toe box is painfully small. I normally wear a 10 N, went up a half size, then ordered medium. They are all so small in the toe I couldn't stand it. I've wasted enough money on Asics and am back to New Balance."
When they say runs small they really mean it!
"Way too much fabric and way too large.
Do your self a favor and resist the urge to order your normal size."
"Pendant is beautiful,  but very disappointed in the chain.  It is advertised as 30 inches and arrived on a 20 inch chain. Much too short for what I was expecting."
"The sweatshirt fit as expected, but color was faded like it had been washed too much. Not happy with the true color.  It looks like it should be a bright color but it is just very dingy looking."
had a stain on it
I bought these for some additional winter warmth with my Vibrams.  Not happening.  They feel cold just like synthetic material and provide no additional warmth at all.  Disappointed with the failure of my warmth experiment and the product.  They are expensive and not worth the money.  I wouldnt buy them again.
"The dress is gorgeous. The problem is it is cut EXTREMELY SMALL!!!!! There are also two spots at the neckline that looks like ink spots. Almost like the black bled through the yellow material on the neckline. I hate the fact that the dress is cut so small. The fit is horrible. I ordered a size larger in case it ran small and that was not enough. I won't return it but will give it as a gift to someone who can fit it. I wish it came in a much larger size, I might try to reorder the item."
This product doesn't deserve any star. Please see pictures below for  the best I could do to make a perfect fit.  Terrible material. With my size I could hardly cover up my bust. Please stop this.
arrived damage. the top was cracked in 3 places and the felt was separated from the cardboard sections
Looked cheap.  Not what I expected.
It's really cheap feeling. Like something you would find in the Halloween section of Big Lots. The color is nice though.
Product is falling apart. Was great at first but does not stand up to multiple washes.
They felt awful
"I've recently lost some weight and my normal bras (all from Aerie by American Eagle) don't fit as well and are a bit more hollow in the cups now. I've been wearing nothing but sports bras and bralettes with removable pads and miss the ease of snap closure bras for lazy days. I'm 5'1"", 90Ibs and went from 34A to 30-32A band sizing. It's been very frustrating finding bras in the womens department for my itty bitty small chest and Aerie carries nothing but wired bras and thin lace bralettes that can get very uncomfortable/itchy with long wear. I decided to venture into the young teens bra section on Amazon in hopes that with my new smaller chest I can find a comfortable, light weight everyday bra. I ordered other girls bra that fit me perfectly and decided to order these 36A girls Hanes bras. When they came I was shocked at how wide the cups were and how little molding they had. The band size fit me, but the construction of the bras were terrible! The cups fit me, but they were so wide it gave my breast an odd shape. Not the seller's fault at all, but more the manufacturer. The middle band between the cups in the front was also sloppy as far as seams go. There was excess fabric from this band and I could feel it when I had the bras on. Would recommend seeing these bras in stores first before deciding on purchasing it on Amazon. They have a really weird fit."
Cheap material. Stitching is loose. Picture is actually on back of shirt not front. Funny though!
"These are attractive and bright so they help you identify your luggage quickly. BUT, unfortunately one of mine tore off during my first flight. They are not able to withstand the rigors of being loaded and unloaded from a plane. I would not buy them again."
"I've been wearing this necklace for a few weeks now, it was shiny and cute when I got it just to realize that it s not silver, it got dark, can t be worn anymore. you get what you pay for"
"I should have known that there was something wrong when there's a leather jacket offered for $20 bucks. BUT I figured hey, this is Amazon, how bad could it be? As soon as I opened the plastic wrap package, the entire house was filled with this toxic smell that was really sickening. We hung the jacket in the garage and it stunk up the garage. It's hanging in the back yard right now, and when you go outside you can still smell it. It's going back in plastic. This time a garbage bag. Trust your instincts!"
"These look durable and might have worked, however, the strapping provided to go around the ankle of the boot was not sufficient for my winter boots and would not have stayed attached.  Unfortunately I needed to returned them."
"too small. I done it too a friend, who really need a jacket"
didn't fit me at all. and i got a big size.
It's a nice light jacket. However I usually wear a size small and I ordered a medium and the medium wouldn't zip over my size D breasts. Seeing as how I would like to wear a sweater under it I gave the medium away and ordered an x large so it runs small for sure
"I was so disappointed in these boots. Usually Teva shoes are the most comfortable walking shoes imaginable. I have happily worn out many, many pairs of Teva's Omnium Hiking Sandals, they are so sturdy and comfortable. Their sole and foot bed are the perfect shape and arch support, but for when hiking in cold weather, snow etc, sandals are a bit impractical.
 I bought these Kimtahs because from the outside this boot LOOKS like the same sole as the Omnium, BUT NO inside the boot is just the standard floppy insert over a rigid flat foot bed. WHY So Unlike other Tevas? I wore these for five minutes inside my home to test them out, and my ankle is aching, the boots are rigid, uncomfortable, and I imagine after hiking half an hour I would be limping."
"I hate this bra with everything in me. It looks like I have comes strapped to my chest. There is no support and even with size Ds, I have absolutely no cleavage. I do. Or suggest this at all!"
Jacket measurements do not fit. Jacket is way too small.
"Okay, the 8's felt like 7's. Literally could not even fit my toes in there. These hurt so bad to wear! Definitely order these hella sizes up..."
For my 7 year old it was too big and just kept flopping off and the tail doesn't even have a clip to clip on to her clothing.  Very disappointed.
This purse was larger than I hoped for and it was a hard leather and not soft. I prefer a softer leather.
Cute boots but they do not stay up at all unless you have legs the size of an elephants.
"I bought the black Levi's 501 four months ago in the correct size, didn't wear them a lot, washed them twice or three times, and now they are two sizes smaller in the waist and I can throw them away."
"Must wear shoes with the feet if you want them to stay on. Grab some bobby pins because the hat is just as too big. Don't expect this to be a flattering or sexy costume. I'm not a small girl, I'm about a size 12 so for me to say that this was big on me should really tell you how big it is."
"Returned them. They were very tight and hard to get on. They also have little to no flexibility, which is terrible for a child's foot."
"Fits like an irregular shirt, material keeps twisting around waist. Image is not centered on shirt. Made in Mexico by Tultex. Very thin material, 100% cotton. Fits a little small, best to order one size up."
Absolutely positively uncomfortable. And I typically like Michael Antonio's pumps.
Way to small meant for 4-10 yrs not young adults.
I've had hiking and all terrain types of shows before. These are extremely heavy and hard as a rock.
"When I removed these from the package, at least 2 pairs already had a hole in them.  It appears they weren't knit together really tight where the holes are.  Disappointed."
Short and very wide. Probably end up being a Jammie shirt.
See through and cheap. Might last a couple of washes.
"They look really cute....but I am not a fan of the fit. They are not as comfortable as lounge pants. The cut is weird,  I do not have a J-Lo butt, yet these pants seem to be cut lower in the back and kept trying to show plumber butt 8-s I am not a plumber, nor is that the look I was going for. Lol. They are just okay."
"It looks really cheap,and it looks like something you can just make urself. However....its pretty."
"I've bought these shoes twice so far. My mom loves these shoes. She works outside and she just absolutely loves these shoes. But after a month a wearing them, I have to buy her another pair since they're so low quality. They tear and split and just fall apart. My mom doesn't even have a manual labor job. She works outside with plants, not lifting anything heavy or running any marathons in these shoes yet they still fall apart on her. If these weren't her favorite shoes (solely based on appearance) I'd never buy from this seller again."
Unfortunately these shoes did not fit like all my other thong-type sandals.  Didn't take but a few steps and my feet were kind of slipping backward out of the shoe.  I wanted to love the fit because I really wanted to keep them but couldn't see paying the price for something I couldn't wear comfortably.  Appeared to be good quality!
"Shirt was awesome first time I wore it. Looked nice and fit great. After one or two washes it shrunk considerably. It didn't really shrink around my chest or stomach, it got shorter. It does not come down to my waste/shorts at all. It looks horrible and it unwearable."
The Shoe fit great.  It looked cheap!
"For something billed as ""athletic,"" this jean is not cut for boys with muscles in their thighs or glutes. They also were shorter than other styles in the same size. We are staying with Relaxed Fit for our fit, thin, muscular athlete."
I wanted these shoes to fit so badly but they hurt one foot because they're too narrow. I'm tempted to order another half size up because I love the color so much. So sorry to return these!
"The scarf arrived defective, has holes and scratches on the fabric. It's very upsetting considering extra long delivery time (around a month)."
Very small and tight. Not an oversized sweater at all.
Tore after the first time I wore it
"PHOTO IS MISLEADING... the headband makes it totally cute right? Sadly, it isn't included.  Quality of pants and shirt are not very great, so... I would have passed on this one."
"Pretty dress and color, as pictured BUT workmanship is below par for the price of the dress.  Shirring on mid section is uneven thereby making the chest fabric lower (right side) than the other.  Moreover, need to manually center the faux button detail due to this uneven shirring.  An okay dress to go to the groceries, I guess."
All of them ripped my first trip and they don't hold their shape at all.
"I have mixed feelings on these shoes. I bought them for crossfit workouts. They are very narrow, which is great for me, because I have very narrow feet. The problem I have is that the eyelet flaps where the laces go are way too narrow, so that I can't tighten the laces on top tight enough, because the eyelet flaps actually meet and touch each other. The eyelet flaps would overlap. I have narrow feet, but I've never had this problem with any shoes. This also makes the shoe laces EXTREMELY long, so much that I have to actually tuck them back into the lacing. For the price, I am not amazed by them. As far as comfort, they are light, but rigid on the bottoms. They work just okay for me, they aren't my go to shoes, more like the ""oh I'll wear these so I can wear them out"" I am unable to post a customer image, but mine look nothing like the picture as far as when its laced up. I didn't send them back, just figured I would use them for something."
The top offers virtually zero support. You'd have to wear a nursing bra as well which defeats the purpose of a nursing tank.
"Small and no ""give"" Like wearing spandex. ...my mistake, I didn't look at material, but unless you have no curves or you like to show them off? I would not recommend these."
"These shoes are no way like the old ones. They squeak when I walked in them. They never left my house on my feet. I own 5pairs of the old ones, and was so excited when I saw the blue. A beautiful blue color, u can't change out the insoles and use orthotics (Your own inserts) has memory foam, the shoe is not stable because it's too soft ....I sent it back the next day. And I love Amazon, if I buy something through Amazon, and not happy with the product, they take it back, no fuss...Love you Amazon!"
Broke first time I wore it..I mean in pieces..Cheap junk
sleeve was too short
Changes color quickly
These break and wear down so easily.
I was not impressed by this dress.  It was too tight and I went up 2 sizes.
It looks and feels extremely cheap.  The fleece is thin and made with a very cheap fleece material.  Disappointing for a Columbia coat.  Good for kids/teens but not for an adult.  Returned.
"sizing is great, if you understand the new-ish popularity of east-asian clothing. at least some of the companies (like this one) are providing ""US"" sizes alongside the actual-mfgr-size.

I normally wear somewhere between medium and large (somewhere between 40"" - 42"" chest. depending. lol.)

I've found with companies like doublju and match/matchstick, that their 2XL (aka ""US Large"") is perfect. (the only time it's been a little too small is on things like fitted dress shirts)

the cut and fit of this henley is great. the color (I've only got charcoal in the longsleeve version) is spot-on from the picture, and quite nice.

but I have a huge complaint: the buttonholes are way too small.

I can barely button/unbutton the shirt holding it in front of me. good luck doing so while actually wearing it. and I have to assume once it's washed, the buttonholes may shrink even smaller."
Too small and too young.
Wore out after one use
Heavier than I like and the insole is cheap
"Too small, Serves mainly as a lunch bag. The color is actually hideous,"
I was looking for a rolling backpack I could put under the airplane seat. The black one was way too big for that
The front hem tears away and  thread runs across my feet at the toe after the first. I wasted my money.
it is a cute outfit and a good price.  However the pants are terrible they do not fit right nor stay up.  My daughter wore this one I still use the top but the pants are useless.
"Honestly I was very disappointed when this showed up. I ordered the largest size they carry(3X) and I usually wear a 2X depending on brand and this won't fit at ALL. It was more of a size large. Honestly ridiculous considering the price of this. I won't be buying anything from here again.

I will say though that it is very cute, if it fit."
Not really impressed with the quality of the crystals and the metal is less than what i want.
"This show is very light which is good, but it runs narrow so my D width foot did not fit comfortably in their D size.  The upper leather is very stiff and does not give much when putting on the show.  Finally, the 'soft cushion' feel is from an inexpensive insert they call memory foam which is at most 1/8"" thick.  It did not give me the cushion effect that I was hoping for, so I returned them.  This is not a leather that gives ... it is stiff and if your foot does not fit well, I believe you will be uncomfortable wearing the shoe."
"I didn't like the way this fit and for the price, the quality just wasn't there. I am 5'8"" and the short part of the dress under the long train pieces was way too short. The lace part up top was see thru except for the pads to cover your nipples which to me was totally obvious while the dress was on. Also, the clasp that hooks behind your neck is just metal hook to cloth, not metal hook to metal hook so I found that too challenging to clasp and also a risk of that breaking and not holding. Not for me. Returned with no hassle."
It was all ready fairly small. Then I washed it. Now it's practically a man thong.
it not what i was looking for
Don't waste your money. These fell apart in about 2 months. My husband has terrible luck with shoes off amazon
It's cute but runs large.
Ordered 2 of these different sizes and both were exactly the same size different tags not a good choice
"I spent some time trying to find a size comparison what medium or large would be equal to on the item page on Amazon. I wear a size 9 shoe so I took a chance on a large. When they arrived on the bottom is marked  US9.5- 10.5, I thought great I guessed right. The only way I can come close to getting them on is without socks. This is probably why they were half price. Hope they will stretch."
"I had to stretch these and they still hurt, toe box too small"
"Too big on top, for bustier women. Cute top and well made, but strange fit."
"The quality is so good! BUT...IT IS TOOOO  HUGE! I wear 32"" usually , This pants has 34"" who it says 32""!!"
Worst luggage set ever bought. First you have to peel off the protective film from each case wich is a pain. The cases stink of chemicals and are not sturdy. Do not think of sitting on them while you wait at the airpot. After one trip already scratched badly. Do not buy this!
"The only good thing is that I received them before the estimated date. They came with a sort of chemical smell to it. Also if you are a thick girl, these shorts are not for you"
"Items broke in two places after purchase. The bottom hinge disconnected on one side. And, on the inside, one of the slots has broken apart."
"This is cute & very well made for an inexpensive item. However....I am a size 8/10, being 5' 8"" tall. The package said it is a size 14/16; the waist is too tight, arm length is about 5 inches too short, waist sits about 4 inches above my waist (and I'm short waisted!), chest area is very tight. My contention is this is a child's 14/16 being passed off as a ""one size fits all"". Very good thing this is ""free returns""."
But it doesn't last long at all it easily stretches out of proportion. And the hooks easily pulls out mine did didn't even get to wear it for a good 2 weeks and 2 of the hooks came out of its place.
"These do in fact replace the insoles of a Klog shoe, but are not of the same quality that was in the original shoe.  They are much thinner and flimsy.  I had my original shoe almost 3 years before purchasing this insert, and even after just a few times of wearing the shoe, I can tell a huge difference.  The insert is not made to last, nor does it have the cushion or support of the original insert.  I also had to cut this insert to fit my shoe even though I purchased the correct size.  Very disappointed."
Returned this item because it wasn't a beanie type hat. It stood straight up.
"Came not laced, can't get the lacing through the loops to save my life!!"
"My so. wears a size 3 and that is what I ordered. They were HUGE! Probably a whole size too big. They are obviously plastic,  it served their purpose for last minute shoes for a school program"
It was very small and uncomfortable.
"The color purple I got didn't come near to matching the picture, it was very light purple which was a big bummer."
"I fell in love with these pants (I purchased two of them) when I just got them. Admittedly, I curvy in all the right places. However, upon washing these bad boys shrunk faster than my last relationship. Why didn't the seller include such instructions on pants. I can no longer wash them."
They were smaller than expected. I'll be giving them to my goddaughter.
"*This was not a mailing error, this is an error in how the manufacturer packaged the nose*
When I got this nose it was so flattened, I couldn't wear it. Instead of putting the nose in a box where it can't get bent, they put it in a plastic bag (teeth on the bottom, face part, facing up) so it gets squished and stretched just being the bag to make it too wide to put on your face. While it's great in theory, make sure you buy it a few days in advance to put rubber bands on it!"
"I wanted this to be a hit, but the ruffles on the bottom ripped pretty easily and overall it just felt cheaply made"
Fit as expected but bad quality.
Cheap and don't do much good.
"Quality not what we expected. Also they slip off as you are walking, Was afraid my husband might fall, we were very disappointed and had to return"
The strap broke after a couple of weeks.
"Way too small and stiff.
I ordered my true size (11 1/2) I could barely get one foot in, I didn't even try to jam my other foot in the other one. I didn't realize the sole was painted and not molded white, I'm not happy about that. That might be a deal killer when I return. I don't think I want my sneakers peeling after a few wears.
Too bad because the tri color burgundy/grey ones i got look awesome.
Id go up a full size (12 1/2) when ordering. True size was very tight."
"Bought this for my mom, got kinda gross looking after a few months"
"I did not return this because it took wearing to determine that it was terrible.  If you want to appear flat-chested and appear to have NO breasts, except under your arms, this is the one for you!  No support at all.  The only positive is that you can squash yourself from the front."
"The hand bag is way too small. Not what I expected, not fit for its intended purpose. Amazon was great and offered a full refund."
I don't know what I was thinking. I wanted to stretch a pair of shoes but it didn't work. Won't buy again.
Stone fell out after wearing it for an hour.
top portion was too tight
Opened package and a string of pearls was hanging! So that tells me its junk.
"I had Avia shoes for work for many years, and they were great.  So did a friend of mine.  When our workplace changed our dress code to black, we both went for these, without even knowing that's what the other was doing.  When we figured it out and got to talking about it later, we learned that we were both miserable, and frantic to figure out what to do.

Those ""removable insoles"" that they mention in the product description are in fact removable--and it's a good thing.  They are PATHETIC.  Very thin, NO padding at all.  They actually feel HARD.  Shouldn't shoes that tout themselves as walking shoes have some padding?  I know Reebok's walking shoes do!

I ended up pulling out that miserable excuse for an insole and replacing it with a $20 insert, which made these shoes a lot more expensive.  But now, they feel too small, as the extra thickness has taken up too much room inside.  I will never buy Avia again.  It's too important to keep feet comfortable to risk them on this brand.

One more thing.  I found no evidence whatsoever on or in the shoes or the tags that they are leather.  Given that leather is a great selling point, it's hard to believe that this would not be printed somewhere.  I couldn't detect a leather scent, either.

Recently, I bought two pairs of Reeboks--Zig Heel and Zig Tech Shark, both of which are very comfortable and well padded.  Unfortunately, neither are black, but with their custom option, I just might pay the big bucks and put some black ones together."
"I did a lot of searching and sifting through reviews before buying these sandals. I must have gone wrong somewhere. I wear an 11.5 and have somewhat wide feet. (Usually a wide shoe is too large , but most women's sandals seem to be really narrow so I was hoping for a happy medium here) Most of the reviews say that these seem to run a size bigger, but I think they are sized accordingly. I ordered an 11 thinking they would be perfect , but I should have probably gone up a size to be safer.

The width was the most disappointing part. I didn't have any trouble with the strap closest to the ankle , but when I tried to adjust the strap over my toes, I could barely make it! I managed to get the strap velcroed, but it was extremely tight and extremely uncomfortable!

These probably fit well for others, but for someone who's in between sizes and widths, this isn't your sandal, move along. :(  I'll be sending them back."
Many people said it was too small and they are correct! I normally wear L to XL. I ordered an XXL so it would flow nicely. Its tight! The material feels more like spandex than anything else. If I were to size this XXL shirt I would say its a tight L. For smaller people who don't have a few areas to hide this might be okay but for us women who are size L and up and don't want bra lines or muffin tops to show forget about it in this size.
"Unfortunately I received the boots 2.5 sizes larger than I had ordered. The order and receipt had the correct size but the shoes I got were not the correct size so I am not sure how they feel on, they look decent but I decided to return them because I would rather go shopping around for a different boot."
"Well,  I am no longer happy. I wore the first pair for less than two hours while cleaning the kitchen and loving room and the right one broke. I assumed it was a fluke.  I had the second pair on for less than 30 minutes total.  Drove to town and again, the right one broke while driving.

Put on the third pair, walked maybe 20ft to my desk and sat down to work.  Again. The right one broke.  I wasn't hard on them & fit was perfect.  I'm sad now.

I was so excited to find these flip flops at a fair price. I used to purchase these at a local store but they no longer carry them. They have been my favorite summer shoes for over 10 years.  I usually buy three pairs each summer."
The look of the shoe was fine and just as pictured but the sizing is way off. I normally wear a women's size 10 and ordered the size 11. They were rediculously small. They fit like a size 9.
"This bag is not durable at all. If you want it for 1 notebook, it is fine, but not for traveling it is for sure. Do not buy it."
Left show was very uncomfortable...On someone else they  might be fine..Very cute shoes...
"It's a very nice small wallet if you just want to carry a few cards and some money and not bother with a purse....too bad, mine was with chalky stains in both compartments.im not going to return it because it's not worth the hassle.....but I would not buy another one from this seller because it looks used..at least the outside look nice! i got it in purple and it looks identical to the picture."
"Easy to big and thin.

It's see through and cheap looking, no shape at all but too baggy to cling to anything.

I'm curvy at 5'1. Medium didn't got 34 DD or 37 hips."
Terrible product
"Awful product. Do not buy. Does not even look like a city, just blobs. Material isn't great."
fits perfect. Also super comfortable I use it almost every day for about 4 to 8 hours.the only negative that I have to say is that this material is stretching a little bit and I looks like it's fading out otherwise great product. This is an update all of the product . I purchased it in April . now the inside ripped am  is poking me . I got it about  one months and less it two weeks . Don't buy it.
"After the first wash they became more see-through and also shrank a lot. They fit me great before, now I can barely put them on. Get the Levi's 200"
"Didn't remember to change the size when ordering multiple items, my fault."
"I used to be a big fan of Hanes' women's undergarments. The no-line panties were a staple of my lingerie drawer for years. About two years ago, I bought two new packages, and in each package, the patterned pair's waistband was a full inch larger than that of the solid-colored pair. I bought another package last year and had the same problem. I also tried a package of the cotton ones with the really wide waistband, and these nylon ones. In every package, there was a size variance between pairs. So last month I bought a package of Bali panties. All three pairs were exactly the same size, and they fit perfectly. Goodbye, Hanes."
"Fiancee cant even wear this because it is too large..Even after washing AND drying, it is still waaay too large"
Had to return these shoes. They were so stiff I couldn't walk. It's too bad because they looked like they would be perfect for my Christmas outfit. Nice look but extremely poor quality.
Bought a cpl of pairs over the last cpl years .This last pair was to small even after ordering a 1/2 size bigger then I needed
"I am 5,6 and about 130 pounds and the sweater is comfy and warm but it was too short. It looked weird on me and I think it is for shorter people."
Item is what it says it is but the sizing is off you need to order a couple sizes bigger then you think that are going to need.
"It is a unique watch for the price but, it looks cheap. The black paint is coming off. I bought a gold one and silver and those ones look far better."
"The workmanship is great.  The fit to long through the crotch.  This is a common failing, there must be some kind of standard assumption about butt size."
"As our nice quality but sadly not true to size, my daughter has had to return them and purchase another...Hoping the half size will be the key"
"These shoes did not help my plantar facisitis, in fact may have made it worse. I wore them for 3 weeks before they began to get holes in the back of both shoes where there's not much motion against my Achilles. Worst shoe I've bought in my life. Total waste of money, could've been much better spent on a pair of Nike Shox, which have been the best thing for my feet but are very hard to find right now."
"No good, cheaply made"
"The material is very thin and really can't be worn with thin tops.  There is not good support for a full busted woman like me, 40 C.  The lower band is itchy."
This bra really offers no support at all for larger breasted women.  I am a 38DD while nursing and this offers as much support as a tighter fitting cami.  Would not recommend and will not be using.
I wear a size 44DD in bra but my waist is a 28 inch and this was way to small! And broke quickly o well it was cheap anyway
"Odd size.
Huge sleeves and shirt wasit.
Seconds"
"Unfortunately, these are too small.  They may be irregulars.  I ordered the size that I have worn for years.  They are poorly manufactured."
"sorry but does not fit into the holes of all tennis shoes as they are made small and the part that you fit thru these holes is to big  good idea, but they don't fit all shoes."
"Very strange for. Too large and the plastic between the toes really hurts. Tried to contact for a return, no response."
The strap on back of the show gave me a blister. I donated shoes to homeless shelter. I will not PURCHASE nothing again.
Ill fitting. Returned it. Very awkward.
XL Fit way to small on me and I'm 5'4 165 pounds. Cant zipper back or raise my arms. Also came with a huge rip in the arm. So dissapointed.
"Look great, but faux suede rubbed off after first wear....& then they looked awful..."
"I have wide feet and even tried going a size down, but the shoe is excessively wide. I had to return it."
"This purse is incredibly rough, cheaply made and thin. I feel like it would rip open if I put anything inside of it. The purse itself isn't very deep but the strap is very long - which is nice. Not a complete disappointment... however, it's pretty close."
These would have been cute if they weren't so narrow and small. It isn't true to size. I may have needed a whole size bigger but I wasn't willing to chance it.
"I usually love Burt's Bees clothing for my baby. But this suit just isn't designed well. There are only 3 snaps on each leg- at the ankle, knee, and crotch. The spacing is also pretty spread out on the torso. It leaves huge gaps and his legs, diaper, and tummy shoe through. I've given 2 stars for soft organic cotton and good fit, otherwise. If I hadn't already washed it, I would send it back."
"I normally wear a M or L. After checking the manufacturer size guide, I found I was just under the L measurements.  The guide recommended ordering one size up if you were close in measurements, so I got an XL. It was very loose and baggy straight out of the box. Washing it may have helped shrink it some (as it did for another dress I purchased from this company with a similar fabric), but the belt was missing  from my dress. With the potential loose fit and no belt to help detract from the bagginess, it was not flattering. Overall, the dress itself was made well and the fabric was not thin or see through (sky blue). I really liked the idea of this dress, but with two strikes against it, I opted to return it. I am strongly considering ordering another in a smaller size and darker color. I don't believe it is a bad product, and I think with the right size/color/belt, it would be a lovely dress!"
Size is not true to form...
needs to be a beef t by hanes
Liner ripped
"Very cheaply made.  Packaging was extremely poor and inadequate.  One of the links was broken on the necklace.  This is just for a Halloween costume, so hopefully I can fix it.  Will not buy from them again. Will not recommend them either."
Had to return didn't fit Runs small Seemed to be good product
For younger women
The crotch area was made from a weird material that made them unwearable.
"I have big feet and really am comfortable in a size 11 1/2...good luck trying to find that!  But these should have been too big, if anything.  My toes were right up against the toe of the boot with skinny socks.  Could not possibly wear these.  What a disappointment."
"These are great looking shoes but offer little to no support. And not as comfortable as the other Clarks Ive owned.  It is also not waterproof or even water resistent. Well, I suppose in the desert, you don't worry about water.  I tried spraying some waterproofing on it several times. No dice. I am disappointed overall. Maybe I was expecting too much. But it is well made for what it is supposed to be."
"I have been using this bag for sports gear for a few months. Unfortunately, it has not held up. The stitching is coming apart and the strap has come off of the metal clasp. Disappointed."
I ordered an extra large. Unles you are very thin this will not fit. Very disappointed way to small .Gave it away to someone who is a size much smaller than me.
Perfect fit but not for running.
If you have boobs tough luck lol
Very thin leather. Sent back....suspect it would not last long.
Easy to use but the clips are in the way when nursing. Watch baby's eye and skin.
Very poor quality fabric.  It is such a cute design but made with very poor quality fabric.
I ordered the 2xl but received a shirt that was more like XS. Will have to pass it on to a much smaller friend.
Too small to carry much of anything in.  Sturdy but I would not purchase it again.
"The Nike Air sole is a huge gimmick and doesn't seem any different than any other shoe. Way too expensive for what they are. The leather is too soft to be stable for the foot in a wedge. They look okay, but only if you have delicate legs. Do yourself a favor. If you're looking for a comfortable, low wedge, go with Lifestrides or Aerosoles. Both are great values and much more comfortable."
"Blades fall out very easily. My kid was pretty disappointed, which means I was disappointed. Wesley Snipes."
"Beautiful on the outside, but painful on the inside."
"This arrived smelling like mildew. After washing it, it was much closer fitting than I had hoped for beachwear. Since the sizes were listed as ""US"" I expected my normal size to be appropriate. The material itself is not what I expected either. It is described as 'silky' but it feels more like something you'd find in Leisure Suit Larry's closet."
"this was a poorly made sandal, the toes are too long. the ankle part is too small for me."
does not fit right.  Either than insert is too small or the outside shell is too large but neither fit correctly.
"They shoe is very nice looking and sleek. It runs very narrow though. It makes it very difficult for my 5 y/o to put them on. And she has complained that they squeeze her feet too much. She doesn't wear them much because of that. Also, the tongue on this shoe is very short so it slides down below the Velcro strap and makes it uncomfortable for the top of the foot. Overall a poorly designed shoe. Would not buy again."
Zipper is terrible. My petite 4 year old daughter struggled to even breathe and move wearing it the first time for her Cinderella party until finally the poor quality zipper busted open within 5 minutes beyond repair. I couldn't return it because I bought the dress over a month before her birthday so excited to have it for her party. Now I'm at the point of no return with a broken dress that wasn't exactly cheap.
"Not leather or ""genuine cowhide"", made out of a weird foam-felt type material. Looks cheap, feels cheap. Comes with a gizmo to create another hole if the belt is too big, but no worries. It is being returned."
Cheap and has flaws all over fabric. :(
Just looking at this kind of lock hurts my eyes. A thief can use a pair of pliers and bend the in right out of the socket. Get the L&C tsa CABLE lock instead. Then the only thief will be the sticky-fingered TSA inspector.
Smaller.
I love gold but after one wash of these the gold faded so much I cant really wear them for raves anymore only tanning at home if that. Otherwise this fit is great I just cant use them for another rave which is unfortunate they discolored so much after one delicate wash.
I bought a medium and it looks like an XL. The tag says M so I can't send it back.
Way too big. Thought it would be smaller
These fit poorly. I've bought them in the store and they are perfect. I bought these because it was a five pack but they are different. I'm sending them back.
These socks are super thin and have zero arch support. I can tell they won't last long.
Total wrong purse!
i ordered green and received grey one !!
"Cool shirt!  Until I washed it.  So much for president shrunk,  it shrunk about 3""in length on the first wash and dry
 I'm very bummed cuz my hubby Ralf liked it :("
"I have to send these back!!  They are at least one size too small. They look like women's size 10.5, not men's."
The zipper broke
Broke right after I opened this box.
Size was at least two sizes too small.
"This wig is terrible. It hung in my daughter's face and she could not see a thing. The way it is shown in the picture, it is parted off to the side and the bangs sweep across the face. This is not the case. It is parted straight down the middle and the bangs are both curled on each side and they dangle directly in your face. I did not plan to style the wig because... it's a wig. I simply wanted my daughter to have fancy hair for mermaid party, but when I put this on her head she was miserable. I am returning."
"The lunchbox was VERY small. I can maybe fit a sandwich with a string cheese and icepack in there. The tag  on the lunch box did not specify if it were insulated which I thought was weird. The size of the book bag itself would be perfect for a 4 year olds. All in all it is a great size backpack for what we are using it for. I wish it had a double zipper though so I can open it from the top and not the side. The zipper ends right next to the side pocket is so if you have a cup or bottle of water there it is almost impossible to open which is not so fabulous. I don't think I would buy it again, but my son loves it so I cant complain.

**UPDATE not even a week later** I only used the backpack TWICE and the lunchbox literally broke off of the book bag at the seams. I IMMEDIATELY called Amazon to see what they can do, hoping I can send them pictures and they can ship a replacement as I do not have a large enough box to package this back in and ship back. Well sure enough they wanted me to ship the stupid thing back. I refused! They sent me a defective product. I am more than happy to send pictures or other proof, but to send a defective product back is a waste of my time and energy. They refused to help me any future saying the only thing I could do was BUY another one and when I got the box for that one ship this one back to them and they can give me a refund. Umm yean NO, not going to happen. SOOO disappointed in this product."
Looks nice but the fit is awful and too small and narrow.  Practically zero arch support and flat.  They ended up being sent back after about 10 seconds on my feet.
Not set to the Levi's current sizing schema.
"These sandals felt good for the first month, with plenty of cushion and comfort while walking. Three months later, the heel is so thin that I may as well be wearing no shoes at all. I am thoroughly disappointed. Not only did the heel compress to the point of discomfort, the toe straps stretched out and made the sandals feel really loose. These sandals are better suited for someone who would wear them once or twice a month, not someone living in a sunny beach city.

I purchased this pair of sandals to replace a pair of 1+ year old Reef Smoothies. Today, I found my old Reef sandals in the closet, put them on, and was surprised to find how much more comfortable they are than this pair of 3 month old Teva's. Great initial quality and comfort, inadequate durability and useful life. In my opinion, the Reef Smoothies are a far superior option if you're looking for this type of style in a pair of sandals."
"The midsection fit well some what smaller but id rather that then being baggy,  HOWEVER the arms were to baggy for my taste. I'm contemplating exchanges but i think the middle area might be unflatteringly tight. i won't purchase again tho."
"It's hard to replace a belt. You know, the old one was the perfect fit, soft and comfortable. It has stretched with you for many years, faithfully holding the pants and shorts up. Not a dress belt, but the perfect work companion. And then the worst happens, it breaks and you're left with finding a replacement. This belt seemed like the perfect replacement. After about a week of wear, the side seams split on both sides at the buckle hole where the buckle sits when fastened. It looks like the leather is too stiff."
"These used to be my favorite shoes by a longshot. If you're new to the New Balance 99? series, you may be temporarily impressed because they are better than a typical sneaker. However, I have owned  6 or 7 pairs, but the last 2 pair have been noticeably inferior in quality and comfort than the previous pairs.

The whole shoe seems to break down and look very old and lose their shape after a few months of very mild use.

My latest pair started to smell horribly, far worse than foot odor. Oddly, one shoe was considerably worse than the other. Nevertheless, I used baking soda on the inside of the shoes thinking I just stunk them up. I repeated this process several times but no success. I noticed a brown stain on the outside of the rubber sole of the really bad shoe, and noticed it was seeping out of a small slit where the sole meets the bottom of the shoe. I smelled the dark stain and realized instantly that little stain was my problem. Unbelievably bad smell for such a little spot.

I suspect the adhesive is breaking down and leaking out of the shoe, and the resulting smell is extremely noxious and stunk my whole bedroom up.

Even without the noxious odor, these shoes are no longer worth the premium price, with the odor, New Balance should be paying us to wear them. I would avoid these shoes until some action is taken on the quality issues."

Unrealistic coverage
Muffin top accentuators!!!!
Somewhat small and very thin. Not what I expected.
"Ordered 6 pairs of these lounge pants advertised as mens XL.  These pants came marked XL, but in reality the size was small at best.  Iten was returned as not what was advertised."
These broke after one trip. The handles get stuck up or down and make them unusable.
These have the worst chemical smell of any shoes I've ever purchased online! STAY AWAY from these. Even after washing them several times there is still a strong smell!
To small party bag kids
Bought these for my teenaged daughter....they run very small....order a size larger than you would normally wear.
"The shirt was much larger than I expected it to be.  The sleeves were far too long, it was poorly proportioned in general and not well constructed.  Basically it looked like a super cheap version of what they are showing you in the picture.  I tried to exchange or return it but there was no response from the seller.  Not a good experience, I would not recommend buying anything from them!"
"Very very disappointed in these boots. Granted, I got a wicked deal and got them for $9 on sale with prime but it was too good to be true. They're warm and well built. That's where it ends. All good qualities are voided but the material adheres to the tread that holds snow to it.  The only thing it'd be good for is glare ice traction. However, here in Upstate NY, snow has already fallen a few times and whether it be pure fluff or heavy lake effect, the snow packs to the bottom of these boots, making it impossible for my daughter to walk. Literally 3 inches of snow pack on the ball and heel of the boots, and we only had 2 inches of snow. She kept having to sit down and punch the snow off to keep from falling. Picture is what was left on after scrapping  Absolutely ridiculous for a winter boot. Even thawing them off inside takes hours and the snow stays packed on tight. As far as sizing goes, she wears a 1 and we ordered a 3 to be able to put on wool socks and make it through our 5-6 month long winter. They seem to run slightly smaller than most brands like Totes ( also complete garbage btw)  They do seem well built minus the fatal design flaw of fabric over the tread. But it's too much of an issue for this mom to allow my daughter to wear them. After 2 wears, they're on their way to Salvation Army and I cancelled the order for ones I had planned on getting my nephew. Will stick with Kamik."
"I love this ring. I've had to buy it 3 times though, so hence the low rating.
The first time, the stone fell out. Never found it.
The second time it fell off my finger (so I suppose that is my fault)
This third one has lasted, but recently the stone fell out again.
It's beautiful, I get tons of compliments, but I wouldn't buy it unless the quality improves."
"These don't work for me. They feel like they're about to fall off, they pinch my ear. I can't seem to tighten them enough to solve the problems I'm having. The white ones also seem like they would get dirty, fast, judging from the type of fabric (that really thin, slippery rayon-esque material) and obviously, from the color, too."
This belt is not what I expected. I ordered a size small. A small should fit me. I'm a size 4. But it didn't. I now have to sent it back for a new one.
I am disappointed with theses suspenders.  The front clips slip off quite often.  Irritating having to find the one that slipped and gett it refastened while keep it from twisting.  I won't buy these again.
Worst dress I've ever worn in my life it kept riding up and material list cheap I want a refund I will take this to the Amazon but I want a refund when I got the box package that was even ruined upon receiving the item there were holes in it that I didn't notice until after Christmas family members told me about them I'm disgusted
Somewhat small on my 4 month 15 lb baby
"Have worn a couple times, not really happy keep hoping they will stretch in calf area but they are pleather. They are comfortable in foot area, so if you have skinny calf go for it. Otherwise cute for under jeans or pants look cheap to wear for skirt should make in leather."
broke after wearing 3 months
There is a seam inside the sock at the bottom of that nice little tab that keeps it from slipping down your foot and on a 5-mi walk it really started to irritate. I had an imprint from it when I got home.
"You know, I read the reviews that said the tops were too tight, but I had ordered them anyway.  Mistake.  They ARE too tight and I gave them away.  I'm not heavy and my legs aren't big, but these cut the circulation off!  They are like children's socks.  I had purchased previously (what I thought was the same socks) Hanes Sports socks and they were wonderful.  I'm thinking the original socks were the extended size as they come pretty far up my leg and are not too tight.  Wish I would have kept the first set's packaging to see exactly what they are as I love them, but these last ones that I just received are awful."
disappointed my square hole keys do not work with this.
"two and 3 star reviews are true, heavy, sturdy, not to mention THE cheapest sole I got in a working shoes ever.
Despite, I bought new custom made soles and foot pain went away but not pain in that little bone on the back side of foot just above the heel, and it was present only in right foot, so my best guess will be that 1 shoe was more 11.5 than 12(never had simular issues with shoes before).

Really, really wanted to love these"
I know there are a lot of positive reviews but I got these in the tan and thought they looked very cheap and trashy. I loved them online and couldn't wait to get them but they looked so different in person.  The quality of the material looks very cheap to me and it looks like they could have been made out of the tapestry material from Granny's old pillows.  They also (at least the tan ones I got) had this cheap and sorta trashy gold thread running through it - not nice thread but that shiny plastic looking kind.  Not comfy but not horribly uncomfortable either.  Mostly these were just really really ugly.  My mom and best friend saw them too and agreed that they looked like K-Mart quality vs department store quality (which is fine if you want that but I thought they looked much nicer in the online pic so it was a big disappointment to me).  They are very narrow/tight which worked fine for me but wouldn't for anyone with med to large calves.  :-(
Cute but poorly made. The toes are covered in fabric. This fabric tears and strips away entirely too fast and easily. Now shoes that should last several months or be outgrown are not wearable after a few weeks. Expected more from Sketchers.
Color and fit were not as expected. Its not sown correctly.
"This hat is not like the one pictured. Just like all of the other reviews said it is a cheaper design then what is pictured. They show a small rose with a raised embroidery rose that has a black outline. The hat I received has a flat embroidery rose and is only partly outlined. I think the rose is larger then what is pictured as well. It looks much cheaper and not as nice. My daughter wanted it and was hoping she would get the one pictured. The hat itself is nice, it's made of 100% acrylic and has a Velcro closure. She's keeping it and will wear it."
Nice shirt but runs extremely small.
At first I loved the boots. Went to wear them yesterday and a the thread on side had come loose and now has a big hole. I have had the boots less than a month. Not worth the money!
It shows two watches why the same if you don't get two at purchase and it doesn't even work
"Hurts ears, hinge is too tight"
"Keen! What did you do? I used to be able to walk into REI and grab a pair of Keens without even trying them on. Now, they are all too short. I tried going up from a 9 to a 10.5 and still my toe was pressing against the tip of the boot."
"Really a very cheap looking ring and the stones do not completely circle the ring.

Looks obviously fake so I returned it."
I ordered xl large and these fit like a small need to return please
"Size, look, design, and functionality was just what I was looking for, but this is very poorly made.  I bought it for the design features (needed the crossbody strap) and the water resistance for rainy weather.  Needed the large size for carrying winter extras since I commute on the bus daily for work, but I've only used it for a week now and it does not hold it's shape and the bottom is already falling apart.  Great idea, but poor quality.  Not worth the price.  Guess I'm in the market for one with the same functionality but made sturdier.  Would not recommend."
Decent product but had a strange fit. I returned.
"My wife wears Kalso Earth shoes on a regular basis, but this style doesn't live up to others.  It is too loose in the heel area and not as wide as others she has worn.  She can't wear them because they don't fit - slip in the heels even with heel cushions, so she will be giving them to Goodwill."
"I bought the 12-month size for my 3.5 month old, and he'll barely be able to wear it a couple of times before it'll be too small. The onesie is really tight. It's also not as soft as I would have liked. While  my son is on the big side - probably 15+ lbs these days - he should be able to fit in a 12 month outfit, in opinion."
The color is not the vibrant yellow as shown on the picture.  Its a very pale yellow.  I like style so Im keeping it.
there is a weird design flaw that makes the wires poke out away from your body where the bra meets at your cleavage.  This shows through your clothing & looks ridiculous.
Think Kmart house brand and that's these should be.
"Felt terrible, no arch support and felt very clunky, I returned them."
"Ouch! Yes I read the reviews and the suggestions to size up. But I don't think sizing up would help the situation. Where are my toes supposed to go? Cute shoes in the box but these do not work for me. Back they go. By the way, I tried the white leather."
"Pretty enough, but I have worn dresses from this designer that I liked much better.  I agree with another reviewer--  kind of matronly (older person type of dress; mother of the bride).  This should be listed as a ""column"" dress, meaning straight up and down.  The hip area is VERY small and narrow.  I would recommend an ""A-line"" dress if you have hips, not this one.  I am 5'6"" and the bottom of the size 16 dress was about 2 inches off the ground in bare feet."
"The length on these slippers is as the size indicates, but they are way too wide for me.  I did not read that in the description prior to ordering them.  I have the scuffs and love them, so thought I would also order these since the scuffs are pretty warm for the summer.  A mistake...I don't think I will be wearing them & may even send them back if I am still within the 30 day window for returns.  My foot slides all the way through them."
"It's a nice tank top, but it runs a little big.  I got the aqua color, which Ireally like.  I'm 5'3"" about 155 pounds and 38B.  I normally wear a large and I ordered a large in this.  It was a little baggy all around and it hit below my butt, which isn't a bad thing.  Overall it's a good tank top to work out in or for just lounging around.  I'll buy more, but I'll probably try a medium next time.

**Update:  unfortunately I'm changing my rating from 4 to 2 stars after washing it.  It shrunk a little, which I thought might be a good thing since it was already big, but it shrunk at the bottom only and stayed wide overall.  So now it looks short and wide.  The material is also stiff and low quality, which really shows after its first wash.  I won't be buying any more of these tanks."
I'm of average height and these were way too long for me. The rolls hit at the top of my foot
"This is a really rough fabric that had a scratchy feeling against my skin the whole time I had it on (hours). I don't intend to wear it again and will throw it in the trash. The elastic on the waist band is cut too small, is very snug , is not stretchy or covered. Even  though they are too snug, they are way too long, comically so. Yes, I washed them first. I couldn't find Fruit of the Loom, the manufacturer I prefer, so I ordered this one. I wasted my money."
"Cheap.

Check out my wishlist on my profile and I'll review more."
irregular fit
I can't even get this over my head and shoulders.
Hard to put on. Broke a months after wearing. Since I didn't wear them for a couple of months regularly after I bought them of course now its too late to return.  Since I didn't wear them for a couple of months regularly after I bought them of course now its too late to return I only wore them about 20 times .
Waaayyyy smaller and shorter than expected
"The ridges on the soles of these shoes make me feel as if I am walking on pebbles.  The shoe is attractive, just uncomfortable for me."
As tight as possible it still just falls right down to my nose.
So my mom wears a 9 1/2. We ordered first 9-10.  Was too big. Then went down to 7-8 .. Too small... Would not recommend these shoes as the sizing is obviously not USA sizes..
The handle on this backpack broke after 2 weeks of light use. The zipper broke shortly after. Very disappointing.
I bought a size larger then I  wear and it is still to small
Beautiful watch and love the ability to change the straps to match my scrubs. But it stopped working after 2-3 months due to moisture on the inside. Not sure why since I don't wear in shower and don't submerge in water. Not worth sending back since it will cost more to do that than what watch cost. What a shame - it was beautiful. Got lots of compliments when I was able to wear.
"The glasses show up with permanently painted/etched marketing on them.  Exchanged them once, thinking this was a mistake, I mean who would put marketing material permanently on the lenses of something you need to see out of?  Grrrr

Would give them zero stars, but not available, so I guess the one star is because other than the markings on the lenses, they seem very well made."
"I ordered a size lager knowing I normally fit into a medium (I'm 6'5 and 200lbs, in fit shape) but for anyone with a butt, this will not work out... It fits great in everywhere but the backside..."
These are definitely the worst shoes that I have ever tried. The bottom is comfortable but the edge all around it is so hard that it hurts every step I give. My heels were so sore that I didn't try them a second day. I wasted my money.
Horrible. Can't believe how uncomfortable these are! Unfortunately too late to return because I wore them once!
Very fake looking-- like straw
This does not have the .925 stamp though the description states it has a solid .925 silver core. It is a pretty bulky bead compared to the other beads on my bracelet. I decided to keep it regardless. The glass is pretty.
"Sandal a full size too large.when I compare to another same size Birkenstock, almost an inch longer in length. Also too wide but is not labled wide. It says medium width."
"I was very disappointed in the shoes, however, once again, AMAZON was very supportive in how to return an item
that did not fit.  I have high arches, and this particular shoe cut into my foot."
Such an awkward fit. If you get your normal size it's way to big. And if your big chested don't even bother.
It is small and color is totally different :( My hubby couldn't wear it at all and we had to send it back. We were expecting the BROWN which how it is on the pic but it came out different
Did not like at all.
It came from China. This coat is does not fit an adult it would fit a child. Most Chinese have smaller frames. Customers should be notified of this. I threw my receipt away so now I'm going to have to find someone who wants to buy it.
Was too hard to be comfortable.  Shipping mess up the flower too and some of the gems were coming off. I had to return it.
I love the look of these shoes but they were too small :(
Very cute....however the construction of this sandal has no support whatsoever. I walked about 3 hours and ended up throwing them away and going barefoot. Caused terrible foot pain!
Matte color isn't great
Much smaller than stated size.  Have a similar shirt from the same company that fits well.  Not impressed...
"Just got it, looks too cheap to wear."
It looked prettier in the picture. Very bulky.
"I'm 5' 9"" and 160 pounds and I always wear medium shirts.  I ordered this in black Large/US Medium and charcoal gray in X-Large/US Large.  The Large/US Medium was a nice slim fit, the gray a little big.

I liked how it looked and felt, but there were loose threads all over the black shirt.  Almost snapped some threads that were loose and got caught around two buttons.  The charcoal gray one had several buttons almost fall off while I was unbuttoning the shirt to try it on.  The threads on the buttons were so loose that they practically came off entirely.

I would definitely have kept one or both shirts, but it feels like really sloppy craftsmanship and poor quality"
"WAY too small!  Were these for girls, not women?"
"There were a few duplicates and one of the pieces was missing a gem. They enclosed s paper that said they inspect and take pics of each package, that's why I didn't bother contacting them since they are so full of themselves but had flawed product I figured it would be a waste of time. The quality of everything else was what I expected. I was definitely hoping for more necklaces since they had a bunch in the photo but only got one and like 4 rings, everything else was earrings that had duplicates. Oh well I guess that's what I get for the price..."
"They look like MBT shoes but they are nothing like them. These shipping especially are so uncomfortable, just trying them on and walking around to get a feel of them hurt my feet. I gave them a try but I'm hoping to return them."
"It is so tiny, it looks like it should be worn by a little girl or even a doll.  Very disappointed when I got it."
"The corset was really small for a large, I would have returned it but the restocking fee was too high."
THE APPLIQUES WERE NOT AS NICE AS SHOWN ONLINE
Stone fell out the first time I wore it. Some poor soul thinks he's found the Hope diamond.
"You can often tell something about the product just by the quality of the box it comes in.  This watch came in a cheap cardboard box that tried to look expensive but failed miserably.  That, as others have already pointed out, pretty much describes the watch itself as well.

The description says it's crystal encrusted but honestly the crystals look like glass to me.  Maybe it's just me.  And the plastic wrist band for whatever reason needs to be adjusted by a watch-maker.  And the whole thing--it's so big and gaudy looking that I don't really want to wear it.

All in all, this was a terrible disappointment.  Both my husband and I have Invicta watches and love them but this one was just blah."
"Good idea, but it was difficult getting them through my lace-up holes on my sneakers. Too bad, I like the color selection."
I didn't expect to lose the top two buttons by the end of the FIRST DAY WEARING IT!
"Suit does not hold up well at all. It's cute & fits well before using. Once used, outer (skirt) layer of front stretches out for no reason & there's also no breast support. Color fades terribly in general but even worse on front half of suit, making a big contrast in color between front & back. I've only worn it to the pool 5 times & it's a mess. Will be returning."
"I have a handbag by this company and love it. That is why I selected this brand. The shoes looked just as I had imagined. Technically they fit, but the front part is really short on the 8/8 1/2. The cracks/spaces between my toes show - just a small amount. No. My toes are not long. They are a little shorter than average. If they added about 1/2 inch more to the front part over the toes, this would be a five star. As it stands though, I do not like the shoes and sent them back."
These are super cute and I got a size 8 because that's what I normally wear in shoes. but I had a hard time getting my foot in and then they are snug at the toe. The calf fits perfect though. I wish I ordered a size 9 instead because now they are $40 instead of $16. 
"Not only is it not for Kids, because it is way too big, the brim arrived totally wrinkled! rendering it unwearable!"
Synthetic material extremely wrinkle prone. Definitely need a petty coat and professional pressing. I'm 5ft4in 34D I weigh 140lbs wear size 7/8  Dress. Cap(headdress) is very cheap.
"Doesn't have any control, the band rolls down, and the top is too high."
This product was very large.
"This product is horrible, it sheds everywhere even after washed and it's gigantic even though I bought my size. I do not recomend this robe."
Watch arrived scratched and dented.
the analog wasn't working when I received it.
Runs extremely wide/large
"Ordered these in ""Navy"" - not at all like the photo.  You can only call them ""Navy"" if you define that as Battleship Gray which is the actual color of the shoe.  Also, this particular style apparently runs larger than any other Clarks.  Had to return them."
Wong size norm a Med ordered a large just in case it's more like a small I guess if you want large you need a 2-3x
"Unless you like itchy yarn around your neck, don't buy this scarf."
I did not like the material of the fabric. It was too small. I returned the item.
Doesn't like the style and materiel
It doesn't so much stay on the head as it isn't deep enough.
"THEY FIT PERFECT AND ARE SO SOFT I LOVE THEM

Edit: I wore them 3 times and the seams are all coming undone. They aren't tight on me and I wash them with delicates. So so disappointed. Taking it from 5 stars to 2."
returned them....too small
"These made me look really short due to stopping right around my ankles. I think I have a very narrow ankle area or something because there was too much space around my ankles, so much so that they look like clogs on me. I am normally a 5.5 and these were a bit tight with socks, perfect without socks.

Looked so cute online, wish it could have worked out"
Uncomfortable and thinner than expected. Feels very cheap. Disappointed
"I have ordered many beautiful clothes for my granddaughter, but this item was very cheaply  made and definitely not the usual.quality I have come to expect from Amazon."
Broke during the first photo shoot not well made. chain around wrist broke
This cape was shorter than I envisioned.  I gave it away as a gift.
"This fits if you have no breasts. If you have something under your shirt, no matter the size, then don't get this bra.  There is WAY too much padding that it pushes you completely out of the bra and doesn't support you whatsoever. On top of that, mine came in a squashed package and the bra is permanently out of shape because of it.  Waste of money."
"I bought them for my teenage son.  He wears socks with holes in them, so he is not picky when it comes to socks.  The feedback with these socks wasn't on the high side."
This def doesn't run small in my experience. The pair I received ran to big. I always wear an 7.5 in high heels and an 8 in any type of sneakers. These I bought an 8 even though it said runs small and they are too big. My foot can completely slip out. These are actually SUPER ugly in person. They look like senior citizen orthopedic shoes just with a small wedge. Looking for fashion and trendy STAY AWAY! I wore them once and stitching is already loose and they scuff super easy. Overall VERY Disappointed!!!
The purple dress fell apart pretty quickly at the seam where the top meets the bottom. Now I'm being forced by a toddler to get my sewing machine out to fix it because she wants to still wear it.
Not as cute as I had expected
I cannot recommend as sizing is a guessing game......
They broke on the third day after receiving them.
"OK I was tricked by the photo!  Gosh a lot of these Halloween costumes are so sneaky.  I thought this was the corset top and the collar/fur piece.  It is ONLY the collar and fur!  Thank GOD I ordered two different style corsets in case one didn't fit, or else I would be up the creek without a paddle!  I know everything doesn't always come in a costume that is shown, but I thought this one was especially tricksy.  Boo. :("
These do not fit well just an honest review.
"Looked cute but it felt narrow and had rough material around the edges, no arch support/padding inside, rubbed at the heel. Cheap quality that might fit some feet better but they uncomfortable overall."
"Having originally placed an order for a similar item (http://www.amazon.com/Flora-Rockabilly-Petticoat-Underskirt-XSmall-Medium/dp/B00GZ1M9P2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1428076587&sr=8-1&keywords=flora+) which was obviously shipping from overseas based on the delivery date window,  I was really excited to find petticoats at this price that were also eligible for Prime, particularly because my initial order for the Flora slip was inexplicably canceled by the seller (bridalmaria). I had previously purchased this petticoat (http://www.amazon.com/DJT-Vintage-Rockabilly-Petticoat-Length/dp/B00KAW5D32/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1428076902&sr=8-1&keywords=djt+petticoat) which I LOVE (see my review there, but suffice it to say that if you're a size 6 or up, you should buy that one!). This time, I ordered 5 slips from Tidetell, and when they arrived, they were packaged identical to the DJT slips, and at first glance, appeared to be constructed of the same materials. That is where the similarity ends.

The Tidetell slips and DJT slips I ordered were listed as the same size (S/M), however the Tidetell slips, when laid flat for comparison, range from approximately 1.5"" smaller in the waistband to about 4"" smaller where the spandex top meets the first layer of organza. When you compare both items online, as I did prior to purchase, they appear to be the same: spandex top, triple-tiered organza, polyester underskirt, however in addition to the size discrepancy, the elastic waist in the Tidetell slip is far less stretchy and forgiving. I'd say the Tidetell slip won't fit anyone larger than a size 4, and even that may be a stretch (pardon the pun). At a size 10/12, this slip was actually painful to wear. Ladies who are extremely petite: this slip will work for you, and the price can't be beat! Anyone size 6 and up, spend the extra money and order the DJT slip if you're in a pinch and need it quickly like I was. Both items were Prime eligible as of this review, and to be fair, I haven't tried the L/XL from Tidetell (it was double the price when I ordered). However, I find the DJT to be a better construction--softer fabrics, stretchier elastic, better overall cut."
"The reviews were right, one of the sleeves was longer than the other. Not to noticeable however."
"Worst underwear ever.  These are ill-fitting, fits like bikinis not boy shorts.  Fits way to low on hips.  Very thin, stretched out and doesn't appear to have much cotton content. Wish I could return but wore half expecting better results. Would never purchase these again."
I wear a 12.5-13 so ordered the XL per the sizing guidelines. Way too big. Too much of a hassle to ship back.
"Admittedly, I'm accustomed to Fruit-O' fit but have a few Hanes ""most comfortable..."" around as well, they are all sized 'Large' and fit well but these, even after washing several times, were very baggy, not like-to-my-knees baggy but hanging well off-my-rear-bumper baggy, also I am disabled so my thighs are fairly small in girth but still the leg banding was very tight. I guess I thought that Hanes would have one standard 'Large' size but apparently not. I'll not purchase 'red label' again, sorry Hanes."
These slippers cut into the top part of my foot and yet were too big for my feet.  No quality at all.  Returned them right away.
"The velcro strap was too high up and cuts into the top of the foot even when you loosen the velcro...so disappointed.  Since I've thrown the box away, I don't think I can return it to amazon.com...feeling sad."
"WAY TO BIG!! I won't even be able to wear them. Seem comfortable, but waste of money. Im done ordering on amazon from now on."
Don't buy these if your feet are normal-wide these are only for people with narrow feet.  Also if you have any plantar fascitis problems they will make your heels hurt worse.
Its really cute and was exactly was I was looking for . however unless you have no boobs they won't fit into this bathing suit. I am not plus size orders largest size xxxl fits everywhere but the top
This hurt my feet so BAD!! Terrible!!
"Meh, more like a mumu."
"Runs small, and the flap crossover on the chest area is not sewn down so it flops all over. Also it is really just a dark purple, not a berry color and it is a thin knit. It also runs long and went well over my knees."
"Skimpy, and made for a small body."
"I have purchased Rockport shoes for years. For me price is not the object but I have had trouble for recently attempting to purchase shoes with width and support from anywhere. These are an example of my search. I have orthopedic inserts so support shouldn't be an object but even if the size wasn't exactly right, there should be some support. None. I felt like I was walking on bricks. I actually had to look twice to make sure they said ""Rockport"" on the box."
Runs much smaller than shoe size.
"Very dark looking metal, that i question it's authenticity to be stainless.. they sit very high off of the surface of the earlobe, and the post is so long that i find them sometimes hanging out and down from the ear, with the post showing... i imagine they go down due to the weight of the earring, itself. I just don't get the feeling they are stainless, even though they are reported to be, and they actually made one of my ears turn reddish... So i took them out and put some of my old earrings in."
Turning a bronze color and leaves my wrist gray
really small.  ended up returning it.
"Nice shirt when new, but it shrinks after washing. Very annoying."
"t-shirt is very thin to the point of being see through, and the cut outs are just cut outs like will fray with time... the shirt is oober tiny the pic looks like it's supposed to fit a little loosely, but she must be a size small model wearing a size Xl shirt for it to be loose, ordering your on size is going to get you a skintight top."
Smells TERRIBLE!  I kept this out in fresh air for over 2 weeks and the wallet still smelled so bad of chemicals.  Bought this for my husband for his birthday and he did not like it so I returned it.  It was too big for his pocket and the smell was unbearable!
Did not fit my foot well.  Hard shoe and not very comfortable.  Had to return it to keep from wasting money.
"My eighth PattyBoutik purchase and my first return.  I have really loved my PattyBoutik items, they are slim enough in the waist that I do not have to alter them and the quality has been excellent for the price.  This dress might be good for some but not for me. I wear a small, I am 5'3"", usually a size 2 or 4 and I have an hour glass figure.
Cons
Too tight in the bust and around the arm holes, too loose in the waist, and MUCH too tight at the hem. It was like trying to walk with a resistance band around my knees! Add to this material I found odd. The material did not have much stretch, just okay slightly nubby texture with a bit of sparkle. my conclusion, not for me.
Pros
Heavy weight material, dressier look and definitely not see through.  Basically a very, very pretty design.
It just was not right for me but might be wonderful for someone else."
"Very cheaply made.  It came with unfinished seams and hems undone.  It might be OK in cool weather, but in warm or hot weather it is very uncomfortable."
They are quite uncomfortable. True to size though and a bit narrow.
"Fits great but looks like an old worn out shirt!
I was expecting nautical quality, which is obviously lacking. Has to go back."
"All's I can say is that this did not hold me up very much!  maybe a half an inch.  And that's not saying much because I am a B cup.  I bought this to go under my clothing I didn't want to wear a bra with (tube top) and bathing suit.  I've had a breast lift/reduction, so that's not the issue, it was just so it didn't look as though I didn't have a bra on.  Basically it just helped them not sway!  The adhesive wasn't bad though and didn't hurt to take off."
Nice look but very cheap material. Only got a couple of wears out of them before they started peeling. Save your money
This looks like it should be a loose fit but it is very very tight.
"Ive been using cheap wrap around style amber lenses in the cockpit for the past few years and they work pretty well. I decided to fork over a little more money for these, and I just don't care for them. They are flat across the eyes which leave the sides wide open causing glare from behind. The grey lenses are decent for bright days, especially up in the flight levels. As soon as you get under partly cloudy sky, everything is too dark, especially the cockpit. They don't seem to offer any haze penetration either. In the first week I got big scratch on them. Other than that, the construction feels decent and the flat ear pieces fit well under the headset."
"I have owned many waist trainers/vests, but this was the worst one I have ever bought. All of mine were always latex, but the latex never gave me issues.. When I received this one, there was literally latex powder coming off of it onto my skin and clothes. Had to get rid of my favorite black shirt because I could not get rid of the white powder that was all over it and it caused my skin to swell and itch. Very poorly made."
"I ordered these in both the 7.5 and 7W. The 7.5's fit great in the foot area. Perfect space for my toes and ankles, not too tight and not too loose. The shaft of the boot was the problem. Like other reviewers, I could barely get the boot to zip. I didn't think that I would have a problem with this since I am a smaller woman (5'3"", size 4-6 dress) but they are extremely tight. It was so disappointing as I have been wanting these boots for months and I finally had the budget to purchase them. I ordered the 7W's thinking that the shaft would be better but it was not. It was slightly less tight but the bunchiness around the ankle was hideous. The shaft size and foot size definitely do not match up. I decided to keep the 7.5's after trying them on with tights since that is how I will be wearing them this fall/winter. The tights seemed to help the boots zip more easily and I'm hoping that they will stretch a little with wear."
too small and very clingy - the picture looks like it should drape in soft folds
WAY TO SMALL people with thick hair don't buy
I had high hopes for the shoes since they weight nothing in your backpack. Strap broke after 2nd wear.
"Love the look, but don't like the ride.  A little harsh, especially in the toe zone.  Very good laces and closure.  They never untie."
"This scarf is pretty and its soft, but its also very cheaply made. Ive worn it just once since I got it , and one side edge is already unraveling. Looking at the edges closely,  there is nothing to keep any edge from unraveling in the future! And it sheds all over my sweaters and coats!"
not what I was exspecting
"This ring is very beautiful, don't get me wrong, BUT it does look fake. It's too big, but that's not the real problem..... the inside is made so very cheep that it scratches my wife's finger. It turn's her finger red from being irritated non-stop. Like i sais it's very beautiful to look at and if that's all you were doing with it i would give it 5 star's, but if you plan to ever actually wear it, you better have really good health insurance, and alot of band aids, LOL"
"This dress is perfect if you're pregnant.  This dress is obviously made for pregnancy as the front is at least two whole inches longer than the back.  Washing didn't help, it was made this way."
"Dress is very thin and just hangs like a limp rag.  Constructed in a way that makes me look like a big fat pumpkin!  Gave it away to the Salvation Army!  I do not recommend anyone purchase this dress, despite the great look in the photo!"
"Strange fit in the toe area on the left shoe and the right shoe was way too big for the size ordered.  I noticed the toe on the right shoe was more oval and the left shoe more rounded.  When I ordered a half size smaller, they were too small.  Sending both pairs back and will try another more consistent brand."
Ive got a few pairs of chacos in a different style and his one particular style was the least comfortable of them all and my foot is already small and narrow with a high arch. I prefer the z/volv x2 style
"See through material. Super light/weak material. If your know anyone with a sewing machine, pick up some decent material at a local store and have them make something better than this, which they surely can do in 5 minutes. $18 wasted on a rag. I don't take pleasure in writing a bad review and this happens to be my first bad review but this is a rip off."
unlike expected
"Pros: Lightweight and the display is bright enough in sunlight.

Cons: The display isn't always on and you have to press an incredibly narrow button with a fair amount of force to get the time. If you are weight training be aware that to adjust the straps you need to CUT the bands down to size. The lock that holds the watch in place is VERY flimsy and will come undone easily. The only thing holding it in place is a small magnet and 4 pins that don't actually lock into place. There was also some leftover plastic on the side that wasn't trimmed properly and was sharp enough to cut my wrist.

2 stars solely because it looks nice."
Never got to wear it way too small. Maybe when I lose weight for 2017. Too lazy to return it.
So disappointed. This was so small. Order 2-3 sizes up
"As a woman, I tend to wear a lot of my husband's pajama pants, so I figured I would just order my own.  These were not the PJs I was looking for.  They were WAY to tight in the butt and hips and way to baggy in the crotch.  This may be a comfortable fit for men; I don't know.  I know these felt absolutely wrong on me."
Cute. But 24 months didn't ft my 22 month old
"to long. no way they were a 30"" lgth"
I can not wear these way way too large! I think they are sized wrong
The boots were too small in length and width; had hoped to exchange for a 13W but none available.  Ended up returning for refund and purchased a pair of Keen-they fit perfectly and were good to go right out of the box.
The top part was way too big for me and couldn't tighten the straps enough to compensate for it. The length was good. Unfortunately the underwear that came with it was too big too.
Very thin material and runs smaller than the Hanes which is a bette product!
"The colour is not teal, it's green, nice green but not teal. The material I find to be very thin and more like a light jersey material. It's an Ok dress."
The white shirt is see-through. Was hoping it wasn't but it is.. have to return it
"I won't be wearing this, because the top band immediately rolls down to my waist, creating an even more unsightly bulge than the one I'm trying to tame with a support undergarment."
"The sizes do not seem to be consistent at all.  I purchase a large a while ago which fit perfectly and was thrilled because my foot size is difficult to find and these were very comfortable.  Then, after a repeat order, I could immediately see that they were much larger just by looking at them without unwrapping.  These were returned to exchange for a pack of medium expecting them to be somewhere between large and small.  The mediums I received were too small, so small in fact that a small would not have been the correct scale to the large, medium, small.  Unfortunately, I unpackaged them to see if they could be stretched to fit and could not be returned.  Also, while some of the mediums almost fit, others were smaller.  If I can't find another brand to my liking, I guess I'll have to try the large again to wash a few times and hope they shrink."
I ordered a size up and still couldn't get my foot into them. WAY TOO SMALL!!!
"the large was way way too big for a 5'9"" tall, 17-1/2 34/35 shirt cut, 34 waist guy.  the thing was like a nightgown.  gave it away.  material was kinda cool though"
"BROKEN LATCH,"
"Beautiful - but the finish was wearing off after wearing it only twice under normal circumstances (worn as dress watch - I'm not rough on them or using it in an active lifestyle)  I will be returning this.  This is too much money for the finish to look like this already. I was disappointed as I thought it was a gorgeous watch!

I received return authorization from ""WatchSavings"" immediately upon notifying them of the damage to watch.  I received an acknowledgement of the return being received over a month ago - since then I have received no responses from them - processing return?  Refund?  Repair?  They are not responding to emails!  Amazon is not standing by my claim stating that is considered ""wear and tear"" - unbelievable!  Second time wearing it and the finish is worn through so that it looks terrible!  I would never have paid this much money for such a poorly made watch - who would pay for a watch to fall apart immediately?  Who would expect Amazon to not stand by the customer? I have never had such a bad experience from Amazon as this and never thought I would."
Way to small. Got a 2xl so I knew it would fit and it's more like a medium
These appear to be a near-functional copy of this shoe: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B017YTKTLY/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 except that on this copy the insole is not adhered to the inside of the shoe. As a result when you remove the shoe the insole sticks to your foot and comes out with it. They are almost the same price so I'd by the Aleader product and pass on this one if I were you.
This shoe runs at least 1 1/2 sizes too big
Ehh to small didn't fit right.
i own sketchers and this pair did not fit at all.  too small.  need to return
"I wanted to love this top, it looks so cute in the picture. But the armholes were too big, it fit slightly tight through the chest, and the stitching wasn't as nice as I expected. I'm returning!"
"Okay, I'll start off by saying they're soft and fit well. Now, as to wearing them and walking in them for any length of time... NO!

Quiksilver, I'm sorry but these are horrible flip flops.  I live in San Diego, CA and wear flip-flops pretty much all day, every day and all of mine are Quiksilver brand.  The texture they designed into the top of the shoe (like little cut-out diamond shapes) will tear your feet up.  I had these things on for three hours during a local brew festival (lot of stand, but very slow pace) and at the end my feet felt like I had been walking barefoot on a gravel road. I decided to give these another chance and took these thing with me on a vacation.  After a few hours of walking around the sites, I literally had blisters on the bottoms of both feet (just back from the toes, middle upper foot pad).  I mean seriously, how do you get blisters on the bottom of your feet from flip flops??  Horrible shoes, I can't say enough to warn you away from these.  Find another pair of Quiksilver's, these are no bueno!"
is  poor quality..the color received is not the same
"I think it's a great sandal, but the straps hit my feet in weird places."
The bathing suit looks nothing at all like what is pictured. Very very small. The top is cery cheaply made and I would be worried about it breaking if I wore it out. Do not buy this suit
"It was nothing that I expected, cheap box and a paper poem but then you do get what you pay for."
"I really didn't like them sorry to tell u that , but the pic for this product shows the sunglasses more Stately than it in the real"
These jeans run smaller than the size stated.  In addition they are too 'see-thru' for white jeans.  I do not recommend them.
I read the reviews and I ordered a smaller size and it was still too large.
"Very cheap.  Poor quality. Fell apart as I pulled it out of the plastic wrap.
Not worth it.  I ended up having to go to a local costume store to buy another one that didn't fall apart."
"This top is just not up to the standards I associate with this brand.  It was lopsided, has an odd flap in the back, and simply isn't flattering.  My husband told me I looked like I gained 10lbs.  Enough said -- I sent it back."
These leggings are cute but are just to small for a adult I gave them to my 12 and 10 year old daughters and they love them
"Nice fabric, smooth and seamless, long to allow full coverage even when bending over  but very form fitting.  I did want a smooth sleek look BUT I feel like I am wearing Spanxs! I would order your size if you don't mind every detail shown, but I think it best to go a size up.  M/L more like an 8 not 10/12."
"I returned this purse because the gun compartment is on the inside of the purse squished against you body, which made it difficult for me to reach and pull out my gun. Also this purse in not real leather and is made in China, the quality just wasn't there. Don't buy."
"I returned these shoes.  They are great-looking, but the strap that adjusts does not make them fit better. I usually like Hi-Tec shoes, but not these. The adjustable strap meets another strap at a ""T"" and does not adjust the shoe to fit.  The other strap that goes all the way across your foot needs to be the one that adjusts."
Had potential but I felt like I was wearing a curtain. The under lining was more yellow hued than nude. No complainta about the seller. Shipped and arrived fast.
"The material was very nice. The color was just as expected. But the the way it was made, was disproportionate. I have a large bottom but a small waist. And normally I can fit into a size 14 Rekucci pant. But this one came up short on the back side. This was puzzling since I fit in this brand of clothes. So perhaps it was just this pant. I will try ordering another one in the future. Disappointing."
"Tarnished within less then a week, a lifetime guarantee is useless when they tarnish in less then a week."
Ordered 2 sets of these charms & never received a thing.  Good way for someone to collect a dab of money & not provide a thing & still be advertising for more free money!
"I loved these shoes when I wore them for a few times. But then the sole started to fall apart. Also, the sole gets very soggy during rainy weather. I am not happy with them at all."
"These gloves have a very odd fit, so that the main selling point of the glove is defective, which is to be able to use your phone."
Fit on this shirt was not loose as I expected and the photo shows.  I will not wear it.
Plastic soles. Horrible
The clothes came out too small.
"I ordered this shirt in while/navy, since it is listed as being 100% cotton and I'm allergic to poly-cotton blends.  I was very disappointed to see that the shirt is not all cotton as describes and have sent it back to Amazon."
"I was a little disappointed with this shirt. The picture shown is clearly of a size Small shirt. I bought size XXXL as it was for a larger person but the santa beard and belt graphic on the front was the same size as what I assume they print on size S. So it was just a small little graphic on the front of this very large shirt, which looked stupid, especially since there's a belt on there which ended up just being a buckle and a tiny piece of the belt strap on either side of it and then it ends abruptly. The shirt itself was thick, heavy cotton - no issues there. But if you're buying a larger size, be aware of the tiny graphic issue.."
Bottom came off a shoe.
Other panties in the same size fit me perfectly. These feel a little tight and I'm worried about tearing the lace when I put them on. They are very pretty.  UPDATE - the lace pretty much shredded after a couple washes. I thought I'd try the larger size but they are huge on me (and of course you have to open them to find out so I'm stuck with them). I think the first ones were probably the correct size but they are simply too flimsy.
"HATE these sandal's! I will not even ware them to take the trash out.  I have Plantars Faciitis and was hoping this would help cushion my heal but they feel like hard plastic, horrible, horrible."
Never wore it.  Fabric is cheap.
"Suit appears to be a long as it is about 3 inches too long.  If placed at bust, crotch hangs down 3 inches.  I placed at crotch bust is under my chin.  Ordered 4 of these type of suits in different colors this year and only one of them was the expected length."
"I just received these studs today, I was very exited about opening the box, I was expecting to find a simple but beautiful earnings but my disappointment was too much when I found they hadn't the regular pinkish tone of freshwater pearls, they're almost yellow!!. The backs are very loose and poor quality. At least they weren't so expensive."
"These are not what Lucky jeans used to be. Their very thin by comparison. The pockets are not deep and even have different material...little blue clovers instead of the big red ones. I've had several 181s and these don't fit the same. They're too long and a little snug around the thighs. Don't know if they're a knock off or if Lucky jeans sold out but I don't recommend. Especially, if you're used to the original Luckys."
"You don't get the colors they show here. They are all designed wrong and stitched badly. When you try to put them on, the top piece of lace curls under. I had to trim pieces of under material from the front. They used second grade fabric on the crotches, so some of them have yellow fabric on the crotches that you can see to the front."
"I usually wear a 9 to 9  depending on the sneaker.  This is a nice light=weight shoe but the width was entirely too wide.  The length of the shoe fit properly, but I could see myself getting blisters because my foot kept coming out of the shoe when I walked.  I ordered a 9  M, which is a regular width and which I usually wear.  I wanted to order a more narrow width, then just got irritated that the price went UP for a more narrow width, so just decided to chuck the whole Propet Brand idea."
"The fit is fine... it's the color that disappointed me.
I ordered this SPECIFIC pair because of the washed out color... It says ""light"" stonewash and that is what I wanted. But what arrived was the regular stone-washed color; you know, slightly faded but not the ""light"" stonewash I wanted and they picture here. There were quite a few variations of stonewash to choose from, but I'm unhappy with this purchase as I already had a pair of the regular stonewash and was looking forward to something different. It says in the script of the product ""no control over color"", or ""colors will vary""... but if that's the case then just eliminate this ""light"" color and go with the regular that you are shipping!
I'm unhappy!"
"Fine for a cheap pair, comes with a wax mold that forms to your teeth. Didn't corm comfortably to my teeth and they silver drove into my gums. Used these for joker cosplay, look like cheap knock-offs for the Leto Joker."
"Do not buy this boot unless you like the look and feel of really cheap leather. The style and color are great, but the quality is poor. I hate the hassle of returning, so I've kept the boots and wear them every now and then. I have really slim legs and barely there calves...it was tight from the ankle up. I read the reviews, but still bought them anyway...next time I will be more careful!"
"They are good for bikers, not fasionable."
Im a 34D and when I put this bra on I felt like it made them a weird shape... almost pointy and far apart. I disliked it even more when I put a shirt on over it.
These are the worst keen shoes i have ever had.
"Where do I begin....  I bought it as part of my work attire.  I am a short woman, 5' 3"", and the shirt was way too short to tuck the tails in.  The material is absolutely cheap and ultra see-through.  It had the feel and appearance of a rough handkerchief.  This shirt should not cost half of what it is priced at.  Sending it back."
"Quality is good, but runs smalls.. definitely recommend sizing up. 2T clothes is big on my daughter for reference she is 24 lbs and 34 inches tall. This 2T training pants fit her so tight. It would be a struggle to pull down. We also ordered the Gerber brand in size 2T as well and that sizing was more TTS and was much softer. Would not recomm day this item."
"Sorry, this suit was way too large for the normal size I wear. I had to send it back."
Well thought out pack. Downfall... made with very thin material. Have an older version of this one and its WAY more heavy duty. Also pack was shipped without shoulder strap. Had it been included I would have kept it. (Yes I checked every compartment looking for it)
We live in California where it never rains. My son probably wore these about 6 times total and the outer shell is cracked and split in several places at the seams so water leaks through. Highly disappointed that these will now end up in a landfill and cant be used for the whole season or handed down to his brother. Very wasteful.
"Fabric was comfortable, but too thin to hide a nude-colored bra. Even knowing that the tye-dye I received would be different than the picture, the shirt I wound up with was colored very oddly. There was a big blue blotch right over my stomach, rather than the vague line/stripe pattern pictured."
the writing on the insole wore out in a week
"This bag is super cute and I love the color and would give it a five star rating if it was marketed as a girls sleepover bag. That is what I am going to use it for, actually my tween cousin will use it for that and look  stylish beyond her years. I was looking for a travel bag and tend to pack heavy. This bag is large but not built for heavy use. The plastic adjusters on the straps are impossibly cheap, even for plastic. If looking cool is your motive to buy this bag the price is more than fair. If you are looking for quality and a bag built to last this one is not it."
Came ripped
"So disappointed with asics.  Second pair, differences styles, that I ordered...I wth both being too smalll.  These especially were too short and have no give in the toe as there is a hard plastic piece to protect front of toe box.  They are going back."
cheap looking and small good for a young girl
"These shoes are very ugly, way to big and not made worth a crap. The colored hearts on the side of the shoe are half way fadding away and my daughter has not even wore them. They were like that when I received them. Do not buy these shoes. Totally not worth the money. My honest opinion they need to discontinue these shoes forever. Very unhappy!!!"
"I did not like these gloves at all.
Please don't waste your Money."
Received the correct item on the delivery date. My Nike slides were a size 11 these were marked as size 11 but were much smaller. If you buy them get two sizes bigger than what you normally wear
"The two tops are cute and look like the picture for the most part but I am 5 feet tall, it would probably be way too short on anyone over 5'4"". The leopard print tank top is cute, but the edges are raw (just cut with no seam to keep them from unraveling). The biggest issue is the stretchy lace. I washed it on cool and did not put it in the dryer and the lace is already starting to fray."
It was super tight and very see through....
I had to throw them away. They're HUUUUUUGE.
Ordered 2 sizes bigger than i normally wear and it's still too small can't return so if you buy beware you will be stuck with this item
Runs 1 size small. Im a 6.5 got a 7 and its so tight had to get a 7.5. Still tight.. i just returned both. Too bad nice shoe
"It did not fit around drain, to small. And did not stay in one place"
"These fit well on my 10 mo old son but that is about it. Very poor quality - one pair had so many pills (yarn balls) from just washing it one time (standard cold water cycle and no dryer) before using it that it I decided to return the lot of them. However, I did try on a few other pairs, they all seemed distressed after one wear; he walked around on smooth hard wood floors and carpet."
Don't waist your money on these CHEAP China made shoes!
"Not what I thought at all, thighs are too loose. good material though, it might be just that I don't look good in boot cut jean"
"I wanted to love this so much, unfortunately I did not. The bottoms seemed to be very well made, but the top was so cheap looking. I also should have sized up from a small to a medium, but after reading the reviews I figured a small would be good and I was wrong. I have a TINY TINY butt, and still this suit was too tight through the thigh and butt. I also have a really long torso, so the waist of the bottoms hit at the wrong angle. So bummed. :("
"While these had a nice look, it was impossible to wedge my foot into them given the design. I normally wear a size 8, given other comments ordered an 8.5, and still could not get the boot on my foot. These will be going back and I will try another style..."
"Order as big as you can, or better yet... buy from someone else"
"The top has an underwire which I thought would be supportive. Instead, the cups are pointy and laughable. Not a good look at all! I am a 40 C so this should have fit according to the size chart!
The bottom was too small and I usually wear size 18 or so in pants not a 4 X!!! The leg holes painfully tight. No more suits made in China for me!"
Quality ok but i guess as inners it doesnt matter. Would not buy it again.
"I am giving these one star because they leak. They have the two tone lowers and stitching holds the two types of material together. They failed to add glue to the seam and when you walk in snow or slush as you step the toe leaks water. This happened the first time I wore them so back in the box they go and back to Amazon. Very disappointed in Totes. Second time they let me down. Never again. I'm anti-Totes now!
This is an update to my initial post. I originally gave them 4 stars because while wider than a B they aren't that wide. Hadn't had any snow yet."
"I am trying to stretch the straps because they are tight across my food.  Normally, Clark's shoes fit great, but these are very narrow.  They are a well made shoe and the pewter is a pretty color."
"I ordered the ""hobo"" bag and received another style. The style sent to me was okay but it was not the hobo bag. Because of this I will never order another purse from Amazon. I may only stick with books and games now. I am very disappointed."
"The picture clearly shows St. Michael and you can even read the words surrounding the image well.  In person, this is not the case.  I can hardly make out the image of St. Michael.  I can read no words well either.  It's lovely upon first glance, all shiny and new, but if you can't see what is on the medal, what value does it have?  None."
"The neck is sharp! It hurts & the color is not hunter green as pictured, it's like a Teal green. I might try to save it & have my mom make me a neck that doesn't hurt. ( & I'm petite, - 5""3 120ish- I have a pretty small neck circumference & its still tight) Also, the material bunches up at the top where it crosses, it doesn't lie flat. I might return it, not super satisfied with this but the concept is very pretty."
"Okay, now I will explain the headline.  A year ago I ordered these to be sent to my vacation house when I was shut in during a bitterly cold winter.  They were thick, perfect-sized and very comfortable, even after wearing them for a few days with no shower.  (I know, gross, but that is what happens in the Northwoods, get over it.)  So when I accidentally sliced open my favorite sweat pants back home in SoCal, I didn't hesitate and went straight to the Amazon app on my phone and ordered another pair while at a red light.  And when they showed, they are so misshaped and out of proportion they are useless.  The legs of these things are literally 7 inches longer than ANY other pair of large sweats I have from ANY other manufacturer.  I am thinking about sewing the cuffs closed and using them as footies.  But for normal wear, they are literally useless, and it would cost me $6.80 to return them.  So this was a completely wasted purchase.  Now I will drive around Hollywood looking for a homeless 34"" waist but 6'10"" person to give them away to in hopes that SOMEONE SOMEWHERE will get some use out of them.  It just won't be me.  And hopefully won't be you either.  But if you are a 24"" waist and 6'10"" homeless person, drop me a line and I will give them to you."
"It doesn't look anything like the picture, has a few small heart cutouts but more circles or odd shapes and it's not round more oval... very disappointed"
Don't waste your money.. Poor quality very thin material. Not hem at the bottom of the dress. Chest cut too deep. Not for a woman with large bust. Just don't buy. Put your money in the gas tank!
"not very appealing in bust area, cheap feeling material. such a shame because it looks beautiful - design wise"
"made the mistake of getting a brown pair of these a year ago, and found an acceptably inexpensive boot with however rotten quality control...the stitched design on the front of the boot was facing off in a 55 degree direction instead of 90 degrees perpindicular, and was additionally off to one side. remarkable.

i decided this week to try the black leather version hoping this would turn out different but instead it was worse. this time one boot was smooth leather, the other boot had the pattern you see in the photo. PLUS the smooth boot had a pointed round toe, while the other boot had a big huge full round toe on it, like twice as big.

back for refund, but what a hassle. i'd stay away from justin boots that are made in china, which means most if not all under $175 or so. if made to design, these would be wonderful boots, but because of rotten/NO quality control you get things like 2 different style boots when you order these (both idiotically marked with the same style number) or other weird things like toe stitched insignia looking like a postage stamp put on the wrong way."
"I don't know if I didn't read the description thoroughly enough but I was expecting a more modest lift. I'm a B cup and like a gentle ""push"" but this bra is heavily padded and makes my boobs look obviously fake. I will not wear it."
"Hate this bra!  The straps are set too far to the side and they roll on the shoulder.  The material on the cup wrinkles even though the bra fits.  Total waste of money.  Of course, I wore it once, so I cannot return it.
Don't buy this bra.  I am a 44D size."
"I've worn 2X for years, these were WAY too tight, I couldn't even get it on"
"I've ordered size 6,5 W that usually fits perfectly , but this pair of shoes fits like 6,5 N.
I'll return it..."
"Wore them 2 times and ended up with 2 seams splitting. I use a snow thrower, and it does the heavy work"
"First, the true colors are best represented in the last picture. The romper on the model is a lot lighter compared to the thing in person. I ordered a size medium and definitely fits like a small. I'm 5'8 and 130 lbs with stick-like legs and the bottom of the romper was very form fitting to my thighs, not loose in the picture. Overall, I do like it especially for the price."
"Well ... where do I begin?  I ordered a total of 3 pairs when I ordered this white sandal wedgie shoe: black, tan and white.  The other two pairs had the NECESSARY ELASTIC on the straps so they could expand over your heel to fit.  THE WHITE SANDAL WEDGIE DID NOT.  In addition, the shoe runs small, so there was no way it would fit my size.  The the black and tan sandals fit fine.  To summarize, the price is so low and the shoe so poorly and cheaply made, you truly  'get what you pay for',  which in this instance, is NOTHING."
"I'm 6'1"", 205lbs with a muscular build and the medium in this is too big and squared off. The stretch is nice but the Luxe model of these scrubs fit so much better and stretch a lot more. The material on the Luxe is much more pleasant too. This scrub top hangs off of my back in an odd and uncomfortable way. There is a lot of material left over in the mid section so if you have a bigger stomach these may fit you better. Overall if you're anywhere close to my size then just spend the extra 7 dollars and get the Luxe. You won't regret it at all."
I was looking for an everyday sandal and these did not fit the bill.  I expected the cutout pattern to be more of organic shape but it was quite unattractive.  Overall the proportions of this sandal were not flattering on the foot.  I will be returning these.
Sole is not resolable as well as profoundly uncomfortable. It is also made from cheap genuine leather and not full grain like all serious boots.
The left boot was medium width....the right boot was wide width. The laces feel like there gunna brake every time i tie them. They have styrofoam soles and i slip all over the place. My back is killing me and im sueing caterpiller
"Not as pictured.  Gloves did not have individual fingers.  They do the job, though."
"This dress did not look anything like the description/picture.  From what I can tell,  it is not a licensed ""Disney"" dress.  The label states it is a ""Vogue fashion"".  It did not come with a tiara as the description stated.  The dress is pretty but it is NOT what I ordered.  I am returning it today."
too big. ugly. wish I hadn't bought it
"Towels came pretty fast, although the quality is not really good, the towels fade and the threads are coming off. You get what you pay for."
"It turns out these are cotton but the crotch is polyester!!!!  Exactly what you don't want. I noticed insert fabric was pilling, so checked one pair by the fire test---held them over gas flame on the stove----the crotch insert melted like plastic.  False advertising, I should get a refund even after this time; certainly won't wear them again.  Too bad, they are great otherwise."
"This belt was much cheaper quality than I expected.  It's OK.  The color is kind of weird, so I haven't worn it."
"Both bra straps broke within 2 months of buying it, the stitching gave way.  It was comfortable until that happened.  The worst bra I've ever gotten from MC and I have a couple that I actually love and still use."
"It's for SHORT women!  I'm 5'10 so the slit opening starts at my belly button.  The bottom of the piece that should fall at my thighs falls right at my butt.  It's probably great if you're puny, but if you're tall, save your money."
Wouldn't lay straight. Kept twisting all night.
It definitely isn't something for thick women
"Washed it once, got a hole in the front. Cheap piece of junk I guess. Wolves cannot go in the washing machine."
"I really needed shoes for work and loved the idea of these, but they are waaaay too big. I can't walk in them at all even with extremely thick socks. I have no idea how many sizes to go down to get the right size so it is very frustrating."
Very small for price
VERY CHEAPLY MADE - I returned it and only got about 1/2 back
"I wore Levis back when they were an American made quality product.  When they offshored, I jettisoned my biz and am currently buying Unionline.  Well, I was curious after these many years what had become of Levis - this once iconic American brand. I ordered a pair of 501s only to find what I had anticipated: build quality was crap (the stitching looks like third graders did it with a knitting needle (actually, that's probably not far from the truth)), material was thin and reminded me of the cheapos that typically end up on clearance racks), the fit after one wash was absurd. One leg tighter and shorter than the other? Seriously?

Levis - I left you years ago - and for good reason; your product is absolute, unmitigated crap."
"hard cardboard, that's how I would describe these shoes."
There is absolutely no arch support in these shoes.  I wore them one afternoon of casual walking and just about crippled my feet.  I am returning the shoes for full credit.  Rockport's quality has really gone down.
"Wayyy too small. Size chart is way off. The back also isn't as open as it is in the picture, the black part starts about halfway up your back, not at the small of your back. It's made of a cheap, stretchy, very unflattering material, and it came full of snags already. I returned the next day. Don't waste your time or money on this dress!"
"THIS BOOT WAS NOT UP TO EXPECTATIONS.  SIZE DID NOT FIT.  USED TO BE MADE IN THE GOOD OLE USA, NOW MADE IN CHINA"
Didn't care for this bra at all. It fit weird and made my chest look misshapen. Would not recommend.
Material snags very easily.  I only wore this shirt once and it shows 3 snags.
"A star for the soft material and a star for the lovely purple plaid. Sigh. I should know better than to try this adorable style. It is always too tight across the chest (currently 40in. in a maternity bra), the sleeves are too short (I'm 5' 9""), there's no give in the shoulders, and the waist is too baggy. Two sizes up was the right chest measurement, if there was any give in the cut. One size up would have been plenty for the waist. There is just no hope for those sleeves, though. Why. There are long-armed people in the world, too, ya know."
"I ordered a 9B but what I received felt like a mis-marked 9N. I often buy a 9N, but since most shoes do not have sufficient arch support, I've started buying 9B for closed shoes to hold a better arch support insert, which has worked well so far.
Altho' I read the reviews saying that these sneakers ran narrow, the ones I received were ridiculously narrow. I doubt that my usual arch support would even fit into a 9 Wide! So do beware if you buy a pair!
Thank you for making this return free of charge, Amazon!!!"
"I like the material, but it's no where near long enough. I was going to send it back but my sister wanted it for her daughter."
"This is wallet and not a clutch by any stretch of inmaginarion. It is so small, it didn't fit an iPhone 6s with case and my lipstick. It fits money and a phone just like a traditional wallet, nothing else."
"I ordered an extra wide and these were not extra wide, they were returned."
"I'm 5'7"" and 138lbs. Ordered a small and it looks huge and frumpy.  Not at all a nice dressy shirt I had expected. If you're a bigger lady that wants to cover everything up, this might be for you, but it doesn't flatter a mom just trying to hide a baby tummy. Looks ridicules on me."
"nice looking shoe but not made for the wider foot....must be the most uncomfortable shoe that i have paid 100 dollars fot...if you have narrow feet, you might haver better luck...they are sitting in my closet right now after one wearing....thats too bad"
It's very big.  Very disappointed
the shoes are cute but the black on the sole rubs off on my feet and by the time i take them off my feet look dyed black
"The first time I put it on a jewel fell off.  The second time I put it on, another jewel fell off.  Don't waste your money.  It can't even stay together to put it on, let alone wear it."
NOT TRUE TO SIZE AT ALL!
"These lasted about 3 days before they began to tear on the inside at the ball of the foot.
The inside fabric just came apart after about 3 times of wearing them around the house.
I would make a joke about toe nails, but it's under the toes that are the problem... so the joke doesn't check out.
You may think that this is an exaggeration, but surprisingly it's not."
Too small and didn't fit.
"It's not even 7 on Halloween night.  I've been walking around for less than an hour with the horns on like I'm balancing a book on my head, and for nothing.  The plastic broke and now I have no way to attach the heavy things to my head, and the tip of the horn broke even though it landed on my carpeted floor.  Super heavy, elastic won't work for this.  I do not recommend this item.  I knew for the price it was too good to be true and you get what you pay for."
I should have read the reviews closer. As the reviews stated the socks Do NOT COVER YOUR KNEE  unless your shoe size is 6 -7. If  you have very very small feet they will fit. But you If you dont. The want decoration lace top is missed placed on the leg. Ill probably return those or give them a ride Ill give them away.
"The fit is nice, but these shirts are completely see through. They also shrunk and somehow the material bunched to the side after the first wash and air drying, so the ""V"" section is now more towards my hip."
Returning all of them. Were too small. Breasts were not fully cupped.
"badly made don't buy, broke after i got it and made me smell like penny's"
too small in some places baggy in others. i gave it to goodwill as i have found trying to return things to some of these aisan sellers is a complete nightmare and not worth the hassle. however it did come much faster then i had expected
"I'm very disappointed and will be returning the shirt. The transfer is not whole it has skips and missing places. This happens when transfer is not hot enough so when transfer paper is removed some of the color remains on the paper. This is so clearly not done correctly I would have to call it a second. The shirt itself is heavy cotton and looks to be good quality. I also got a ""First Mate"" shirt by same company that has the exact same problem. I'm so glad I opened the bag as it was folded onto itself so you could not see the transfer and I purchased both as Christmas gifts."
"These sandals only lasted 4 months.  Reef sent me a new pair but a different design.  I stopped wearing these slippers years ago because they didn't last.  I wear Rainbow sandals but they were out of my size for months, so I finally broke down and tried reefs again.  I'm sorry I did.  Still the same weak design.  The tabs on the side straps only go into the sandals about 3/4 of an inch, not enough."
Shoes are  ok ....the tops are very thin the color is starting to peel off the shoe???I would  not buy again just the same
"Received it last night and had to return it this morning. I am so disappointed. This has such a great review but when I open it in the house to test, it won't close properly. I only press the open and close button, that works but when I push it back to original position it bounces right back. Had to force to shut it with the velcro and the case cover to return it. The handle part is very short which makes it a bit difficult to hold. It's a little under a pound, a bit heavy. Sad."
These look really cute....but they HURT.
"I saw fitted somewhat small, but the truth is that they were not proportioned at all. I'm 5'10 and these were short, but that was okay, but the waist fit very oddly, too loose and very loose in the hips. They looked ridiculous on me, I'll be giving them away. now if you're a curvy gal, they might fit you beautifully!"
I returned this because I received another better one as a gift.  Mine was NOT the bleached denim color as this photo!!?...it was darker.
"Seems OK. But, I can't wear it. It's too big. I don't know where to have it resized. I'll keep looking. I'll update the review once I have an opportunity to use the product."
They change colors there not gold no more
"Like most other boy's brief's the cotton rib fabric becomes rough after the first wash (and yes, I am washing them correctly).  And they have ironed-on tag that are very scratchy.  I was really disappointed.
Try City Threads.  I'm leaving a review for them next...  I ordered them on a whim and they are so wonderful!"
"So darn cute, got a 3x and i am normally a large  and i had to give this coat to my 10 year old daughter.... so disappointed."
the fit was way too small
"Very cool, but looks terrible on my small frame. Saving this for the 110+ days where I have to be out and about."
So tiny and useless
"ITS TOO NARROW,  THEY LOOK WIDE BUT ITS NOT, WHAT A SHAME.. I BOUGHT THEM FOR MY MAM AND NOW I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THEM...  THE STYLE IS OLD FASHION, I THINK.
THE ADVERTISEMENT SHOULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT THIS."
only Twiggy could wear it and that is if her arms hung down to her knees.
"If you think what you're getting is represented with the pictures, you're wrong. This entire webpage is a complete lie. Nothing is the right size and unless you're a midget nothing will fit a 32 inch waist or larger. No room for your package. They look like they fit a woman!"
uncomfortably small
"Comically too small, so that these are unwearable.  They barely fit over the toes and immediately fall off.  So frustrating."
Large is large in all places especially the waist....36 is large in the waist ...NOT 34
it fits  but it looks like a cheap plastic ...than a pleather
I really loved these for sublimation. The problem is that 30% of them are stained and worthless. The ones that aren't stained come out great. Just wish I wasn't dumping money and time down the drain 30% of the time.
I like the color and they fit Ok but the smell bad! The material is also weird! I washed them 3 times and they still smell so bad! I WANT TO THROW THEM IN THE GARBAGE!
Loved these sunnies but they broke as soon as I got them.
"I'm 5'7"", weigh 186 and am a pear shape meaning all hips no chest. The armholes were too large and the bottom portion fit good but a little too big. If only it had a sewn in slip that would really help too, very see through."
Way
"Super cute.  It's tiny though!  I got an xl and I'm 5'6"" about 140lbs.  I'll give it to my niece I guess."
"See through and loose around my knee, also washed it and the letters started to peel off"
Nice looking piece but way too small. We'll fit a child's wrist or small adult
GEMSTONE CHARM TOO SMALL. SORRY I PURCHASED IT.
WAY too small and refused to let me return.
"these are not genuine ray bans. They are decent fakes, but still fake nevertheless. The appearance is fine, but the fit and lens quality are not worth what these cost. I filed a complaint with Amazon, and they were super nice about it."
"Sorry to leave negative feedback, but I don't like these shoes at all.  I own a previous version of this shoe, which I love, but whatever they did to it doesn't work for me."
"uncomfortable, clunky, difficult to walk in"
"The concept is awesome but they are very hard to get onto my size 11.5 feet. I thought for a moment I bought a woman's size but, nope, these are for dudes."
"Itchy, heavy, weirdtype of jacket. Not a shirt"
This isn't cotton. Made my skin itch! Buy a size down because medium is like an extra large. I wear small and figured a medium would be roomy like my other nightgowns. Nope. This is massive
It was supposed to be 29 long...but it was no less than 32 long.  Way too long.  Won't buy again.  Returned one. Tried to shrink the other without success.
"Ordered a 3x and what arrived would barely qualify for a medium. Did not get sent wrong one, tag on inside said 3x. Very disappointed, will never buy again."
Material a bit thin.
"The sticker took off some of the fabric..
Don't think they are durable."
"I returned one because I ordered too big. Seller was quick and responsive in the exchange process. The coat itself lacks side pockets, which I hate. If you wear a 44 jacket, get a 44 size because the 46 is not fitting"
"I usually wear a size 9.5, but even in a size 10, the slippers were too small."
"This is the cheapest and thinnest suit you will ever buy.
The fact is the material is so cheap that you can actually see through the suit jacket!
Huh?

It would be embarrassing for your kid to wear this monstrosity."
Picture is much different than what I received. Quality and sizing seems to be off as well. Still nice looking boots but why can't the seller just post an accurate photo?? It's not rocket science.
"You can get worse shoes, but you'll have to try hard.

The Wave - Mens Aqua Shoe is a great way to protect your feet while swimming in the ocean or river.

That's about the only good thing I can say about these shoes.  Horrible for any type of land use, sole falls apart and leaves bits of black rubber everywhere you go, insole slips and makes an uncomfortable shoe unbearable, and after brief use the shoe starts to fall apart.  I used them one day, both in fresh water and salt water, and was glad to throw them out afterwards.

Don't get me wrong...they did their job, and I was glad for that.  Two stars for cheap shoes that protected my feet, but there are better shoes out there for water use that deserve 3 or more stars."
Horrible shoe for high arches...and no arch support!!! Do not buy!
"Fleece is fleece.  I'm sure you can find similar quality at a cheaper price.  I need the tall cut, however, and that's what is difficult to come by.  Really nothing special."
- Star.  Poor Quality.
"I have worn heels daily for 20+ years.  I feel more comfortable in heels than in flats if that helps put perspective on my next comments.

These were by FAR the cheapest pair of heels I have ever bought and worn.  The heel broke off within 6 hours of wearing while teaching.  It is not as if I chose to run down a city street to hail a cab & the heel broke like in the movies; the heel was literally wobbling off by mid-day and by the end of the day, both heels were caving forward as I stepped.  Each time I took a step, I had to walk flat-footed in order to not put any pressure on the heel with a heel/toe foot placement.  When I got home, I inspected the shoes and both heels were gaping at the back of the heel, literally coming away from the footbed.

Not nearly as well made as they should have been, I am greatly disappointed.  For the price of this shoe, one should be able to expect some wear beyond a single use.

Unfortunately, I was so thrilled by the style, color availability and price point of these shoes that I purchased 2 pairs (navy suede and orange) and now am looking a one ruined pair and the eventual ruin of the 2nd since I have no expectation that the 2nd pair is going to do any better.

You would be better served buying another pair of classic heels."
"The dress fit as expected but the wig wouldn't even fit a 5 year old, and that's the only reason I even bought the costume!"
"DO NOT BUY!  Unless you will modify it to make them work/fit.  Size 12 men's shoes and these were huge.  Should have believed the reviews, but I risked it based on the price and they ended up in the trash."
background appear off white in picture but is actually yellow.
ought one 3 yrs ago and loved it; this SECOND one is unsatisfactory.  The back keeps falling off  I cannot get it to stay ON!
Cute style but WAY too small!
This was cheap but I think would look great if you had a longer torso (regardless of how curvy).  My problem was there was too much material between the top and the bottom and it just folded on itself.  Otherwise I loved the style and thought the cutouts were well-shaped.
Poor quality. Weren't durable.
The style of the dress is cute and the color is awesome but that's where my enthusiasm plummeted. I ordered a small and it was entirely too big. It hung on me like a trash bag. I can't even say that maybe the wrong size was sent because the dress has no tags on it and no paperwork came with it. Not happy with the purchase.
first of all this ring is not true to size and it doesn't look like the picture the detailing of the picture is a lot clearer in person the stones look a lot more clustered the ring is still pretty out of 5 stars I give it a 21/2
"I wear a size 15 shoe.  It's hard to find a ""dress sock"" that fits.  I ordered the 2XL size (which supposedly fits my shoe size), hoping that they would fit.  It was so tight around my calf that I would never want to wear this sock.  Waste of money."
Wasn't pleased with this outfit. I bought a few of them all the same Disney baby just different patterns. The shirts all run super small. I bought 3/6 size and the shirts are like 3mo and the pants are huge more like 6/9 I struggle to get the shirts over my daughters head and are really short so her belly hangs out. and the pants fall off. Sad since they are so cute.
"Purchased these thinking that because they were Hush Puppies theyd be comfortable. Have had them for a few months now, and for general walking I find them to be okay. However, when I first got them I noticed how hard the back heel cup was and how there was just a thin felt padding for protection. I shouldve just returned them then and there, but I liked that the bottom sole was rubber-like and not hard like most other boots.

They initially didn't cause me trouble, however, recently I had to walk up a slight incline and immediately noticed a hot spot developing on the upper part of my heel. Sure enough, as the day wore on, a nice blister formed. These boots look deceivingly comfortable, but they're really not for all-day walking. The bottom padding/sole is comfortable, but the main issue I have is with the very uncomfortable heel cup and rubbing abrasively up against it. Also, I noticed a squeak develop in the soles. When all is quiet in my office and Im the only walking around, the squeak is embarrassing. As for sizing, I usually wear an 8 comfortably for boots, but these were a tad snug."
NOT POLARIZED!!! False advertisement to put that in the description. Will be returning.
Not for intense labor. I work in shotcrete and have to deal with wet and cement. These held up about two weeks. If your just shoveling snow or running a fork truck I suppose these would do. Not for dealing with rough and wet conditions.
"I am a size 9/M-L. I ordered the xxl and it is way too small, more like a size xs."
I sent this item back over one year ago.
Very nice shirt BUT to small!!!!
"I waste my money on this product because it doesn't fit my legs... Despite that I'm not a plus size girl, you would think it's ok without any problems.... Please don't believe the picture as it shown on the website... Don't waste your time spending it... That's a warning!!"
They didn't fit right and felt heavy when walking in them.  I donated them to Goodwill rather than go through the hassle of returning/exchanging.
"This thing is sooooo small...and falling apart at the seems...the sash is about 24"" ....that isn't even long enough for someone that has a 22"" waist...and it;s just a cheap fake satin...and the belt loops were already torn...the right one was already hanging off by a few threads.....I totally realize I only paid $4.67 or whatever....But, my Motto is..WHY BOTHER SEWING SOMETHING...And selling something..that YOU KNOW...is going to fall apart immediately.....or sooner....I have no doubt...that the girls that are packing these tiems..KNOW and SEE that the robes ARE FALLING APART AS THEY ARE PACKING THEM....and like I said...I know I didn't even spend $5. for it....and like I said....WHY BOTHER???  WHY BOTHER EVEN MAKING IT???""  ""WHY BOTHER WASTING THE MATERIAL AND THE THREAD??? JUST TO MAKE SOME JUNK?????"
PICTURE LOOKS BETTER.....RING IS NOT ALL THAT ATTRACTIVE
"After two days of wearing them the butterflies came off, tried gluing and snapping back in and lasted maybe another two days. Crappy !"
Very small and kinda un-even. Its cheap for a reason....
They were too small not true to size unfortunately I threw away the packaging so im stuck with them very disappointed
"A decent bag but does NOT do what I was looking for it to do. I wanted a carry on bag with garment bag feature. This bag claims to have design that would not crumpled the suits. I had a different experience, causing me to get dryclening and pressing some of my suite at the destination. The bag otherwise is study. The wheels are fine and go through rugged surfaces fine. The handle got stuck one time and didn't pull through tall the way."
"It would have been fine if I wanted to look like a cast member for Wolves on Ice. (Not a real show...I don't think.) Totally felt like an ice skaters outfit. It would probably have been comfortable but just wasn't my cup of tea. The seam that brings the top and bottom together hits at a weirdly high spot and made me look like I had a super short torso. I'm 5'2"", 130lbs and fairly busty. Didn't like the costume, back to the drawing board! :/"
These are terrible quality. I cannot believe Ugg would put their name on these slippers. Ive worn them for one day and they look horrible. Returning immediately. Picture was taken after one day of wear - they already look like they're 5 years old.
Nice shirt but too large. I gave it away
"I am a size 16 so I ordered a XXL.  The dress is a large at best!!  It looks cute but order at least 2 sizes up.  Definitely not meant for anyone over a size 12/14 and especially anyone with a large bust.  For $14 its not worth my effort to return it, where did they get that $45 retail price anyway?  What a joke."
"Sucks, they're SO cute, but WAYYYYYY too small. I have a large athletic bottom, but am consistently a size-7, I couldn't even get it past my mid thigh!"
"Returning it soon, well made and was a gift that did not work out.  Fabric nice and soft with clean lines."
I originally got these in a size 13. I have another pair of New Balance running shoes in size 13 and they fit very well. These were to large. Amazingly they have size 12.5. At first I thought they fit very well. There was room for my big toe but after I went on a run I found the taper at the end of the shoe was to tight and my 3 & 4th toe were smushed causing pain. I admit this is probably due to the shape of my toes but I've not run into this issue before with other shoes. I was forced to send them back although I would liked to have kept them. Outside of the toe pain they performed as expected. It's a very minimal shoe.
"Can hardly pull them up and can't button them, even though they are supposedly the same size as my other pants."
"Had to return. Top fit okay but the legs have a tighter elastic band and if you have any kind of thigh at all, it squeezes your legs. Ridiculous!"
Super crap avoid at all cost broke and stopped  working after 7 days
"My daughter (college aged and healthy thin) ordered these, they are longer in the picture than in person. She even ordered a size up but they fit and looked uncomfortable."
"Tried this as an alternative to the Cushion Solution product that I've purchased in the past, but my most recent buy did not adhere at all to my rings.

So, tried this as a hail mary as I have a number of rings which I use this type of product for.  ZERO effectiveness, comes off the first wearing.

Tried multiple rings after letting set a full 48 hours to cure (longer than needed) & it slides right off with ZERO adhesive quality.

I'm searching for some alternative, I this time I don't know of any - but this neither of these products work with their current formulation."
"narrow toe box, cheap feel"
"It rolls easy.  It is stable.  It is a good size.  It is not very durable.  On my second trip with this, one of the tubes that the extension handle is attached to was bent in airline handling.  It appears another bag may have been thrown on top, and an edge hit the back of the bag.  A fairly common occurrence in airline baggage handling I am sure.  I've had other roller bags for 15 years, and never had one of these tubes get bent.  The tubes are made of fairly light weight aluminum.  Heavier construction or stronger material would have made this type of damage less likely."
We thought we were buying SAS shoes.  These are just copies.  Not made in USA.  SAS shoes were soft and did not hurt my wife's feet. The drew's are stiff and hard.  My wife says they fit but are just not right.
Too baggy up the front
not comfortable at all heel way too narrow
Came pooly made. Sewn crooked and arrived n flat envelop
"order much bigger than you would expect, add two inches atleast to your regular waist size...decent fabric though, we'll see how it holds up in the wash?!"
they fit my large head great. but the smell is terrible and they sent some that hadn't had the white all the way coated around the glasses so there is a big blue steak on the sides. They are real polarized tho.
very small sizing way too narrow also does not support my foot as described
Asics is my preferred athletic shoe but this is a different animal.  The shoe is very stiff with a very narrow toe box.  The support was ok but it was so stiff your foot is pushed to conform to the shoe. I can't imagine walking for 18 holes in this shoe.
I first order a 7 1/2(my normal size) and they were a little snuggler so I gave them to my sister with slightly smaller feet and she loves them. Later I ordered a size 8 and they still don't seem to fit me very well as I can feel it rubbing on my pinky toe and I do not have wide feet by any means.
"The bag did not hold up well, I used it about 3 months before the strap stitching came unraveled and broke. Before that, it was beautiful. I will no longer be purchasing Vera Bradley though."
"Very disappointed. Cheap material, bad seam and package is wrapped in a dirty plastic bag. I guess it's only worth less than $5. Don't buy it."
Not a durable material.  Wore out quickly.
too transparent
Was ridiculously small .....
"Doesn't fit anywhere.  Good fabric, cute coat would love it if it was only in my size and I am a XL - XXL and this was a medium (made in China)"
"I have what I would consider normal sized feet, ankles, calves.  These were way too tight around the shin area.  I had to return them."
Very poorly made. One part came broke and the headband broke as soon as I put it on. Do not buy this product.
"This was purchased as a gift, there is a mark on the right sleeve that goes all the way around the sleeve, I was not able to send it back as the teenager I bought it for would not give it up, I am very disappointed with this purchase."
inferior materials and workmanship
"Very disappointed! Cheap fabric that looks and feels like shiny children's pajamas. I thought the Santa pattern was so cute, but it just looks awful in person."
The material so thin. You can practically see through it.
"Beware of the sizing chart!  I have never found a 10.5 (sz 44) shoe that is too SHORT on my foot.  These shoes don't fit.  It's going to cost me $10 to return, and the seller doesn't even have the next size up in stock.  On the bright side, the shoes SEEM very comfortable.  I'm just very disappointed in the product description, the seller's stock and the return policy.  Basically, I wasted two weeks and ten dollars and I've got nothing to show for it except this negative review."
"I don't normally order clothing online but, I was feeling adventurous and gave it a shot.  The pants arrived in good condition and on time.  I should mention I'm short 5ft 3in and have longer legs than torso..  I ordered the 3x.  I actually could've ordered a 2x but, I think the fit would still be off.  They were much too long, baggy and ill fitting.  I felt like a sack of potatoes all lumps.. I really wanted to like these pants but, they offered no support or structure.  Yes, I'm overweight but, I have other athletic style pants that fit my curves and are much more flattering.  I was hoping for the best sadly I have to return them."
"I tried these on when they first arrived, over a pair of underwear I was already wearing and I thought they'd fit great.
Threw all 5 pairs in the washer and dryer and they came out a lot smaller.

I'm a big guy at 6'2"" ~ 285lbs with big thighs and these simply won't cut it after they shrunk.  :(

I guess I will just give them to my father who's quite a lot smaller.

Quality of material is very nice but they ended up too snug in the wrong places."
"The jacket is nice but the sizing is totally wrong ....
It's real small even in the shoulder ... Thank God Amazon has a no pain return policy where I don't even have to leave the house !"
"The shoes are stylish, but the smell is unbearable, I opened the box and as soon as I smelled the scent I got nauseous and got a headache i left the shoes in a basement for days and the smell hasn't gone away and I don't think it ever will so I returned them."
These were cute and fit as expected and REEKED of artificial strawberry scent.  My five-year-old took one sniff and told me to send them back.
don't like where the adjustment thing is
"Had these boots for about two weeks and they are awful. My past pair of boots was the Valsetz and they were so comfortable. These boots on the other hand are painful to wear, I feel like I'm standing on sharp rocks. Would not recommend these boots; I am returning them."
I wore these for the first time today and both soles fell off. Pay more money for a better product.
"Poor quality, loose threads right out of the package. Doesn't fit well, loose in the chest and very tight in the stomach and butt. Also much shorter than advertised. White part is see-through. Color is bright teal, not the kelly green pictured."
I returned this....there a mini pads in the top...it is bathing suit material and ran very small.
"Love it but the pattern seems to be printed on some kind of plastic paper and after a couple of months of not particularly heavy use, is peerling off a bit around the edge."
"I ordered a size 30 length and got a 34 length. I should have saved everything to send it back but I did not. My fault. I kept them and thought they might be hemmed which would be cheaper than mailing back. Good material but it constantly looks wrinkled and it hard to iron. 38 waist was way large for 38. I have bought many 38s on line and this was more like a 40. Even if I got the pants replaced by the correct fiiting size, I still hate the wrinkled look. Buy at your own risk. This is the first time that I had a problem with Dockers."
Not as comfy as I had hoped.  A coworker lives hers.  I have wider feet.  Not comfy as I need them to be.  
"This beanie came in a little too large and also within about two days, some of the threads were coming apart. Not a very good beanie at all honestly. It is very thin and it severe cold weather, it will not keep your head warm."
"It's not a18k Gold, it's a fashion piece. I guess you get what you paid for. I wouldn't recommend."
Fit when I got it and it then fell apart after washing. Cheaply made in China most likely.
"holy cow bought this and tried it in for the first time and the chain just SNAPPED right out of the bracelet! what a WASTE! knowing i just got it, i was extra careful, but the material was soo cheap, and returning it was such a hassle knowing i have to pay for the shipping. wow not buying here again."
"bought these just before school stared and I've been throwing away a lot of these lately for having holes in them, unless you wanna be buying new socks in 5 months, don't buy these!"
"This item is not as pictured AT ALL.  it does NOT cover your chest, it's ridiculously narrow in the front.  There is no way you could wear it in public.  Also, I read that it ran small, so I ordered an XL, even though I normally wear a Small or a Medium in everything...and this swimsuit was SO TINY it was comical.  Sure, it was sexy, but I don't want to risk my nips popping out at the beach."
about to give it away very uncomfortable shoes this is my first nine west and i guss my last. color nice bright yellow
"not to toot my own horn, but i am a rather shapely person, i wear a size 2 and this is the most unflattering dress i have purchased in a long time. i'm wondering if i should employ the time and energy to even go to the post office and pay for postage to ship this back or just give it to a friend that may like it better than i did. it is EXTREMELY scratch, the bust is definitely poorly made and doesn't fit the boob area nicely at all. it just looks very cheap and i couldn't be more disappointed with this purchase."
"Cheap material. It is not tulle, looks like mosquito net."
My daughter bought these for a dance recital and they started peeling in big flakes in the crotch area after she had them on for about 10 mins. She is a little bitty thing so thigh friction is definitely the cause.  :( We loved the look but was horribly disappointed they didn't even last ONE night :( #tears maybe we just go a bad egg?
"Cheap, fake cr@p. Not even a good knock-off. Go to Walmart and buy a cheap t-shirt and a sharpie to write Under Armour on it and you have a better shirt"
Cheap socks!
"Returned. I like the dress, however, I did not like the two piece option."
Even with adjusted straps all the way tight it is way to big!
"They look good but the threads are horrible, making them a pain to get on and off and the coating on some of them scratches easily."
Really bulky and uncomfortable.  Not flattering.
Comfortable but buy a size bigger
If you are Queen Size 1x-2x these will NOT fit you. These are great if you are VERY VERY VERY TALL.  If you have hips/belly/butt these will NOT fit you. These are Queen Size if you are tall. These are NOT Queen Size if you are chubby.
Fabric is too see-through and so flexible that overtime shorts fit loose.
I didn't like the color of these shoes and I had to go up a 1/2 larger than what usually wear as these are cut very small.  I returned these shoes.
"I love these guys - I have 3 now. When I got the white one in, it had a nice cream stain on it so I won't be keeping it. The other two are awesome."
The right thigh of the pant is smaller that the left and the entire front top area pulls to the right.  It's extremely uncomfortable and looks to be made poorly.  The seller emailed me to ensure I was happy - I told them I was not about 3 days ago and have not heard back. Sucky pants and sucky customer service.
"Way too big-not proportioned well, had to return."
"not what I expected at all.. very cheap made.. glad I didn't spend the original price of 39.99 for this dress. The dress is very very thin, like a cheap Halloween costume from Walmart or Dollar General, pettiskirt won't stay up, keeps slipping down on my daughter and not full at all, scarf is cute, belt is fake plastic and cheaply made.. very very disappointed in this product."
Disappointing. The tail part fell off and got lost the first time my daughter wore it. I wouldn't buy it again.
"Actual color is mustard, not yellow."
"I'm 6'2, 200lbs, with an athletic build and the XL was really snug. Short sleeves (2"" too short), body length not long enough, and nearly skin tight. Maybe it's supposed to fit that way, but it's not what I was expecting."
"These shorts are huge and too long, too. They just need a little more length and they could be sweatpants!"
Broke in a couple days but I honestly wasn't surprised.  It was a valentine's day gift for my son's girlfriend and he needed a cheap gift.
I could barely read the engraving. The metal scratched my arm.
"I ordered a larger size than I usually wear but I couldn't even get it on, let alone wear it."
"i don't get it. its size 11,.5 and  way too small"
I was surprised when I washed the shirt and tried it on.  The sleeves were shorter than any other shirt that I own.  I did not wash the shirt any differently. Maybe my wife can convert the shirt into a short sleeve shirt.
"Wanted to love it, but despite ordering up from the size it indicated I needed it was still small. Also, stitching around the boob was weird."
"The inside kept peeling, very irritated"
The color is darker than I wanted/needed.
Beyond disappointed! Bought this for my 14 year olds school 8th grade graduation and I get a size 1 suit! For a baby/toddler!
"Although it's made of cotton,, these are too loose!"
Bad..........
THE DECORATION CAME OFF IN A FEW DAYS OF WEARING IT
"unlike invicta, this looks cheaply made"
side buttons do not work are ornamental
waaaaaay too small. Multiple sizes too small.
This fits like a paper sack. It has no shape to it. The arm holes are too wide.
Not good at all
"Poor quality and fit small. When the pants came out of the packing , you unfold the pants and hear the elastic crackling."
Cross was too big and ornate.
"On the positive side, Amazon had Free Returns on this item.  As for the pants... I got these because they are called 'traveler's pants' and I'm going to be travelling on a plane for 13 hours next weekend.  I wanted something comfortable (i.e. a bit roomy) with conveniently placed generous easy access pockets. I wish these pants were just that, but they are not.

While not tight, the pants seat and crotch were definitely 'regular fit' and there is no elastic in the waist.  The pockets are not cargo, but flat & internal to the leg area.  The pockets have two buttons per flap and the buttonholes are just barely big enough to permit the buttons to pass thru.  I'll be generous and say whomever designed the pockets wanted to make sure there was not a chance in hell they would 'accidentally' unbutton.  Apparently they didn't want you overdoing it by carrying too much in them either.

So for 'travelers pants', they aren't roomy and the pockets aren't generous or easy to open.  I'm really not sure what mode of 'travel' is envisioned here, but it isn't one where you have to sit in uncomfortable positions for long periods of time or empty your pockets and produce a passport at a moments notice.  These also don't pass for 'normal' pants; the black pant material is a bit shiny, verging on '1980's parachute pants' territory.

One last note. Upon opening the package, the pants nylon material produced an INCREDIBLE static field.  Imagine if the nice folks at 'Swiffer' made special pants intentionally designed to attract all the hair & dust on your floor and you've got the picture.  Maybe this goes away after washing, but I knew these were going back within the first 30 seconds I had them on, so I'll never know."
"I hate this watch! I am a small woman and this thing is just huge and uncomfortable. I will be returning it ASAP.
Another thing to set the watch and adjust date and time you have to unscrew the crystal.... and then screw it back tightly so it will be again waterproof.... my advice... don't even consider it.
The watch is just too large and bulky and trying to adjust it is just to complicated."
Mediocre quality. Fit fine. Kinda see-through.
"Fit small, no returns"
Got the pants in small petite and they were huge!!! Even my dad fit in them!! Looked ridiculous like parachutes. I'm normally small/ medium maybe two x small would've fit.
"Not a bad fit, reasonably comfortable.  However, after just one week they started squeaking when walking on carpet despite never getting wet.  These shoes are now great paper weights."
"I really liked these sandals at first.  One of the other reviewers said they seemed kind of ""cheap"" and I agreed a bit but since I only bought them to wear with shorts and casual outfits, I wasn't really concerned.  However, after I wore them about 5 times, they started to stretch out.  They are now so loose they barely stay on my feet.  I think they'll have to go in the give away pile next summer."
"I was hoping this skirt would be a lot like yoga pant material, but it is much less flexible/comfortable and has a cheap-looking sheen to it. I found the sizing to be large in the waist and quite small in the hips. I wouldn't recommend."
"I usually wear x-small petite length in Jockey scrubs, but these are way too form fitting to be professional looking on me. I'm 5'3 with a 37in hip, and the thighs on these pants look like leggings on me. I'd wear them as yoga pants, but the back barely covers my rear end. It's a shame, because I love my other Jockey scrubs."
"These are not unisex unless you are a very big girl.  I got one for my husband and me and they are way too big.  He said the L is for a guy that weighs about 300 #s.  He weighs 180.  The weight and construction seemed fine, but the sizing is off.  I am 5'4"" and usually weigh a L and this robe hit the floor and was just too big all around.  I ended up going to Land's End and getting a Petite Large and it fits perfectly."
Ordered the size based on reviews and sadly it was too big. It's pretty thin materiel and because it's too big it doesn't do what it's supposed to. Tried wearing it without a bra because it claims you don't need one.... I guess if you are smaller on top it would be ok but being a D cup a bra was a must.
"The sandals were fit as expected, but they were heavy and hurt my toes wearing them."
Too large by at least a full size and no padding whatsoever.  Sent back.
"meh, cheap"
Ankle strap was too low on the ankle - was not a good fit.
"It's a cute shirt. It's cheap but unlike some others like it that I bought, the material is actually pretty decent. Problem is that it shrinks to about 1/4 it's size after first wash. It might be ok if you wash it cold and air dry it."
did do the arch support it suggested
"This shirt was disappointing.  It needs to be ironed and this I won't do for a work shirt.  I fits like a glove, too tight on my husband.  He wears it but doesn't like the fit.  It is also very light weight.  I will stick to the KEY brand and pay a little more for a much better shirt."
The leggings are a nice design but after the first wear I can tell they won't stay pretty long. The already show the linty effects of worn out leggings
"I never EVER returned anything. But had to return these because the sizing was odd. My feet are normal to narrow, and these shoes kept slipping off. Got them in a 36, and I'm a solid 6/36.. however my feet kept slipping off and my ankles had no support which is why I had to return them. I'm so sad because I really wanted these to work."
"+++++ Updated review, October+++++
It's been 3 months since I bought this product. I mainly use this to haul things between from my car and to my 3rd floor apartment. Groceries, books, bags. I've never carried anything heavy, like, a carton of water from Costco. I've noticed one if of the wheel have gotten wiggly and started to make funny noises. One of the wheel have a crack. And the rim was bent. I'm attaching photos. I'm not complaining cuz I've gotten a good use out of it and it's not bad for the price.. But I was hoping it would last a bit more than 3 months.

===original review, July==
It's nice light and compact. I use it to haul heavy shipping items from my car to my third floor apartment. Wheels are sturdy. Comes with the stretchy cord. I'm very happy with it."
Great look. Fit is loose and not tight like what I tried on at the Oakley store in the mall... maybe just this pair?
"Would fit a child, but surely not an adult xl."
"Ordered the 2.5"". They are NOT 2.5"", they are longer, and stick out so they can't be used."
"did not realize that the measurements of these jeans are the actual measurement of your waist, not your pants size...had to send back"
THE BOOTS FIT OK
wayyyy too small! took forever to get here (from china!) material sucked... very cheap!
"I got the turquoise, which is not the same color the website depicted. It's more of a faded color, not cute. Also the neckline was higher and the hem was shorter. The picture made it look like there was a good 10+ inches of fabric where it flares out. Not so. Only 6. I was also hoping for a nice breathable fabric. This feels like it's going to make me too hot, a polyester feel. Overall I am not impressed. Will be sending mine back."
"100% Cotton?  Doesn't feel like it.  Reminds me of those gritty brown towels in highway restrooms.  FOTL isn't the only one dialing back on the cotton it seems, my latest Jockeys suck too!"
I didn't like. Its too large in the back
"This bodysuit would fit someone who is as wide as they are tall. However I am tall and queen size so the combination does not work. I am 5 foot 10 and about 200 pounds, wearing a size 16.  It simply does not stretch that far up even though there's still plenty of room to stretch sideways"
"color is completely wrong, cut is different than pictured in the larger size,"
size is way off but no receipt in box to send it back!
The skirt I received should be called just aqua. Instead of the brown and white color scheme with just a touch of aqua my skirt is mostly aqua color. Not what I expected but still keeping it as it is more hassle to return. Material is slinky but more sheer than some other comments lead me to believe. Definitely need a slip.
Very flimsy! !! Clasp broke immediately and I lost it first day...
"I got this for my 10 year old daughter and she picked it out herself.  When it came, it fit on the top, but the bottom was too short that it was weird.  And as if this wasn't terrible enough, the hat was not a hat but a fake on that looks like it but fit terrible as well.  I know these cheapy costumes aren't quality material but come on!  It has to look decent at least!  This would've been the first time I bought a Halloween costume for her online. Never gonna do that again.  Returned!"
"Disappointed. I thought this would fit as a open sided loose tank. The top is loose, the sides are cut low but the bottom is much tighter. Odd fit."
"Didnt fit, returned it."
"Runs smaller than usual. Photo shows a print; I received a solid. I did not return because they did fit, just not usual M.  They have lightweight, which I love, and cool for summer nights."
"Comfy but shrunk in length and waist quite a bit after a few washes. I bought 31x34 and it ended up fitting like 30x31 after a few washes, which made me have to get rid of em. Bummer too because they're expensive"
These run really small and narrow.
Cups are weird! They're spaced really far apart. The 32C was too big for me.
"Adorable swimsuit, totally wonky construction. The breast padding is perfectly circular, which might work for someone less than an A cup, maybe a small B, but otherwise the padding is set too high so you end up with the dreaded ""double bubble"" that makes you look like you have four boobs. If you have a bigger chest (C or bigger), you will need to remove the circular shaped padding and replace it with something more natural or else there won't be any support. The padding is in between two layers of fabric, rather than a built-in shelf bra, so without that padding there is zero support. And because the padded cups are set so high, there is zero support. Between the upper bra part and the boy shorts, it is connected by very stretchy fabric that doesn't have any spandex in it at all. The top of the suit does, the boy shorts do as well, but nothing in the middle. And when you squeeze the top and the bottom, and not the middle, guess where it all gets pushed out? The shoulder straps and the back top of the suit were great, and I like the little bit of fabric that covers where the cleavage plunge would be, and the material itself (the suit, not the middle section that holds the top and bottom together) is comfortable, but the proportions are just so bizarre. The overlay skirt is the same as well. The picture shows it looking like it comes down free flowing from right underneath the breast, but it actually doesn't go out until it hits your waist about halfway down. It's not a true empire waist, more like a super short mermaid style where it's close fitting at the top and then it widens at the bottom. The way the attached boy shorts fit is off. There is too much fabric in the crotch area - compared to other suits I have that space is three times the size it should be, like someone had a thigh gap of four inches or so. If it weren't that wide that much fabric, it would fit better. Overall, the suit fit small. I ordered my normal size plus one a few sizes up just in case. The one in my size didn't fit well at as the padded chest area was even higher than the oversized one, smaller padded circle cups, but the boy shorts were still wide in the crotch area. Actually, the only difference between the two sizes I could tell is the top. The larger size had more room for the chest and slightly bigger padding circles, but that's it. The rest of the suit fit the same, was cut the same, same material, etc.

I am truly disappointed this suit didn't work out for me. If you have a big chest, an apple or pear shaped body, or just a larger tummy, this looks like it will be a flattering suit, but the way the middle fits it unfortunately isn't. If you carry your weight equally over your body and have smaller chest, then give this a try."
"I'm 5'2"" and 123lbs, usually a size 8 or medium. I ordered small because of reviews that said they run big. They were huge in the waist. I can't wear them. Sending them back"
"This is ridiculous..
. it's like a slingshot & its not comfortable ..i don't find it sexy at all...
in fact i would be laughing the whole time i was wearing it ..or i would wear  a mask with it to hide my expression....
 my cats will enjoy it more than i ..
Oh and the strings are oversized ponytail holders !
its small and shows alot of your good shape off ..
but its ugly and stupid in my opinion"
"Poor design. It's both too small and too large. The picture makes it look like well-proportioned pants. But it's nothing like that--the legs are designed for elephants, whereas the waist is too tight for a child! I bought this because the inseam is 26"", which is hard to find. And I like clothes loose and comfortable, so I thought this would work. But the waistband is painfully tight.

I find the elastic waist on almost everything you buy these days (pants, pantyhose, etc), especially items made in China, is far too tight and painful. I will buy a size Large (I am 5', 110 lb) hoping for a comfortable waistband. But no such luck. THe fact that it's elastic and stretches doesn't make it any more comfortable or healthy to wear."
These leggings are sheer like hosiery. They are not true to size and are not as thick as I like my leggings.
"Socks are very thin, with a noticeable seam running the length of the sock.  I bought these because my feet get cold in the winter, and I love having thick, warm socks to wear around the house.  I was taken in by ""Polarex Fleece"" - these are neither thick nor warm.  And I have worn them for only a few months and already have a hole in one of them.

Might be fine as a layered sock under a heavier, warmer sock.  Maybe."
"I ordered these boots in black for my 14 yr old daughter. She was thrilled when they arrived--they were cute and fit well. However, when she got home from school on the SECOND day she wore them, the sole on both boots had begun separating. I tried to glue them back on, but it looked horrible.

I realize these are not expensive shoes, but I didn't expect only 2 wears out of them. I bought her some almost exactly like this at Wal-Mart a year or two ago, and they held up with almost daily wear until she outgrew them."
Not what I expected very small really wish it fit loved the color but it needs to go back asap
The leather for the laces is dry and will break during tying.
Returned as they come basically all in white. not what I wanted!
They are to small. I have 5 pair of the Carhartt pants that fit just fine at that size
"Runs very, very, very small. Orders 2 sizes up and still small."
"I've had my eye on these shoes for over a year, but didn't want to splurge on such an expensive pair of shoes.  I finally treated myself and what I get in the mail are basically extremely overpriced ballet flats.  I could have bought this same exact thing at payless for 10 dollars.  None of the pictures or descriptions showed the actual material these were made out of.  I doubt these will even last a few months.  Then to top it off when I finally resigned myself to the fact that I was ripped off, while wearing them there is a piece in the back of the left shoe that painfully pokes into the back of my ankle.  I am so disappointed.  I will never buy from this company again."
"These sandals don't fit we'll at all, and the material was scratchy & not finished smoothly. I returned them. They looked cute in the picture, but in actuality were awful. Don't waste your time and money on these."
"Very small backpack, we had to return it.  There was not much room in the large compartment.  The colors were pretty, but the materials were very thin and did not seem sturdy."
Just looked weird on me
Absolute garbage don't waste your time.
"Very cheaply made. If my daughter didn't insist u dress as Anna there is no way I wouldn't have paid that much for a thin, cheap costume. Fit well though."
The bag I received had a totally different color scheme and is kind if ugly.  It does fir my Kindle so I tell use it until I find something better.  Very disappointed.
"Beautiful color but this dress was not for me. It looked to be reversible, so the inside material was not comfortable at all. it was also very long and made me look very hippy. I returned it."
cute but too short and not a great fit. Returned item.
Not made for girls with thick thighs. :( Not stretchy so they do not come up my thigh enough to stay up and they are really tight on my lower thigh. I'll keep looking but I have returned these.
"No complaints about the shoe or its ability to shoe, but water leaks in from the bottom during even light rain."
Very transparent material. Sent them back. They were comfortable. Might be ok in another color.
Too large and too long. Weird sizing. I have to return it.
Very disappointed.  Cheap looking and made
14 inches is very small so keep that in mind. The chain is also very thin and cheap looking and feeling.
"Haaaaate this bra. It is not comfortable, feels rough, and makes my breasts look like funnels. It is too small, and seems a little smaller around than my other bras - sports, leisure and balconette - and the cups are smaller. Hence the coning of my breasts. Those bras mentioned above are the same size as this bra I ordered and it is slightly smaller around and the cups are about half a size smaller. I was hoping to find a good G cup sports bra - it looked so good on here. I would send it back if I wouldn't have moved to a new city and would have to take a bus all the way to the post office just to send it back."
The shoes look nice I can give them that. But I don't know what happened to Clarks. I tried a pair on in store and had to return them as well. These shoes make my feet hurt more than my flat vans do when I stand all day for work. I was really dissapointed and thought maybe I was tripping. But my feet where aching so much after wearing them.
"I need to return, too boxy for my shape.  5'6"", size 6 dress.  Probably look good on ultra thin physiques"
"I bought this to wear with a revealing Halloween costume. Based on reviews of women with my same cup size (DD), I was encouraged that this would keep the girls in check. Yeah, I was wrong. While very sticky (which is the only plus), they did nothing to lift or support my breasts. I ended up just going bra-less rather than wear these ridiculous boob covers a second longer than I had to. I actually even threw them away afterwards because they served no purpose. Not only that but the way they stuck to me, they gave my breasts a weird and extremely unflattering shape. I should have listened to my instincts and not bought these, totally useless for someone of my cup size. I will say that the shipping was fast and the product well packaged. If you have a smaller cup size these would probably work really well, just not for a DD."
"I like the cut of this shirt, unfortunately the XL I bought runs VERY tight. More like a medium. I bought two and one is still in the package because I just can't wear it. And because of the tightness, I couldn't get the top down to feed so it's doubly useless for me.

However, the pros are the material is soft and the colors are nice. Just adjust for size."
YOU DON'T GET what is pictured!!!!
"This docks were ordered for my husband. And while they fit well, the wool is a little thin. He has asked me to return them."
blown...super cut. not sure why they don't use proper models... 2xl more like medium
These diamonds were very cloudy.  Not at all as shown or advertised.  Sent them back immediately.  Gave it one star just because the packaging was very pretty - too bad the earrings weren't as nice as the box.
"This is a good summer dress if your just kicking around the house, but the material is way thin and the colors looked washed out to me. Too bad because it looked way better in the picture. I kept this dress to wear when I'm only around the house I would never wear it out."
"Beautiful color, but when you receive a hat that is rolled up, there is no amount of reforming can fix it.  Too expensive for what you get."
They are too small and fall off easier than other socks.
i had to return this item. uggg this is a beautiful shoe but the stones fell out andd the shoe is not made for people with wide feet
"I bought this luggage based on good reviews for a 3-week trip to Europe. Unfortunately, on the second day the zipper pull broke and made this pretty impossible to open. I then had to spend the next 3 weeks struggling to open the suitcase.

I contacted Amazon and was told the return period was over, however they were willing to send a return label and refund my money. This is actually what I would expect so I am happy to report it as my experience. My one complaint, though, is that I don't have a box large enough for the return and Amazon wasn't able to help with this. Moral is not to order luggage or large items off Amazon, or have a large enough space to hang on to boxes (which I don't in my Chicago apt)."
"I thought I would love these skechers.  Howver, they did not give enough and it was so much work to get them on I decided to return them."
These are HUGE I wasn't pleased at all.
"It looked great, and the fit was super cute! But when it got wet, it was entirely see through- NOT GOOD! : ( Extremely embarrassing and I won't ever be able to wear it again."
"I could barely fit in a Medium. I'm 143lbs, Size 6. I'm returning these."
"Sad these weren't better made shoes, the fit as snug, but they eventually wore out. The shoes get dirty very easily and offer NO arch support..."
Not very good quality for price. Some of stripes were not completely printed and looked worn. Cute but not worth the price. I would send it back but I really nice an umbrella style like this. Good design even if not good materials.
Wasn't really a relaxed fit-had to send it back.
Way too small! I read the other reviews saying that it ran small so I ordered one size bigger than what I wear. And it was still at least 2 sizes too small for me but the tag read the size I ordered.
"Could not get them on...I have high arches - they aren't made for high arches.  Thanks to Amazon, I returned them with ease."
This swim suit looks very cute however it didn't cover the bottom very well and exposed too much from behind.
Ordered L. Received S.
"The tag on this black and white pair said ""curvy"" meaning generous in upper calf area but this pair is very tight and constrictive on my 15 inch calf. Strangely enough the red and black pair are wonderfully comfortable. This pair is either mislabeled or not manufactured properly to size."
I am done buying crocs online! These were crazy small-I ordered size 6 for my daughter and they're smaller than the ones she has now! I am so confused on croc sizing.
This watch is a piece of garbage! It's so big it can fit an elephant. The watch is set at Japanese time zone; the reset button do not work. It's a waste of money.
Does not fit at all. Runs too small
Very awkward!! Its longer in the back than expected (it reaches down below my knees). The front is cute but the back is very unflattering. Perhaps it would look best on a tall and very curvy girl but not for me!
very cheaply made.  fit is more like 2T than 3T
"The picture of this item is deceiving! Looking at the picture I assumed I would be getting something more along the lines of a cartigan, and cotton or polyester. But no, what I got was something that an older woman would wear. Its completely sheer and huge! I thought I received the wrong item so I had them resend it, which they did quickly, but I just received the same item. Giving it to my grandmother for Christmas."
Made this purchase because the item looked very cute; but it was very small & fell apart before wearing! I will not be ordering again & not even worth it to return. Also it takes forever to receive!
"Looked too much like a plastic bag ,but the liner is nice."
"I have other dresses from Alki'i which fit similar to this one. I'm 6', ~230 lbs, wear 38C bra size, and this fit well and was long enough to not require wearing leggings or anything underneath (a little bit above the knee). However, when the dress arrived, it had a tag sewn on on the outside (who does that?). The liner also seems incredibly detrimental, making it appear frumpy and incredibly unattractive when worn. I could recommend this only as a cover-up, but even then I think it still wouldn't look too good if you wear it for any length of time."
Cheaply made. Falls apart after washing even on hand wash/delicate cycle.
I had high expectations for this tutu since it had such great reviews but Im a little disappointed. First of all Im 56 and 122lbs and ordered a medium because I read this runs small. The medium fits great around the waist but this barely touches my knees. This is definitely a lot shorter than the images left in other reviews. I figured ordering a size up would at least give me the length i desired. The gift ribbon they provided also does not match the color of the tutu at all which is really annoying to me and I feel wearing he tutu without the ribbon just looks tacky with the waistband.  I just wanted to wear this for a 30th birthday phot shoot but Its not even cute. I will be returning.
Love the design but way to snug by a bigger size I thought it was cotton?
will not hold normal glasses...the ends are too large
Special gift for the father of my daughter and it came broken. He had to go out and buy a chain for it as soon as he opened the package.
Turned in 2 weeks...sucks
"These pants in white denim are a complete let-down. Trust me and do not by them until they have corrected the style. The problem is the front pockets.  They are somehow connected to each other and the fake zipper area with the white pocket material across your abdomen which is completely see-through through the white denim. See photo, look carefully. When will these designers realize that pockets need to be nude fabric? If it were just the individual pockets this style might be OK, but the way the pockets are connected to each other in the front is just plain weird. It is too bad because they fit great. They were a little tough to get all the way up (and were way more tight in the waist than the size 4 I received in Hazelnut) but once I got them up they felt great and gave such a nice smooth silhouette. No muffin top. The only way these can be worn without looking ridiculous is with long tunic style tops that cover the entire pocket area.  At this price point you can do better."
Too wide for my narrow feet . I think the quality is not as good as I expected.
"as all the rest, the pocket is not large enough"
"The first one ripped within two months, so we are on to the second. Wouldn't have been so bad, but once you figure in the shipping, these are definitely not worth the price."
"Original review :  I'm giving these leggings four stars because according to the size chart, I was supposed to purchase a large which I did. However, the large did not fit as snug as leggings are supposed to fit. The waist and leg area both were loose. I took the tag off and washed and dried them so I cannot return but I do feel as though I lost 36 dollars because I don't feel comfortable wearing loose fitting leggings with the outfits I had planned to wear these HUE leggings with. I have purchased HUE curvy denim leggings in large and they should be arriving today... I'm hoping the elasticity in those are a little less stretchy so maybe the large will fit and I won't have to go through the hassle of returning the ""jeggings"". I believe that if there leggings were a little tighter I would really love them.

After wearing leggings for a few weeks (not consistently) : okay this review started with four stars because the item was not exactly true to size and pretty expensive to me. Also the leggings are see through. Now I have to rate them 1 star because the stitching on the leggings are all starting to come apart and I can't even wear them anymore. I am truly disappointed because I have purchased multiple pairs =("
"Very dissapointed! These shoes are larger my other 3 pairs of JM size ten. They are not like in the photo, because they are just color  tan without the black touches, which gives the casual/bohemian look of the photo. The quality is Ok, but unfortunately the size is tooooooooooo large. These shoes are perfect if you work in a circus like a clown."
"I don't understand the sizing of these pants at all.  There is 6, 8, and then 10-12.  12s don't fit children who wear size 10s.  They are about 4 inches too long.

The waist fits our size 10 boy perfectly.  He is tall and narrow.  The pants are way too long, too long to even roll over once.

This kind of sizing is appropriate for big things like sweatshirts, but not for pants."
I'm sure the shirts will be fine but the discription says assorted colors gray and black and they are all gray. I wanted black ones also. Misleading.
The print is absolute garbage definitely an iron on. I ordered a size XL shirt it says XL but I'm lucky if it's a medium oh and it shipped all the way from China!
"I have 2 different pairs of Dockers men's pants that I am extremely happy with. I purchased both pairs at department stores and was hoping to find another pair of Dockers pants at a good price, here. Unfortunately this pair didn't work out for me. My first 2 criterias were met in that the fabric was extremely soft and the waist was not adjustable. I was happy with that because I don't like expandable waist in my pants. The waist size fit true to my normal pant size but unfortunately the length did not. The length was slightly short as well as the fit was too tight in the crotch and thigh area which I did not experience from both of the pairs that I had purchased in department stores. I'm going to be returning these particular pair of pants. I do have a large waist and I'm a tall male although I have a stocky and athletic build for my size and I was surprised that the pants didn't fit similar to the others that I had purchased elsewhere. I also didn't like the "" washed "" look of the pants. They have a worn, used look to them. The word washed was in the description of the pants so I guess I can't say that I'm surprised and I'm not upset, just that I don't fancy that look. I like my new pants to look new."
The x-large will fit medium.  Could not get it past my bust.
The sole for this shoe is not good. It has no cushioning effect and somewhat hard.
My Kid is 15 a little big on Her she might grow in to it
Too small~Returned.
Dont like it at all.
Way to large and definitely cheaply made but wouldnt expect more for shoes that cost 10 bucks
Fake Picture and the build is really flimsy. Too expensive for the type of plastic. The only reason I gave one star is there is no choice to give no star at all. Don't waste your money buying this.
I got this for my husband in size Large and after I washed them properly they look like Small size.
"Got this for a gift for my sister and it was wayyy to small on her, it was sad because the shoes look great but don't fit her at all"
Too large and too long.  I will ask if anyone in my water aerobics class wants it.
The top fit but the bottoms look like it was a child size. The bottoms wouldn't fit an eight year old.
They are more of a purple pink and they don't fit as well as I hoped. Returned them.
"Love the look, a little big but nice but it fell off my dresser and the screen cracked first week I got it!"
"Very cheaply made, wouldn't purchase again !!"
"I'm another disappointed customer. I've always loved Isotoner Ballerina slippers, but they have changed, as other have said. I wear a 7.5 AA shoe. I tried both a Size M and a Size L.  The Size M is too small for me, and the Size L is too big. Also, I don't like how they have ""lowered"" the part covering the toes - i.e., there is now less coverage.  I returned them both and am going to try a different brand.  (They ARE cute, though.)"
"I'm a big guy but 2x shirts are usually big on me, I just prefer a lose fit. This shirt was supposed to be a 2x but fit more like a medium. It was so far off that I kept checking the label to be sure I wasn't misreading it. The fabric was thin enough to almost read through. Overall the quality seemed poor, I have bought this brand before and have been satisfied but with so many companies changing hands, perhaps the standards for Dickies has dropped as it has with so many companies. I rarely give 1 star but this shirt came close."
"After having read the reviews, I purchased 2 sizes  up from the large I regularly wear..... and it was way too small .... the size chart is way off ..... too bad because I really liked the look and softness ...."
"I ordered a pair of these shorts in both Taupe and Coral color.  I ordered the same size.  As you can see in the pic, while they are both a size 3, the Taupe are much smaller at the waistline.  The Coral pair fit great and I love them.  I sent the Taupe pair back and have ordered another pair of the same size to hopefully have an accurate size 3 delivered.  I'll revise post if I receive a pair that is in fact a size 3 as labeled."
The whole outfit was nice except for the pants.  They were too narrow at the bottom. It was too tight on my daughter. She had a hard time putting her foot thru it. I had to do a small cut. She's pretty slim. I did get her correct size but somehow the pants (the bottom part) was not as expected.
"Mine came tied and it was extremely hard to untie to put on luggage (I mean really really hard to untie). It came scuffed up a tad, the white plus side was stuffed a little, this was not new"
"They are not a ""no show"" thong as they dug into my every part. They say one size fits all but I am normally a size 6 and these were still too small."
"Siggi, please don't label a hat beige when it clearly is not.  What arrived at my house could be called linen or unbleached muslin, but beige it is not.  The product description model in Amazons photo looks 100% better in this hat than I doit fits her head and lays well.  Perhaps it is the placement of the hats two main side seams and the two wires that run throughout the hats brim that make it so weirdly shaped.  No matter which way I bend the brim, the hat looks floppy, ill-fitting and cheap.  I liked the way the polka dots outlined the rim of the hat, and that they're slightly visible (or at least thats the way the description photo makes it look).  My rim shows no glimpse of polka dots, unless the wires are bent upwardsthen I look like a goofy sailor.

I bought this hat for casual outdoor use, but the very light color will get dirty in no time, so I hope it washes up well.  Ill still use it, but overall, this is a very disappointing purchase.  The hats color is not beige and it just doesnt fit well."
"These seem to run small to me. I wear a Large for the Riddell compression shorts (by far the best, in my opinion), but the Large adidas shorts are TINY! I even bought the Extra Large, and those weren't quite as comfortable as the Riddell Large.

The problem with these being so small, is that they cause my soccer shorts to ride up my thighs. I end up constantly pulling these over my thighs, and constantly pulling my soccer shorts off my crotch! This never happens with the Riddell shorts. It's just a shame that I can't seem to find them anymore, so until I do, I'm stuck with these.

EDIT: I found compression shorts made by Champion that are pretty good. Not as good as the Riddell shorts, but much better than these."
"Remember those thick, hefty tees from the 1990s? This is one of them. I could almost use it for a late-fall pull over.

Also, runs small."
"Thought thy would be nicer than this, they are just okay."
This is not cotton but a really gross synthetic material. I will not put this on my child. I have messaged the company for a return but no response yet.
Cheaply made - the bottom crochet started unraveling the first day I wore it.  Very disappointed in the poor craftsmanship!!!
"I guess I cannot be too surprised at the poor quality of these, based on the price. Put one of them on and it broke immediately. Sometimes you find great buys on Amazon despite the low price. But in this case, you get what you pay for-cheap."
THEY PRETTY --- THATS ALL I GAVE THEM AWAY
to small made for a kid don't buy it
"The shoes are beautiful... unfortunately for some reason Ive got an open box product and nobody ask before if it was ok for me to get an open box product when I buy a new product.
The shoes lookes fine and never used, but maybe someone just returned those for the size and thats the product that ive Got."
did not know  I have to wind  it..... junkn
"3x fit like an XL.. Disappointing
word of advise to the seller. try your plus size pieces on a plus size women. I wear a 2x got a 3x thinking it would be more comfortable and I couldn't even pull the darn thing over my butt."
"My watch came and I was so excited to get it. Unfortunately, when I opened it it had silver unreadable numbers not the easy read ones. Needless to say unhappy with getting something not as pictured. Going back sadly."
I spent a while getting these on super excited to hide my post-preganancy belly and my belly looked the same anyways!  Not flattering so it was a waste.  Maybe others had better luck who had a huge belly afterwards but I didn't.
A little to big for a size 13
After one wash the black faded. The two bows on the front are attached by a safety pin. Not very safe for a small baby!
"I returned this purse because it just looked and felt cheap. I wasn't expecting a lot, but it really disappointed me. It has patchwork styled stitching that you can't see in the pictures."
"Handkerchief thin, not flattering."
"I usually skeptical of ordering rings online, this time my skepticism was well deserved! I ordered this to replace the one I lost, in like 48 hours, my finger turned green. I have to have sterling silver, which is in the name, but if you don't see it is Sterling Silver PLATED! so not real silver, the price was great though."
This is not for 0-5 as it states.  The flowers are literally 4.5 inches.  They are bigger than my kids head.  If it was not going to cost me more in shipping to return these than I paid for them in the first place I would return them.  I don't think I will ever use this purchase.
Very cheap and extremely small Im 120 lbs and orders large and its so small
"Didn't feel good on my feet. Did not stabilize well, either."
"This would fit a child, not ""most"" people as described. Shame because they are really funny, but not worth the price if you can't wear them."
a mass printing of the picture and cuts off at the edge. spider good. watch poor.
This shoe is narrow.  Also seems kinda cheap in construction.  I have the more expensive Copas in leather. Those fit much better and my heel doesn't keep coming out of the shoe.
"After two months, the inside soles were dirty and started to stink badly, and they can't be washed. After three months, the soles started separating from the shoe. I can no longer wear them, and I can't return them."
"The photo looks like the bra should provide good support. It does not. It fits okay, but I won't buy it again."
Great price and cute but not made for someone over a C cup in bra size.
"This is a beautiful watch with a very thin profile and a clear dial. However, getting the strap fastened is tricky and takes some getting used to. I am also concerned that this morning (five days after receipt), the watch had stopped at 5:00 am, when I wasn't wearing it. I corrected the time and it appears to be working again, but I'm not sure I can rely on it."
"Will shrink in the wash. And it's not an officially licensed shirt, it's more like a cheap screen print. But hey, it works for a 3 year old."
"A bit large, wish it was a bit more form fitting, then again, perhaps I should have ordered a size smaller!"
not what i expected cotton skirt waist band flips but its ok.
fits high on top of foot and around ankle - returned too snug
"The stitching hurt the joint under my big toe. They were cute, but I had to return them. Also, they run small."
NOT REALLY LONG ENOUGH TO STAY PUT
"very stiff shirt. cute, but very stiff even after washing."
"Very, very thin; but I'll keep them because I don't want to re-order bigger ones or wait for the item to be shipped."
"This night gown is definitely cute and doesn't even really look like pajamas but nothing amazing for the price. It is fitted - I thought it would be more ""flowy"" - It's hard to tell from the pic bc they really only show the top half. But I guess that is what makes it work as a dress or a nightgown. It should work fine as either for me as long as I don't have a c- section (and the baby bump goes a away quickly!) it is low cut which will be great for nursing but I could see why girls with bigger chests wouldn't like just how low it is.  I'm going to keep it as it's cute enough and not worth the hassle of a return even though it's not exactly what I wanted."
I was upset because the shoulder strap was missing and I was unable to use the purse without it due to the event I was going to. Very disappointed.
"Fabric outer shell, not plastic.  I got the brown since it was cheaper, but it seems to have a thin fabric on outside, not plastic.  Wanted plastic since thin fabric may tear easily.  Zoom in you'll see which are plastic which have fabric (lines can be seen).  Wish I'd have zoomed in..."
"Pros
The fit was great especially with average to narrow feet. these were the first EMS boots that I have not been swimming in the toe box.
The tred is great as well as most of the construction.
They Are Water proof!

Cons
Due to how they are laced, the leather creates a gap at the ankle. This is only an aesthetic issue.
These are the most difficult boots I have owned for donning while laced and using the zipper.
Zipper teeth on left boot have become damaged after a couple weeks of wear.
I have not found a way to contact the seller."
Nice but to large
Luggage is smaller that what the picture shows. Will keep the set
"A little snug, but I think they will streach some. No heals so they kind of seem like I am wearing a pair of bedroom slippers. They are comfortable to wear around the house, Nice  and cool."
"Its a lot bigger than I thought it would be, but still really cute. My fianc and I are going to St. Augustine for our honeymoon so this will make a cute beach bag."
"Too large, much larger than I expected.  The backs seem rough."
"So when you first get a pair of these shoes and I have purchased MANY of them; they are the most comfortable shoes on planet earth. That being said, I have sent back as many pairs as I have purchased because it is rare that I get 2 shoes (online) that fit correctly or match in size. One shoe is always much larger. Weird, right! However if you are lucky enough to get a pair that fits right they are amazingly comfortable for about a month.

I call these disposable shoes because they break down in record time. And once they break down there is zero support and man do my feet hurt at that point. Why do I keep buying them... because of that first month. It's like walking on a cloud. I got lucky with this pair because both shoes fit correctly and I love the color so much that I bought them twice!! Skechers has started to make all dark colors and with casual shoes like these; I'm all about a pop of color! I hate to admit that I'm addicted to these short life shoes that would be 5 stars if they lasted longer. Also, as another buyer wrote on the charcoal/pink pair, all of them can get so stinky so fast and I do not have an odor problem either. So I purchase those charcoal bag shoe inserts and I put them in immediately after wearing any of these slip on Skechers and it works!

For more about how the different shoes fit, read my review about the charcoal grey and pink pair of these!"
Ok shirt. I purchased this in red and I'm wishing I would've opted for a classier black. Cute but cheap looking in red.  A little bit on the tighter side too. I sized up and it was a little tighter than I like.  Received this at a discount for my honest review.
Great costume but Returned
"The style and design of the sandals is really cute lace up sandals are the latest fashion for this Spring/Summer 2015. The color blush is really pretty. However the pleather they used is stiff, it cuts into my skin, the laces are also stiff. If you have sensitive skin on your feet these shoes are not for you which is why I give it a 3 star rating. I  sent these back for a refund, glad I  have amazon prime. I  would like this style in really soft pleather or Leather if I can't find this style is soft pleather."
The Mocha was an odd color. Returned them.
"I thought that since these were ""Riggs by Wrangler"", they would fit like a pair of Wranglers.  They don't.  For me, the cut of these pants were just uncomfortable and the waist was to small.  I think the material would have been great, but I couldn't get past how they fit me, so I returned them."
"I don't think this is a great swimming shirt.  The material is more like a quick dry shirt and not a rash guard.  It stretched a lot when it got wet and was very floppy while swimming.  Maybe a size smaller would have worked better.  I'm 6' 175 and the medium was perfect for everyday wearing, but too large for a swim shirt which feels better when it's a little tighter."
"This is a very nice shoe, nice leather,  although initially I felt like they would work, after wearing them in the house for a few hours, my back started to hurt and legs, the foot bed seemed hard, I get heel pain , so always looking for something that won't kill off my heels,  and there a bit wide,  my foot slips around in them with regular thickness socks.  If you don't have wide feet , it would be easy to twist your ankle in them.  for 130.00 dollars I want to feel a bit better about my purchase so there going back.  There very nice though, and the strap I found out is for decorative purposes only I thought I read where u could put it behind the heel ,, I tried but it wouldn't work.  Not too high but still had a little height.  too bad I guess I will keep looking ."
They are short in length. Shorter than expected. Good quality material and looks good
"I had been wanting this dress for a while because it's so cute and I love the style, but I just didn't like the way it fit me so I returned it! I am thin but hippy and the dress shifted up when I walked causing it to pucker at the hips (which only made me look even wider) and then it flared at the bottom which I just really don't like, personally!! I think it's a great dress, just not for me! I definitely recommend buying it though, it was good quality and color and style!!"
"I've had Isotoner slippers before; these are actually replacements for the ones I've worn out after years of use.  These are somewhat different in that they fit well for the entire foot except for the toes.  I guess they are just too narrow at the toes.  The are also nondescript on what foot goes in what slipper.  I've tried them both ways and it seems the same.  The slippers are quality slippers, well made and are padded well.  I  like the velcro closures and open toed slippers."
"The production of good quality, but it is too big, too high."
it very difficult to put on hurt my feet when I wear it not my favorite
This shoe barely had room for my foot to fit in the footbed. It's made really small with too low of a profile.
"The sweater is nice and hangs well. The knit is quite loose and catches easily. Be aware, the picture gave me the impression the sleeves were 3/4 length which I thought was great because I'm not big on long sleeves. However, when I put it on, the sleeves were a full 2 inches past the end of my fingers."
For the price I expected the mask to come with it.
Even the 3 number bigger was way too small. other than that looks nice
Almost sent them back because of the tight fit and the cheaper materials used in this shoe.  Would most likely not buy again.
Very cute but the pants are way too big
I usually buy my boots one size too small because they run big in most cases. I wear an 8 and the 7 was too small. Buying shoes online is so risky I probably won't do it again. I did however get a bigger size and they fit great. Just make sure you get your actual size if buying these
"These are comfortable, but I was expecting more cushion, support and quality. They are comfortable, but I don't think they're supportive enough for long days of walking which is what I am looking for. I wear an 8.5, but ordered a 9 since these don't come in half sizes. The straps fit fine because the back strap is adjustable, but the sole of the sandal was too long. Lastly, they didn't look new. One of the sandals was unbuckled, they weren't packaged neatly in the box, and there was a very noticeable scuff on the leather on one of the toe straps. I don't want to pay this much for sandals and question whether I got a brand new pair or a pair that someone tested out and then returned. And if they were brand new - the quality isn't very good."
More dark than I expected
"This shoe is a beautiful shoe.  Honestly, the picture does not do this shoe justice.  However, there are 2 main reasons this shoe got only 3 stars. First, before you buy this shoe you need to know two things, it runs small (at least a size, maybe a size and half), and the shoe is not for people that do not have skinny feet.  My 10 year old has long, skinny feet.  She wears a size 6 shoe in women, which normally are just a tad bit big.  These shoes were way too small for her feet.  They are not much bigger than my 5 year old's size 2 shoes I ordered (different shoe.)  If you have thicker feet, I would order 1.5 sizes bigger, maybe even 2.  I read reviews that stated they were a bit on the small side, but did not see any reviews saying just how small.  I expected them to be snug, but not this small.  I hope I have saved you the headache I just endured!!!  I gave the shoes 3 stars based solely on how beautiful they are, and how fast they were delivered."
It is a nice dress. Fit is okay but a little smaller than expected in the bust
SOCK WANTS TO ROTATE AROUND MY FEET. PRICE IS GOOD BUT YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. AS LONG AS I HAVE A SHOE ON THEY ARE OK. ALSO VERY THIN ABOVE ANKLE. WILL NOT HOLD UP IN MY OPINION.
"It's cheaply made, but looks nice"
I have owned many they all work well but themacanical watches you can wind a not replace the bat rise all the time
These are different and nice. good color. no washable on machine. are comfy. i really like you receive that you pay.
"The color of this swim set is not the same as what's shown in the display picture; it is orange without the brownish undertone (the color is the reason why I was so eager to purchase this set). I ordered a small, I wish the bikini bottom were a bit tighter and the bikini top covered my nipples properly. [i'm 5'6"" and i'm about 150lb with a 34B bra size]. Overall I like this swim set. I would've given it 5 stars if the color were hat I was expecting, the bikini bottom were tighter and the bikini top didn't expose part of my nipples."
"I have a lot of expectations for Stila products and this was just ""m'eh"". I liked the tip, but it doesn't moisten easily and it grabs the skin. I use basic inkwell stuff that are easier to apply."
"I have back problems, so I need shoes with good support.  I've been very happy with my 2 previous purchases of Merrells and have worn them almost daily.  The toe strap doesn't seem very sturdy, so I'm torn as to whether it's the fit of this style or if I should return them."
"I bought this for my wife thinking the ""Turkish Cotton"" would be super-soft terry cloth. Not so. The robe smelled like gun powder when it arrived and was about as soft as a scouring pad. My wife said not to worry, it would soften up when it got washed. It did, --- a little!"
a little tight but a good buy
"Love Saucony, but these hurt my feet the minute I put them on."
"I bought this for my trendy 5 year old hoping for greatness, the outfit fell short of my expectations but gave 3 stars because it was so inexpensive. The size 5-6 top fit her very well however the letters faded after only the first wash and continue to fade every time I wash it. The skirt hasn't been worn because it is way to big, seems like the skirt and top were from 2 differently sized outfits. Also the skirt looks a lot more dressy compared to the top."
"Very high waste, and quite large, but they can be cinched. Really good fit in the legs (for a slim child). Soft and stretchy material."
great shoes but the size nine fit like a ten with heavy socks on i have sent them back.
"Good fabric, seems like it would hold up well. Definitely a cargo cut with wide legs. I returned it as the ""Romeo 6 pocket Flare"" bottoms I ordered were a more flattering fit."
The shoes look good and are well constructed but slip on my feet when I walk
"Wish they were still making the ORIGINAL which is sturdier, more attractive and easier to remove. Bought the newer version as backup since the originals are starting to wear at the heel and beginning to delaminate. For now I use this newer pair as house slippers. ""Original design"" is just a clever marketing term as far as I'm concerned."
I've been a fan of Pumas for years because I have narrow feet. These Match 74's fit a bit wider than my other Pumas.
"this was the most economical choice so i knew going in that there was a chance of dissatisfaction, but i was also not sure how well an ultrasonic cleaner would work for my purposes (glass nails). was positive i needed at least a 30 minute cycle and after 45+ cycles so far, i am also very happy with the almost daily use results.

however, part of the plastic frame cracked over the weekend and the only reason could be vibration from the machine itself.

not sure if it is going to be unusable soon, but 3 stars is ok if it works through the end of this year"
Supposed to be extra wide. They're not! Seem to be on the very narrow width. Bummer. Will give away.
arms were too short and had to return.
Great fit but there were some asthetic flaws. The shoe was new but there were some marks on the leather that were not removable and noticable enough to take away from the shoe.
"I usually wear size 0. I got small in this. The fit is ok on the shoulders and hip, but quite relaxed around the waist. I thought it looked shaped online, but it's a very straight cut. Ok for weekends. Not as dressy as i had hoped"
These run a bit more narrow than some of the other brands I have purchased in wide. They look nice but could have been a bit wider.
this shoe was a little tight. also i didn't know it was shiny .. i don't like shiny shoes. but i still kept them.
"After wearing these around the house they began to press in on my ankle of one foot. I knew this would only get worse, so they had to go back. Nicely constructed and warm with good support."
"I like the weight, and look, but the zippers are hard to operate(over the corners) and the storage is minimal at best."
Too hard to replace battery.
"It came with a failure, the watch stops, having the seconds stick going back and forward, back and forward.
I would like upload a video, how can I do it here?"
"I needed a shirt for my husband to wear to a wedding and it's very hard to find one his size (18X32/33).  The neck was alright, but the body was very big.  It worked ok for his suit, and it was just ok."
The sandals are ok. Not supper comfortable. The material makes my feet sweat. They fit a bit tight.
Too narrow for my feet ...  returned them...
Nice tee but runs small
the chain or rope is to little
"All three shirts in the package had several loose threads around the neck area which had to be trimmed.  One shirt came with a small hole in the front about the size of a small pea.  Looked like a snag or something.  Shirts fit well before washing, after washing they shrink quite a bit."
Beach cover up use only
"The arch support is very off.  The shoe attracts dirt and cannot be cleaned off. I love Asics, but this is my least favorite."
"When I ordered this i didn't expect it to be soo stretchy and it turned out to be way too big. One cannot return it and extra shipping is added, and though it could have been perfect if in Medium, still---highhprice---and it don't fit!"
The sandal is comfortable but does not have the arch support like other Cobb Hill shoes.
"Cute and served it's purpose, but already falling apart at the seams."
"Though sized as narrow, these shoes were no narrower than a normal medium width shoe. They were sent back."
Color exactly as shown. No support at all for me (c or d cup). I was overflowing the pushup cups so much so I had to keep adjusting. I'll definitely not be wearing this bra.
these shoes are very large. I couldn't return it because I live in south korea.
Very comfortable lightweight material but cut on the small size.  Order up two sizes at least.
The elastic band holding the shoe in place will eventually wear out and will cause your shoe to slip off which is not good when working in a busy restaurant.
"I loved these so much when they arrived I ordered 2 more pairs but like some of the other reviews, after I wore them once or twice they began to form holes along the seems in the butt area. They are so soft and comfy but if you can only wear them once or twice before they fall apart then not worth the money."
The piece between toes hurt.  Returned these shoes.  They are really cute.  Wanted to keep them but to me they just were not comfortable.
Probably should have bought higher quality boot to get more comfortable fit....
"I have a narrow foot and the ankle strap was only partially adjustable thus making them not fit was well and look odd.  there was""t enough arch supportnto be worn more than a few hours"
"These boots are cute, I've been wearing them a few weeks now.  The fit is fine, there is room for a heavier pair of socks.  However they are cheaply made.  I don't think there is any leather on these boots.  I'll be surprised if they last the season.  I got a good deal over the holidays but wish I would have saved my money for a better quality pair.  I have bigger calves and these were very roomy.  I still have plenty of room to wear them over jeans."
Not what I thought I was buying.
"small, shrunk when washed - not true to sizing. great material"
"It took two tries to get the correct size, but finally did. The first ones ran a little small."
Little bigger but good to use it.
"Though I'm height/weight proportionate, 5'7 and 135lbs, I am not toned so I always wear shape wear ro make my body look more toned and help my clothes hang smoothly. I have every brand out there (or so it seems) from Spanx, Suddenly Slim, Yummie Tummie,  Hanes, Jockeys, Bali and Maidenform.

The problem with shape wear is that it almost always flattens you out on top. This one is no exception. I've tried buying shape wear with built-in bras, but those never work out either because the cup size rarely matched the size of the shape wear. For example, I might want a size Small or 4-6 in the shape wear, but I need larger than a 34A in the bra. If I choose one that has a bra that fits, the camisole part is too big and/or too loose.

This camisole shape wear has a  unique aspect in that it can be worn as a scoop top or v-neck style. But it runs loose, it doesn't really provide any additional shaping than you'd get wearing a tank too. I could have gone down a size, of course  but that will make the smashing in the chest area even worse.  And since it offers zero support in the bra area, you'll still have to wear a bra under.

If you're looking for something very light and relatively loose to wear under clothing that might catch or ride up, you're probably going to  like this ok if you can get it in the fifteen dollars range. I gave this 3 stars because it's not shape wear, it's more like a firmer camisole but at shape wear pricing."
"It is what it is. Its a cheap but good looking watch. I didn't expect it to be the best quality and neither should you. I work at a desk lall day so I don't really run into the problem of scratching the face but if you work outside or anything then this watch will definitely get scratched up, quickly."
I wish there was more flexibility in the sole of the shoe.  I have worn Merrells for years but prefer the lighter weight more flexible ones.  Not sure if I am going to keep them yet.  I would prefer a higher arch since I was a former professional dancer and have high arches.  No problems with arch support for most people I am sure.
"These are nice and long and pretty soft.  I have a 34"" inseam and my mid-thigh measures 24"" around...I'm a big girl.  These fit fine.  I could pull them all the way up my leg and the bottom is still covering my heel.  They do not stay up though.  They are not a tight enough knit. There is not any kind of elastic cuff at the top to hold them there.  I haven't tried them over leggings, just on my bare legs.  I might consider them for around the house, or to wear to bed, but I'm pretty sure they won't work for under pants, which is why I bought them."
"I bought this because of what others had written about the great fit.  Well, on me it doesn't give nearly enough lift and support to ""the girls,"" plus the back creeps up.  The front band could be more rigid so it doesn't fold over.  Overall, I would NOT purchase this again."
"Although I really like the stye of this ring...one of the crystals fell out in less than a year.  Also, if you are not use to wearing a ring with a design around the full band it may feel bulky and irritating."
"Not very comfortable. My feet hurt after wearing these for just a couple hours, even after a break-in period."
"You get what you pay for. A truly good suit is a pricy endeavour, this will help until then. It's worth it if everything goes smoothly,  customer service is poor."
I wish they made the old dry socks still.
"I bought the ""bodacious purple"" version for my wife's birthday. We like to travel and she likes to lose her passport. This thing is pink, not purple at all. She might still like it but I was planning ahead and it's still not her birthday. Vendor really wants a review so here it is. I'll update in a few weeks on her reaction."
Fun for what it is...knocking off.
"Great arch support, cute, and all around comfortable. Unfortunately, like other customers, I too found the heels of the sandals falling apart after wearing them for a month. Amazon graciously provided a replacement, so hopefully this second set will last longer!"
"Runs a bit small.  Must be willing to ""break in"".  The jeans are sitting in my closet.  Not certain when i will wear them."
gave to my friend way too long for me these are for big and tall i think
Returned them.  They were very stiff too.
not exactly how is in picture. the top is not metallic its knitted pink and it was a bit big
I bought these for my husband. The sole on one of the shoes is falling apart. Its literally splitting in half.
"Save your money and get iLoveSIA(R) Women's Maternity Nursing Bras, they are identical just not as expensive, for the cost you can have 3.  That straps inside the bra keep popping out on sides, as they are very thin and loose."
"This shirt actually fits me really well, I'm usually a size large and ordered their biggest size. So just keep that in mind when ordering this item, you have to go up a bunch of sizes... Shipping took a month which kinda sucked, but when it came I forgot all about so it was a surprise when it did finally show up. Material is strong, it has a feminine fit, and again fits perfectly if you order it 3 or 4 times bigger than what you would wear. I'll probably order another one now knowing that it does fit, as some of these international sellers are a hit or miss. This one was actually a hit. Glad I ordered it in the size I did!"
Haven't worn yet -- no sun or beaches trip just yet this year. She tried it on and it seems fine. She's into Dora right now so it works
Seems to be the real thing but my taurus does not have the alex and ani print on the back... but it looks great anyway...
"This purse is pretty and a good size. Unfortunately, the quality is not great. The first time, I ordered a black one and upon receiving the bag, the material looked cheap. I exhanged it for a red one, in hopes that it would appear better. The second purse I recieved, arrived with a broken zipper.
I exchanged it AGAIN! Let's see what the third one loosk like."
I ordered 2 sizes larger than I normally wear and it was still way to small.
I give it a three-star because I had to return it. I have a low Arch and it has too much Arch. Lots of room in the forefoot and color is Vivid and true!
"I love the bag, could use another netted area in the back or outside of the bag but it holds all my stuff. I just doesn't fit in my locker, its about 4 inches longer than the average locker space.

Other than that, I love it."
It was shipped quickly. The dress is not as brightly colored as the picture. The material isn't silky or light so it doesnt really flow or move. We ordered a large for my daughter who is 57 about 155lbs and it is a bit large in the waist and top. We will keep it and get it to a tailor but I don't think Ill order another one
"somewhat large had to add another insole
also needs more cusion at the ball of your feet
i do like the style of the shoes thats why i gave them 3 stars"
Very narrow across bridge of foot. Rest almost too big. You would need an unusual shaped foot to fit right
I was so pleased to finally find this slip on!  Just wish it had a little more of a heel and that it didn't rub the top of my foot.  I will just get some moleskin patches and keep it moving.
"They run very small, but I love the feeling of the fabric. They are super comfy."
Thin and the small was too big for me.
"These shoes are very cute and I wanted to love them but the elastic band around the ankle allows your foot to slip and the strap across the toes is too loose so the foot slips down.  This probably would not an issue with a shorter heel, which I do not believe would have affected the cute look.  Sadly, they were returned."
They were a little cheap. I've had them about 2 months and a little bit is chipping.
"The color is darker than the photo; a little more olive too.  It is advertised as machine washable, but the tag says dry clean only, so marks off for that."
"It was a bit larger and thicker than I was expecting, but the company contacted me right away to make amends.  I appreciated that very much.  But on the negative side, it is a bit of false advertisement as it shows a young woman wearing it as quite well fitted and looks like thin cotton type shirt.  This material is closer to almost a flannel material. Buyer be aware."
Order up for a baggy fit; denim weight is medium weight with a little stretch.  Some fabric discoloration in spots.
I bought a L. IM 5'2 170 and it's too big.
"Chain is so short I can barely get it around my neck. The stone itself is lovely, but I am going to have to buy a new chain before I can wear it. Even my teenage granddaughter had trouble wearing it because the chain is so short."
"Fits to size, except the boob part is kinda weird and doesn't stay closed so you have to pin it."
"I love that the sandal is very comfortable for walking however, I do wish that they had a half size. I wear regular size 6 and I ordered size 6 and I can tell it's half inch bigger. I thought about replacing with size 5 then my toe would fall off. I really wish they had size 5.5 to fit perfectly."
Cute style with lots of cushioning but I had to return them because I have a high instep and the top was a little too snug for my foot.
"The pattern was cute and the fabric was nice but gosh was it small, fit me like a shirt. Was tight around the hips, I ordered a large and its still tight and I usually wear L or XL depending on brand. I am 5 foot 8 and its like a shirt on me."
"Had to return and order a smaller size, which cost twice as much.  What luck."
"This review will have mixed emotions. First, the watch arrived, running when I unpacked it, which was a good thing. Second, it's lovely...very well-finished, has a nice leather strap, the watch looks high-quality and rich, like a million bucks. It also has a nice heft. On appearance alone I'd give it 5 stars. There is lots of nice detail in this watch.

The watch is gorgeous, runs, it keeps nearly perfect time, it would be perfect if not for one small detail.

Both of the little ""day and month"" hands (the ones at the 9 and 3 o'clock positions) were missing. There are shafts there, but the assembler must have simply forgotten to attach the pointer hands.

I contacted the seller and they immediately apologized, and offered to refund my money and shipping. All is well there, it gives me a good feeling and confidence in them.

So yes, First impression...I love the watch, I simply wish those small hands were there. I may try buying a second one hoping for better luck."
"It's okay for ""play time"" but not daily wear as I'm too large chested for it to be flattering."
"PROS:
nice mid-rise
perfect length if you like a ""just below the knee"" capri
extra fabric in the crotch

CONS:
thin fabric
leg bottoms are super tight!

Found these capris very ""meh,"" especially for Jockey.

I'm 5""5"", long wasted, 140 lbs, wear a medium,/8-10.

Pros:  I did like the mid-rise;  they weren't so high wasted that they were at the belly button (hate that!) but they weren't so low that you would be constantly hiking them up to prevent muffin top.  Like other Jockey leggings, there is additional material sewn into the crotch, which definitely enhances the fit.  I also liked the length witch hits just below the knee on me.

Cons:  The biggest con with these leggings is the super tight bottom where the legging meets your calf.  I do have very large and muscular calves so this issue was a deal-breaker for me.  If you have lovely sleek lower legs, or are very slim, they might work for you.

I was disappointed with the quality of the fabric, it was quite thin.  Even in black, I would be uncomfortable wearing these to the gym, although they would be fine under a skirt or tunic.  The little waistband pocket that Jockey includes in other leggings is also missing in this design.  I'm surprised at the lack of quality as other Jockey leggings I have are very well made."
This dress looks pretty but unfortunately fits very snug. Like at least 1 size too small. Had to return.
"High quality? Absolutely. But...

The handle needs to be larger and/or repositioned. The blades don't touch the skin between my knuckles. In other words, it doesn't look like the blades are coming out of my hand. I can do some custom fabrication but it isn't optimal. Also the blades are all evenly spaced and straight. It would be better if they were slightly pointed away from each other at the tips.

Otherwise pretty good."
"As ever, delivery was spectacular.
Pros: Body cut is good, stitching is good,
Cons:  Its cotton fabric is rough even after a good wash.  I normally wear 17 inch regular dress shirts which is the equivalent of this XL shirt.  However, this product seems to have the sleeves of the 'long' cut, the cuffs of the 'XXL' work shirt.  I have to keep the sleeves rolled almost all time."
"Seem like ok shoes. The memory foam feels nice, but not much of an arch support under the foam. They will be returned  due to that. I have incredibly flat feet and even for walking I need arch support. They felt pretty wide in the toe, too. I have a wider toe area and the rykas I purchased felt too snug. I'm going with New Balance Vazee rush as they felt the most accurate."
"i love these glasses they are perfect, i only ran into one issue with them and noticed it a little late but that the metal part that connects the 2 lenses was snapped when i received it"
"I wanted to like this, especially since it's so stylish and I love Kate spade. But I found it to not be as accurate as I was expecting. See my attached pictures...

Pros: small profile and cute design. Comfortable and easy to wear.

Cons: instruction book was in the smallest font imaginable. The features are pretty limited and inaccurate.

You can track your steps, sleep, glasses of water, and exercise minutes, or set a custom goal. There are some other options like remote camera shutter and make your phone ring remotely.

I did a test to see how the step and sleep tracker worked. I'm a nursing mother to a 7 month old and typically get up twice a night. Last night I went to bed at 11pm, got up once at 2:30, and then was up for the day at 6:30am. The step tracker calculated my trip to the nursery and back twice (I checked this first thing in the morning) to be almost 100 steps. I measured it out and one trip should only be about 25 steps. It also said I only slept for 4.5 hours, which seems odd because I fell right asleep at 11pm, woke up at 6:15, and was only up with the baby once for about 15 minutes.

Overall, it's something I would probably return if I could. I wish there was a clock feature in here somewhere, especially for the price point. If it looks like a watch, at least tell me the time, right?"
"I buy these a lot for under my tennis skirt. Because I wear and wash them a lot, they don't last long, the hems come undone. I love them though and they are the right length, very white and comfortable."
"As I stated in my other Reviews, I bought three versions of these before realizing the fit was too snug around the middle area. Squatting is the worst because of this. Haggar makes quality clothing, however."
"Received these bras in the post today.  The colours are very nice...the fit, not so nice.  I wear a 36C and found these bras snug where the Coobie band rests.  The cup's fit is a bit pointy at the ends and doesn't cup the breasts snugly as they should for sport bras.  I will keep them because these cons do not affect the look when they are worn under tops.
The price for these 6 sports bras is hard to beat, which is why I can accept the way they fit.  As stated earlier, despite their fit, they look fine under my garments and the snugness around the band is tolerable to bare."
I'm giving it 3 but could be less. I'm trying to be reasonable here for others. For me it's a 2 simply because the reset button has changed. My old timex ironman 30 lap watch you would have to hold the reset on the timer to actually reset it with a delay. This was great just Incase you were unaware you stopped the timer. Now if you're unaware you stopped the timer and press it stop once the time will reset very quickly. I officiate sports and sometimes you can press stop twice by accident. If that happens your timer will go back to reset. So I would always need to keep an eye on the time and not the sport. For officiating this watch doesn't cut it like the others. The other functions are fine and I do like the Velcro. Shame they changed the reset option.
"its nice a little see through but my husband liked it  , the only thing is that its a little small im 165 pds 5'8 and it keeps riding up"
Unfortunately I cannot feel this item provide enough support.
"I bought this as a gown for my daughter for a good friend's wedding. According to the sizing, it should have been down to the floor on her but when I tried it on her it only went to her ankles (which I didn't like or want). Aside from that, the flower on the dress fell off! It did come with a beautiful headband which was a pleasant surprise since it was not stated in the item description."
It fits really weird and is dress length mostly. It's also tight up top in the chest and too big everywhere else. Not buying this again
Fits and was relatively inexpensive so I'm keeping it.  I have not worn to the pool yet.  But the quality could be a little better. (See picture.  This is the top strap so is very visible.)
"It is not the best for swimsuits, but if put in any kind of bra it definitely gives and extra size or two! They are noticeable to the one wearing it but its not a bad thing. Its squishy and cool and fits pretty much A-C sizes"
"Gorgeous robe. Great color great embroidery  actually more designs than I expected.  But it does run small. I'm 5' 6"". 165 lbs. an it just makes it  Otherwise. A great robe"
They're ok. Trendy but uncomfortable fit. Meh
"Too stiff..not soft, cozy cotton.."
"As other reviewers have mentioned, this is a thin material. I purchased the largest size expecting it to be a bit too small, and for it to be sheer because of how much I had stretched it. I'm about a size 18-20 and it actually fit fairly well, but it is a bit sheer in the rear.

However I bought these to lounge around the house in, or do yoga at the gym with a tunic-style shirt, so I'm not worried so much about it being see-through.

I am sad, though, knowing that these are not going to last for a very long time. While they are INCREDIBLY comfortable, they are thin and tend to pill where they rub together. I love these pants, but I'm only rating them a 4 star because they're too expensive for how often I'll have to replace them."
"Fit was great, but strap way too long."
for been 9.5 is very big
Okay so I got 3X but it didn't fit like a 3X should it was tight beware that it runs small.
Not crazy about the material.  Huge wrinkle factor - even after ironing.  Not a bad product - just not my style.
"Like the shoe, not the fit."
comfortable except for in between the big toe for long periods
"Looks great but link broke after normal non-sporty use.  However, the manufacturer sent a replacement that I am told is in transit.  Great customer support!"
"I bought three beach dresses from Sakkas. All of them are beautiful and fit me well, so I gave 5 stars at the first glance. But then I saw that two of them had an added fabric like a mending patch at the left end of the dresses. This is one of them, so I changed it to 3 stars. I have many dresses the same style bought from other countries, they don't have any mending patches like this. I think Sakkas wanted to have it produced cheaper. If you don't mind it, you can buy it because the dress is beautiful."
Socks are very thin.
"I wanted to like this shoe, because it's assembled in the USA and seems to be of very good quality.  However, the styling wasn't quite what I hoped it would be - it looked a little plain and outdated - and the fit was very narrow.  I do suspect that my feet may be a little wider than I think they are, so I cannot blame the shoe completely.  However, even when tied, the gap between the eyelets was very large and made my feet look stubby.  I ended up returning them after I tried them on.

Despite my criticisms, this shoe has a lot going for it.  The outer sole and insole are both excellent. The leather is very nice, and It felt like it would be a comfortable shoe if fitted correctly.  I just didn't like the styling enough to try another size."
Ok item for what I need it for.
"Not as comfortable a fit for one with a large head as described on the website.  I've since given it to a friend with a smaller cranium, and he's quite delighted.  So, as they say, it's all good."
The boobs are just too big on this suit =(
"I bought a Dansko Dee first, and I liked it.  This shoe is very firm, the sole is not soft the the newer models, but it's still comfortable. First I thought they are easy too loose,  so I cut up the highest strip but how that I've made it tighter it's too tight :(. They look good though, I mean the top,  but the bottom looks a bit grannyish.  dansko could seriously look a bit more youthful.  I want to buy healthy shoes that look contemporary."
Fits great unless you have a smaller breasts. In that case it makes them appear flat. It's a nice color and the materials nice.
not so much large but a little wide
I just wish it was a little longer for us taller people. I got a 2x assuming it'd fit me lengthwise. But still is short.
Bad color choice for me. Will return for different color & maybe go up a size.
Bought a larger size thinking this product runs small..it was a bit big..so bought the correct size and it fits perfect
"I'm disappointed in this shoe. While it fits well, there does not appear to be any leather in the upper at all. I always counted on K-Swiss for leather uppers, but it seems they've gone the way of cheap china products. I might as well, buy a cheap Walmart shoe for $20."
"I purchased these looking for more comfortable work boots. Alas, these are not work boots. They are more of a ""fashion"" boot. Somewhat comfortable, but returned."
"They are bulky, and even with a silk liner they aren't as warm as SmartWool Extra Heavy socks.  I ride horses outside all winter so a warm sock is essential, and I hate toe warmers."
"I love this shirt, (silky t-shirt material, stretcy but soft) but I'm very curvy, and it just clung to my figure the wrong way.  I wanted a loose tunic fit.  Thus I need to get a larger size - large or maybe extra large.  I gave the shirt to my daughter, who is 14 and much less curvy  - it looks wonderful on her!
 I considered exchanging it, but interestingly, there was no packing slip or return options in the box.  I did not pursue returning it through Amazon, since my daughter is keeping the shirt...but just be careful when you order.  The fit will run smaller than expected, and you may have trouble returning or exchanging."
"Material different than what I wanted,  a little larger than I needed, but comfortable !!!!!"
"These tee shirts run slightly larger than their white crew neck counterparts, or at least the group I received does.  The neck sizes are definitely larger than I would expect from a medium tee shirt."
"Very nice and decent quality for the price, but very small around the torso. I even sent it back and exchanged for an ex-large but that fit exactly the same."
"The back of shoe rubs ankle terribley, too stiff. I've owned many boat shoes since the 80s. None have had to take two years to break in still not able to wear them without socks."
"I got this as a birthday gift, per my wish list and I have to say I was quite disappointed.  It is not very flattering...it made me think of an inmate jumpsuit - the fabric is rough, it is baggy, the shorts are very long (not as pictured) and over all it just looked like a potato sack on me.  I ordered my regular size but it seems too baggy - maybe if it were a smaller size might help but even then, there's just no ""cuteness"" to it so I am going to return it."
Super cute. Pretty large for the size.
Order a size down.  Ok to wear around the house
"The clipper, nail file, and tweezers are a nice stainless steel. The slanted tweezers work well.  They grasp the hair and pull it from the root instead of just breaking it.  The nail file is wonderful.  One side is coarse and the other side is fine.  Both sides work extremely well to shape and seal nails.

The nail clipper, on the other hand, is a bit flimsy and hard to open.  It's also made of stainless steel, but it's so thin that its difficult to cut your nails. Unfortunately, the design is great but it falls short on functionality.  I find that it slips out of place.  I have long nails and I bent one of them when the nail clipper slipped out of position.  I won't be using it again.  I'll stick with my Trim nail clipper.

I wouldn't recommend this manicure set, unless you have very thin and fragile nails, especially at the current price of $99."
Style is great but the feather trim around the wrists and ankles was not secure.  I have had to repair and re-anchor it after each wearing.
Love the length the pockets are a little crazy but there are plenty of them. the waist is a little small.
"Very cute by very weird, it my just be the shape of my head. I haven't been able to wear any because I don't like how they look. The knot on the top of my head doesn't work very well, I tried the other way with it underneath but then there's a seam."
The jeans seem nice but the waist was somewhat small.
This is alittle on the large size for my head. Doesn't fit like my current one that I bought years ago. Disappointing.
"Fit as expected, but to thin for me because Im use to wearing a thick cotton underwear. Its just me though"
"I ordered my size and a 1/2 size larger.  My size seemed a little short in the last (arch to ball of foot).  However, the larger size had a big lump by the zipper on the left boot AND, the left boot seemed to be made entirely of belly leather, so it didn't really match the right one.  Belly leather is thinner, wrinklier and pebblier than body leather.  Since the Chinese eat so much pork, one would think they would have enough pig leather (which is what these boots are made of and the leather is quite thin, overall) to avoid using the inferior part of the leather at all.  The other boots also had belly leather and not in the best place - the foot part of the boot.  However, given the price and the fact that I won't wear them nearly as often as I do regular shoes and boots, I opted to keep the pair that are my size.  I have pretty skinny legs - I can't imagine an athletic calf fitting into these boots, but they do look great on and I really like the wedge heel."
"Comfy but, didn't seem to have Hanes quality."
Paper thin just like all this name dresses. It's okay. THIN THIN
Comfortable although being a little large.
"I bought two shirts, this one and a purple one. The purple one fit, but this one was too tight. Both were the same size."
Nice art work just fits a little small.
"I liked the color of these shoes and the fabric they are made of seems soft, flexible and breathable but they were way too narrow!
I had to return them"
"I got the packs for my family. I think they will like them. My only complaint is when they arrived, they smelled like cigarette smoke. Gross! The bags and box they came in stunk like a chain smoker trying to get cancer! That will be a big turn off for my family."
"I have several Thanth products. This item fits a little smaller than the others I have.  Fortunately I picked up on this in reviews prior to ordering so got the right size. I was hoping for a white shirt that wasn't completely see through. This is not it. The shirt itself would probably be fine in a darker color, but I needed white. I am keeping the shirt because I still need a white top, but this will require wearing something under it."
"Boots are soft and very cute, unfortunately they are not meant for plus size women with larger ankles and calves. A shame but I will have to return them."
odd memory foam support... i like the rubber sole Crocs inserts better
"Would rate higher, but bought two pair and one of the slippers had a hole on the toe. I whip-stitched it closed, and am satisfied. These things happen. Nice footbed cushioning. Very comfy, very cute, nice to see them at the door at the end of a hard day."
"Had to return them.  Too large.  Must run big because I ordered the size of shoes I normally wear.  The box said, ""Mens"" but the invoice said, ""Women's"" so I don't know but returned them and ordered a different pr.  The insole is rough and hard on your feet.  I didn't want to wear socks w/them."
"I am a women's true eight, but the size chart and other reviews, I got the 6. but it was way too big. instant return. not cute enough to warrant an exchange.  I have wide feet and like tight shoes. but this was like a long. skinny oval flipper.  I like their other shoe more. which I did keep and will exchange."
"For the most part I like it, I can organize a decent size of my jewelry while traveling. The only thing is dislike is the section for the necklace.  The necklace section is not convenient because they dangle the necklaces don't stay in place."
I am returning because they are too small
Look great. Elastic wears out quick.
Fit is as expected and price was good
I really like this fanny pack however the smell of either the leather or the treatment of this leather was really overpowering. I have it hanging to rid the strong odor but it is still pretty strong. Much better than when I opened up the package. I am hoping that it will fade away soon so I can wear it. I figure if I can smell it then anyone around me will also smell it. Other than the smell I really like this fanny pack.  Thank you.
"Bought these for my girlfriend and she was a little disappointed. The gray, or any colored ""fur"" is different from the regular UGGS ""fur"" - It's much more coarse, not soft & fluffy like the standard light tan color fluff. We originally thought they were counterfeit because it was so different. They also don't offer half sizes so she got a size 7, much too big for her size 6 1/2 foot, sent them back and got a 6, now they're a little tight. They broke in a little but not enough to be really comfortable."
Good material and quality. Just too narrow.
When will Timex think about putting a rotating bezel on simple watch?
Bought a small
"one size fits all is huge lie. at 90 lbs, i have altered 10 pair purchased here. will these when they fit. nice pattern does not look like snake (glad)."
Fit well and were comfortable.  Looked a bit frumpy on.
"I had the fishing boot version prior to this one and that model was easier to slip into, but had full/half sizing, so the fit was not as tailored. This boot feels great"
The measurement size was probably accurate but the arch support seemed off from where it needed to be under my foot and the toe width is too tight. I wish I had gone up half a size from the recommendation.
This will have to be worn with shorts. Each color is a separate panel and not sewn together. Not what I expected but still very cute.
"It's very pretty, and feels like good quality, but just taking it out of the packaging, it's WAY too small.  I used the sizing chart on the page, and it's not even CLOSE to the size it is supposed to be.  Comes from China, and their sizes are a lot different from US sizing. Just keep that in mind.  I have to return it for a refund, although I had having to do so."
"They are okay, just thought they were sterling silver"
The bracelet is short. I returned the watch.
"They are kind of curved in the middle and it feels like they make me walk funny. BUt they also felt like they had been worn before, even though I don't think they had been. Was probably just a fluke. 1 shoe was tight, and they other one was pretty loose, like it had been stretched."
"I have a bigger-than-normal head. Unfortunately, these did not fit my face. They're cute though! They also look very alien-esque. They're really neat-looking!"
"I'm a size 12 and while I could tie this around my waist, there wasn't much room left over for the draped look.  I also couldn't make it work more than one way due to the small size.  The quality was very nice, but if you're larger than a 12 on the bottom, I'd find a different sarong."
"its ok, but a bit small"
"material is very thin, but looks fine when you are wearing them. An added bonus is they will fir easily into my suitcase for vacation!"
Got 1 size larger than normal and still a snug fit. Made in China !
"This dress is decent quality, pretty clingy in the back.  I wear an 18/20 and got the  2x.  Hides the tummy, would be cute with or without leggings, not as flattering in the back as I had hoped, pretty clingy and revealing.  Is stretchy so I may work with it."
"Satisfaction regular.
Thanks.
Enrique."
"These are the only Keens I've had (3 pair so far) that have held up over time. These are great for slipping on and taking the dog out for example, or if you want they're not bad for general usage either. I've found them to be dry and comfortable, though I think it's worth noting they offer less support than the typical Keen that I have tried in the past."
"These shoes are cute but they are cheaply made. When they finally arrived they had glue on the inside of the soles (as if the sole was glued prior to shipping). I was able to wipe away the excess glue but image glue being on the inside of your shoe (gross).  Aside from that they are okay (shipping extremely slow, took over a month to arrive). Pretty comfortable so far."
Very Pretty but too darn long! This necklace is very nice but it's so long and i took it to a jeweler whom said no links could be taken out. So i was unable to wear it at all cause it slips off your wrist. I would of returned it but was unaware about the link issue.
this purse smells when I go it but is nice
Cute but way too small.  Not true to size.
Material's a bit too small
"These are relatively cute and they get the job done, but I would only wear them at the beach or pool. The ankle straps are a weird rubber material so they rub against the skin in a very uncomfortable way. They also get very dirty and stained easily."
"Adorable, but fit was way too smal.  Had to return."
"Cute color, just as pictured. Weird fit. The bust is very small everywhere except the band is ridiculously loose and may as well not be there due to total lack of support. The rest is extremely loose, and floats up constantly."
Much better than ones I bought at Target but still just too short on heel and always end up slipping off heel. Maybe no show is just not meant for me. But they seem to go on fine and then slip down almost instantly.
Terry Cotton is nice and soft. The sole is rather light and flimsy.
"The bra came on the date that was set. It's a pretty bra, but I think they sacrificed some comfort for aesthetic appeal. I don't recommend this bra to those with sensitive skin, it can get itchy.

Overall, I'm happy with this bra. It's a great fit."
There are little on the right side.
Ordered a large because I'm a medium but still to small. Great service but this item runs small unless you are very slim.
"This is a tight, short dress. I was expecting something a little more flow."
not as comfortable as I expected it to be. I have heel pain and the CROCS sandals that I use does not put pressure on my heel so I thought this flip flops would be the same way. I thought wrong! 30 minutes into wearing it and I was ready to take it off!
"Got this for my mom for her birthday and it was a really good price and pretty too but she doesn't wear it much, doesn't want to ruin it."
"I don't usually buy clothes on Amazon but these looked cute. They fit ""ok"" but a bit baggy around the thighs"
It is made of very cheap material and very thin. The cuffs are not finished so they roll and stretch out. It's a cute top but i don't see it lasting a long time. Worth price paid.
The top is extremely short...
"These would have been great except they were huge. Silver Jeans are amazing, but it's getting harder to order from them as their sizing seems to be all over the place."
They're very pretty but hit the back of the heel in anodd place making it uncomfortable to wear for long walks
It for sure does not look like it does in the photo. But still kinda cute
These were not my favorite from the maker. Colors don't really look as good as pictured. Wish other colors were avail at the time. Might have worked out.... Shoes Tim a bit wide all around.
These shoes are super cute. They have a nice thick memory foam foot bed which is nice but they are impossible to break in! I ordered a half size up and I have to wear bandages on the back of my heels every day because they rub the skin off my heels! I want to love them and maybe that will stop but I've worn them 4 days so far (10 hous per day) and they still hurt
"The sizes are a little off.  The one I got hung like a rag, so I sent it back.  I will try another top in a different style."
My husband is your average medium with lean trim hips.  He said this was snug at the hips.
Not a fan of the hood and the way it sat. Always had this awkward fabric thing going on on the sides.
"Doesn't look the same in person as the picture. I will donate it to charity. It's not ugly, it's just not as great as it appears in the photo."
"If you look in the description, it says Color: Gray. Wrong. It's construction yellow. With lots of blood spatter.
The sound effects start out with a chainsaw buzz, then there are some odd muffled screams, then it shuts off.
The button is a tiny black one toward the top of the round silver diagonal handle on the back. Hard to see."
Cheaply made. We returned and splurged for a PBK suitcase.
"This was my bridesmaid dress for my sister's wedding. My other sister (middle in the 3 person photo) ordered the same exact one as well as the 3rd bridesmaid (left in the 3 person photo). I'm on the right in that photo as well as the unblurred one in the other 2 photos for reference.

- The left bridesmaid's dress rode up a bit and her fabric was a little awkward. I'm not sure if she altered hers or when it arrived.
- The my sister (middle)'s dress arrived quickly, but her bust area rode up as well. She was afraid that it would be too small since she had just given birth so she ordered a larger size than me, but it ended up being way too large and long, so our mom took it in a bit and hemmed the bottom shorter.
- My dress (right) came about a month and a half after I ordered it. My sister ordered hers a couple of weeks after I did and hers arrived within days suggesting that they don't store these products in one place. When my dress finally arrived, I was surprised at how well it fit! I was nervous that it would be too large like my sister's, but it wasn't. There was a small section of fabric around the waist that stuck out a little and it was very long for my 5'3 short self with 3.5"" heels (totaling 5'6.5 or so). My mom helped me shorten it and sew in the extra fabric that was sticking out, but as she was doing that, she discovered not 1, but 2 pins hiding in the fabric. If I had worn it to my sister's wedding without having it altered, I would've been getting pricked all night!

All in all, shipping was...random. Alterations needed were...random. Sizes were...random. And shape of bust was...random! So, if you feel like gambling, this dress could be right for you!...Maybe!"
Not impressed with this bra at all.  Fitted small and was NOT a comfortable fit. Wish all bras were created equal.
"Good price for all the equipment that comes with it, but the bigger the plugs and tapers get the heavier they are. I ended up not being able to use the bigger sizes because they weighed my ears down too much."
Perfect for kindergarten
"Cute, cute! Just very tight, and the ruffle already ripped the second time my daughter wore them. She's average size. So sorry about this because they're super cute!"
"I think I'm the only reviewer who doesn't find these comfortable, I guess because I was using a super soft modal blend before.  Switching to this after that is like getting used to recycled toilet paper after the ultra-plush stuff (or maybe that's not a good analogy because you only use toilet paper so many times a day as opposed to wearing something).  I've had these for over a year and find I don't pull them out of the drawer very often; I'd rather just do the laundry more often and use the ones I prefer.  I even prefer regular old Hanes to these.

Anyway, these are definitely not sexy but they function and don't cost much.  Eh."
The boot looks great and I love the gray color. BUT the footbed is so uncomfortable it's like walking barefoot on cement. I considered getting inserts but in the end decided to return them because they were a bit snug in the calf over my jeans. Perfect for leggings or very skinny jeans though.
Nice shorts but really tight around the thigh area. I guess you cant have chunky thighs to wear these shorts. I am 5'2 I weigh 140.
"The dress is fun but kind of cheap. The hem on the shirt tipped the first day. I don't expect it to last forever. My 3 year old wears it all the time and loves it, just not sure how long it will last."
I returned these shoes as they did not provide the arch support that I require
"I wear a women's size 11. I don't usually fluctuate between sizes, an 11 fits perfect every time. I ordered these in a 44 and they were very small in both length and width."
"I'm a 28"" waist and the XS was too big.  I was on the tightest hook from the beginning and it wasn't that tight or tight enough to do anything."
I gave the shoes three stars because they actually look good.  My son complained that they squeezed his toes and he refused to wear them after three days.  What a waste of money.
"This is a very well made top; the fabric is heavy, strong and nice to the touch, and I like the flattering cut. The top looks great. My only grievance is that it fits me in a rather relaxed way and is not ""running ready"" at all. It is a pity as I had high hopes for it. Other brands, such as Reebok and Nike, fit me just right when I buy small size. For reference, my bust is about 33 inches and waist is 25 inches, and the top is quite relaxed in the bust area and altogether loose at the waist. I know we can say it is bordering on XS, but, really, I own lots of small sized tops and they fit just fine. Otherwise, a nice garment."
Bought for mother. She didn't think they fit well she has an extremely narrow foot so we're a little loose. If foot wasn't narrow probably would have fit fine.
the pendant looks really nice the chain is super tiny and looks like it will break so i am buying a better chain
"Material is very flimsy, not really a cardigan - more like a cover up."
The costume was great quality but huge on my son who was almost 3. We bought the toddler size and it was more like the fit for a 4-5 year old. We still made it work.
This is not a dress. More like a shirt. Or something you can wear with leggings. When i tried to put it on after buying a large. it was a little snug and i broke the strape trying to put it on. Im just going to take it to the cleaners because it should be an easy fix and the shirt is reall cute. Other than that no complaints.
Nice but they have grippers on the bottom I wish it said that somewhere :( not what I wanted
ok .. A LITTLE TIGHTER AROUND THE WASTE THAN EXPECTED ..
Not for petite women. Smallest size is a 5.
"The shirt was short, not long enough. The shirt also flared out instead of being closer to your body."
Ok but smaller than I realized
I would have rated this higher but after 3 weeks of carrying it - the zipper handle broke of the front pocket.
"Although the product description says ""Welcos 7 Pack"" the item you are receiving is actually only a 4 pack like in the photo provided by them. These bras are comfortable for around the house or running errands but definitely don't use these as a sports bra! The padding does tend to move around slightly; however, given the price you pay it's understandable. My only concern was when the package arrived in my mailbox the outer packaging was fine, but the inner bag the bras were packaged in was ripped open and broken."
"Cute, very inexpensive in price and *cheap* in quality earrings.  I knew exactly what I was getting  (as in, ""You get what you pay for"") when I ordered these, and have no complaints in that regard.  However, I must say that it's the absolute worst sort of false advertising for these to be sold under a marked down from $99(!) discount.  These earrings, in terms of quality, are more along the lines of the sort that you'd allow a child to borrow for Halloween; costume pieces that you'd shrug your shoulders over if they were lost or damaged.

These are currently ""discounted"" at just under seven dollars.  In truth, this is more like what they'd actually retail for, with a proper sale price being anything under three dollars.  I'm seriously considering giving them a matte finish so they don't look quite so exactly like something that you use to be able to get from a box of Cracker Jaxx.

These earrings are adorable for what they are:  Very, very cheap costume jewelry."
"A little lacking in the support area. A let down,I won't be duying this style of brief from Hanes again,was expecting better quality,simply put they sag in important areas."
Can't complain I didn't pay a arm and a leg for these so not bad. They not as comfortable as my Guess shoes I purchased though! Good for the money!
I would never wear it and it was the same exact way on them and they were different heights. This is a dress that would require black leggings to the knees just to pull it off
"I received these today, and love the way they look. They are very cute shoes. However I cannot comfortably get my foot into these. I typically wear a size 8 1/2, I got the 9 and they are very small and uncomfortable. I am going to return and try the size 10. I hope they fit!!!"
Falls off.....I lose it every time I wear it!
"I love crossbody bags since they free up my hands when walking. However, the strap adjustment on this bag is kind of clunky, and while I love the RFID blocking feature, the compartments are not my favorite. I'll be trading this model up when I find a viable replacement."
the bottoms aren't supportive of a big belly
"I originally ordered a 7, those were waaaay too big. I then ordered a 5 and initially thought they fit okay, though a bit too big, but after wearing them a couple of times they are definitely too big both in the waist and thigh area for me. I do have a small butt and skinny legs, but usually I can get 7s & 5s that fit me really well. Also, the color I received is much darker than what is pictured even though I selected the lighter option. I'm bummed that I will likely have to donate these after only wearing a couple of times, but skinny jeans aren't flattering if they're kind of baggy."
"After some of the reviews written on these briefs, I expected great things.  Unfortunately, there isn't enough room for what there needs to be room for."
"I have the 8"" Cellot bows which were huge! Too big, even. Ordered one size down and the bows that came were half the size and just skimpy. I was surprised by the quality."
Cup size is very small so it didn't fit me but the quality was nice and would fit someone with a cup size below C.  Amazon and this seller were efficient in processing the return and refund.
"Fits smaller than the size. I matched all her same size shoes to this shoe, the bottom matches but then you look inside and you can see why it isn't the same size as the other shoes. Point is, order the next size up. The fuzzy also sheds like a pup."
I was expecting a beige color shoe.  They are a weird green.
"This dress runs really small. I wear a 22/24 and ordered a 28 based on the sizing chart and it was a very tight fit. It is also extremely low cut requiring a tank top to be worn under it.

The material and design is nice. Just wish the sizing were more accurate."
"Color is a gold shimmer, which was ok. It is very shear. Need an under shirt"
Itchier than expected
"Beautiful shoe but runs very big!
Ordered a size smaller and still too big!"
These sunglasses don't protect  UVs.
The material is thin. But I mean it's 10 socks for $10. So there's that
"zipper difficult to deal with, a little small"
It wasn't all that I thought that it was....and it broke in half fairly quickly from simply just wearing it.
"For a sleep shirt, it's OK.  The material is a tiny bit rough."
The neck opening was huge and kept falling off my shoulder.  It was pretty large all over.
Still trying to decide my opinion on this bracelet. Looks good in the photo but looks cheap on arrival. The bracelet was large when placed on my wrist and they said the band is adjustable. Can anyone tell me how to adjust it? Still ou get what you pay for.
They were comfortable but unfortunately I'm down to one pair because the other two got destroyed in the washer and dryer I recommend handwashing these
I have bought quite a few of the Jambu shoes and I love them. For some reason these fit a little loose. I needed to pull the strap tighter than usual to keep the shoe from slipping. They are really cute though.
"Construction is shoddy. I've already had a button fall off. The stitching at the pockets is coming loose, I will need to repair soon. The fabric itself is of a rough, lower quality. I would not purchase again."
"I wear size 9 to 9 1/2, I returned the 91/2 pair & exchanged for a 10 1/2, I wish I had ordered the size 11 pair. Merrill has always fit me before, I don't know why they changed their sizing on this shoe."
"The product does eliminate the odor in my shoes.  It does have a nice citrus-like scent.  It does not prevent further funkification of the footwear.

Basically, I take my shoes off, I spray them, they are defunkified.

I wear them once, and they are re-funkified.

I bought this product because of reviews stating that it kept their shoes odor free for days at a time.  Not so for I of nas-TAY foot funkification...  Blech..."
"MAKE SURE YOU BUY A SIZE SMALLER,IT WILL COVER BUT YOU MUST MAKE SURE YOUR SIZE IS'NT TOO BIG. GOOD BRA THOUGH."
"This is a pretty bracelet, but as I mentioned on my other bracelet purchase, it is too big around for my wrist.  You need to provide dimensions on size."
I got 2 sizes bigger than what I usually wear and it was still tight. Cute shirt though.
"The fit was good, but the dress was almost completely see through."
"Thumbs up for being cotton, good cup fit, just too tight around the band by about an inch."
Smaller than expected and the strap is very flimsy...cute for quick errands.
Wasn't what we thought
I like the style and number of pockets with these scrubs. Even the material is nice but the quality leaves something to be desired. I have 3 pairs (all from different stores) of scrub pants in this style and every one came either with stitching already coming loose or the stitching came loose/separated by the second wash. For the price I feel that the quality is poor but the design helps to offset my frustrations some.
"Fabric is nice and soft, I bought this to use under a sheer shirt, and this does work as an underlayer so I will wear it. Fit seems to be fine. I like the racerback style because it stays where it's supposed to as opposed to scoop front and back tanks.

The arms, neck and hem are serged edges which look cheap (but at least they lay flat). Even though it was ""only"" $10-11 delivered, this seems pricey for a very thin fabric undershirt. The ivory fabric was definitely see-through and would not work worn on its own, and would just look like a cheap tank top - which is what it is.

The fabric garment label is of a more robust fabric than the shirt and annoyed me sufficiently to cut it off.

Here is a question for the maker of these tanks. I wonder if the following is reasonable:
I have been looking for a good tank for use as an underlayer for some time. I took a chance on this out of desperation, a blouse I bought was too sheer to wear without that underlayer. I have never been able to figure out why what is basically an undershirt that guys can get in a 3-or 4-pack for almost nothing has to be so much more expensive when it's made for a woman. This garment's construction costs have to be pretty inexpensive - the fabric, cutting, serging, that's about all there is to it... but I paid $10 for it while it weighs maybe 4 oz. and it arrived in a small envelope. It's not as though tank top styles change that much, and when it's essentially a perennial item - a shirt like this should come in multiple packs to be useful. If it was available in multi packs I would love to see a 3- or 4 pack - which I would likely pay say $25 for .... that seems a reasonable price for something that looks so simple to produce."
"These fit me as all Nine West pumps do as far as sizing. I am a 9.5 and Nine West is pretty consistent with sizing and true to size. I did exchange these for the Gramercy because, while these fit in the actual sizing, the width is a little too wide for my foot. This specific style gaps at the arch of my foot which I do not like the look of. The Gramercy does a tiny bit but it is considerably less of a gap and looks better on my foot. I do have narrow feet and a high arch so take that into consideration for yourself.

I am very pale and this nude color looked good against my skin tone for a nude heel. Often times, the nude on shoes is too tan or dark."
Ok purse  and went with the violet but a little too large to use as everyday purse and material feels like jeans so decided to return but different option.
it is very sexy and nice
Somewhat stiff.
Good grief....lol....this hat might fit by the time she's 3. It is very cute....and very warm....so will happily save it. It was a great price and arrived in good time.....that was great.
feels cheap.
Size larger that I require
"Too narrow in the toe area, no padding in the sole.... sent these back"
The purse is perfect however was sent to me with security tags attached :/ Had to find a store that could release this particular tag and that was a bit annoying :) I do love this bag tho!!!!
"These run way big, and the whole point of a biker skinny jean is to be fitted. I washed and dried them in hot hot water. Kinda fixed the problem but not perfect. They weren't that expensive so I also went ahead and modified mine to a more current look."
Okay for the money.  The butterflies on this bracelet make it look cheap.
"The waist may be skinny, but the legs aren't.  They look like the regular style.  A little cheaper looking in person than the picture."
"I'm a 34A and ordered a small, and it was too big in the bust. Otherwise, it's a great top. The sleeves are extra long, which I love."
"I am 5'6"", 145, narrow hips with a bit of a belly.  I usually wear a medium in active pants, sometimes a large.  Ordered these in a large and couldn't get into them.  Cute if you can get a size that fits you."
It looked cuter in the picture but its a nice dress- Have to fix the arm holes and get it taken up a bit but worth it
"Very short, slightly snug around the arms."
"Material is horrible,and reminds me of a superhero spandex.  But it can be an at home outfit. I only bought it because it was $5."
I loved how this ring looked. It was very shiny and looked good from all angles. It however started losing stones/jewels after about two months and after one dislocated others followed quickly afterwards.
Run large. Dont stay up.
This shirt was a little small for an XL however I'm motivated to get to a weight where it will fit better.
"Beautiful Shoe but too big in width and the strap was very loose. I loved the wider heel, it gave the shoe more stability."
"The fit of the dress is great, but I found the ruching on the sleeves to make this dress a little too old in style. The flow is great, and the material feels nice, but I need a more modern look."
"We cannot seem to keep track of socks, so we were looking for a lot of socks at a reasonable price. Fashion socks are so expensive. These are not as high of quality, but they did the job fine, before we lost track of most of them :)

Our son is 20 months old now, and these will definitely not fit him up to three years old. They are small now!"
I would rather it was firmer to hold the purse shape.
"I am a clydesdale and a saucony triumph fan, having worn the brand for 5 plus years, running for 20 plus years. I was sceptical about the new offset that saucony was implementing and can now say that I won't be buying any triumphs after the 8.  The offset  of the 9 seemed to affect my hips and stride. My body just wasn't ready for the change. Triumphs are a great shoe, just not for me."
"Overall, I was surprised with the quality of the hat. it's tightly knit and has a nice warm liner. Living in northern Minnesota, it will be a go-to hat for being active outside (hiking, cross country skiing, shoveling etc.., but probably isn't warm enough for more sedentary outdoor activities (like ice fishing).

As for size, the circumference fits as it should, but it is a little baggy on the top and I have to pull it back frequently.  I will be keeping it as you get what you pay for, but I probably wouldn't buy it again due to the extra room on top."
I'm only 5 foot and for the medium. It's still a bit short and not as loose as I was hoping.
I really expected something better form Lucky Brand it looks a little shear on the sight.
The chain is cheap and alread broke but the pendant is very nice. Its heavy and may be the reason the chain came apart
Cute shoes but i could take the narrow shoes and I ordered an wide
"Every time you wash it, more of the design fades and peels off."
Be careful it runs big than usual .
Nice for the price but very short!
I prefer a zipper.
not much spandex so for a shirt that runs small it won't fit
"it is longer tan the picture, it looks nice, im trying to make it shorter, hope that will  salve it. it looks a lil bit like the pic, but not a lot of complains with the price."
a large is more an 8 to 10. was going to send back for a bigger size but i didn't want to wait again.
"LOVE the color. Heck yea! Love the overall design. Heck yea! Love Dansko- yes yes! Out of the box the leather is soft and the footbed feels great- minus too little arch support.

The toe design on this show narrows in more than usual along the outside toe-line starting from the pinky to around to the big toe. A slim tulip shape instead of the typical Dansko petal. This made my smaller toes rush in the longer I wore these shoes.

I was curious how the fit around the ankle would be. At first it was soft and no issue. After about a half hour/45 minutes, they started to chaff, gave me blisters at the bottom of both inside ankle bones and at the back ankle where the elastic V's.

I wore these on a fair weather day to work which consists of a sit/stand/walk combo. I could only do 3-4 hours before the ankles blisters and rubs hurt to badly.

Possibly going to return them."
These runs a bit large ..10.5 would be excellent !!!!!
not as flattering as it looks~when you use the back loop~ it gives too much lift to the front I don't like clevage when I am on the treadmill!
"I like the retro styling of this suit, but the sizing is WAY off. I wear a size 4-6, ordered a M as others recommended to order up, (usually I wear a S in most clothing) and the torso is very short, and the overall size is too small. I can squeeze into it, but that does not bode well for durability. Disappointed. Now I must return it for a larger size. If you are a S, you must order a L, so order 2 sizes up!"
"The color is much darker than what is pictured. It is closer to a dark brick or almost brown than the red you see. Will be shipping it back for a different purse. It is also pretty big, which I guess is the trend for purses currently."
Not bad pants just didn't get right size. I shouldve sized up
Attractive shoe however lacks comfort....little padding or support.  I wear a 7 med pretty consistently and this shoe fit as expected.
Color was VERY dark and the snake skin looked as though it was printed on.  I returned it.
Bought these pants washed but did not dry them and ended up being high waters. Comfortable pants but not enjoying the length.
Zipper gave out after owning for 6 months so not really impressed with the quality.  I will look for a different brand when purchasing another sweatshirt.
Love the look but the footbed is slippery.
No support at all for large or pendulous tatas.  It's comfy and is more of a lounge bra or sleep bra.  Would be totally useless for any physical activity.  It arrived sooner than expected which is always a bonus.
It's okay but too shiny
I love that idea and concept to this plug. Flange part is a little large. Little stretching and I'll be able to get them in.
thought it would fit loose like the one I bought local but fits too tight and has no style. It is soft so I keep it. I wear for cleaning the house.
nice shirt but small
"nice color , good quality and presentation. But the lock system  is not safe ."
only problem was the largest size offered was a 44 and we needed 48-50.
"these run big, and i even went down a size. I also don't like the leg opening, it says its a straight leg, its not its a flare/bootcut, the opening is really much larger than I like, and I honestly may be sending them back, I am a girl that loved her Lawman and Rockies and have found that the men's Cowboy cut Wranglers actually have the same leg style and have gotten two pairs of those, and they are great 32 x 36 is perfect for me.....so if you like your jeans looser and relaxed out, and a large opening for your ""Fat baby boots"" fine, but not for me!  Quality wise they are good, but no where near the tough denim of the men's.  which for our ranch and farm work actually requires, honestly of I snagged these jeans on stray fencing or barbed wire they would be tore up in an instant"
If you want something to fit perfectly its not always the way you want it but its guaranteed that the time and delivery is right and also looks just like the picture.
Two of the ring's hinges are screwed up making them impossible to use.  Otherwise these are just as expected and pictured.
"I am a woman, but tried a men's shoe to get some width. Skechers are always too narrow in women's sizes for me. I thought this ""wide width"" size might work, but was disappointed and returned them. I love the styling and lightweight, though."
You get what you pay for
"This hoodie is super cute but I was disappointed to find the zipper was cheap plastic at this price.  Not sure how long it will be before I have to replace the zipper, but I suspect not long."
"After research i found that i ended up getting one of the heavier material shirts, and its too big. i wear a medium-sized shirt, needed a small. If you are looking for the lighter materials, go with bahama or tamiami. maybe you won't sweat like i did..."
Fits big for my nice but it's okay for play time.
Quite disappointed - I went up a size from the size charge so they wouldn't squeeze in my thighs and they squeeze the ever loving crap out of my thighs. They also roll really bad.
"It took me some time to find these shoes. I had the previous version, which I loved, and wore all of the time, everyday, not for working out, but for walking. These are somewhat stiffer and significantly less breathable. My feet, which aren't particularly hot, sweat like the dickens in these things - otherwise they are comfortable. I bought them because my previous pair finally wore out, but I wore them through hot temperatures in Turkey and they held up well - these certainly won't work on my current trip to Egypt as they are far too hot!"
Nice looking but rather wide
The shoes I received were long an narrow so didn't fit my foot real well but good enough that I kept them.
"Customers are correct, this is a nice piece of jewelry but due to the curves it is difficult to use as a magnifier although it might be perfect for just reading a price tag. You have to find the right angle to view by though. A neat statement piece so I am happy with my purchase."
"Arrived quickly and as described.  I noticed it fits a little snug around the bust and the sleeves are tight around the ends. I prefer a looser fit especially in fabrics that have little or no stretch in them. I ordered the blue/aqua color and love it. Bright and perfect for spring/summer. Lightweight but not sheer. I don't need to wear a cami or tank under it. I use this shirt for golf, vacation wear, and everyday wear."
Awesome quality but it's a small fit. So if you have large wrists I'd pass on this one.
"They are adorable but far too small. My daughter wears a size 1. Normally size1 is a little big but these boots are very small for a size 1. They look like a toddler size. I wonder if it was sized incorrectly.. I am going to have to return them. If my daughters wants a larger size, I will definitely get them. They are cute."
"Slightly smaller than my other pair of wrangler shorts. I ordered the same size that fits a bit loose in my current shorts and these are VERY tight despite being the ""same size"".

Otherwise they wear nicely, and look good.

returned due to size
not what I expected material wise.. other wise I would of kept them but sending them back.
"Very very wide.i have wide, but they are double wide."
The top looks like a 3/4 but bittoms look more like 18 months. Bottoms are also very thin!! I got this to give as a gift. I'm not sure I will.  Also bows on legs are a brighter pink.
Gave them to my sister
batteries wear out fast in this watch....not usual for a new timex:(
"Great shoe, when wet it becomes slippery."
"I'm sure this was meant for children and not adults, but I bought this for my husband's Halloween costume and the mask is smaller than his face, but it still covers majority of his face and looks great! the foam cushion in the nose keeps falling out so I'll have to glue it on so it'll stay but you get what you pay for and it's good for the price in my opinion."
"Got these on sale from Amazon recently. I really wished they worked for me, but they are snug in the toe area. I'm an 8.5 & don't have wide feet, but these are cut very narrow at the top. They're comfortable otherwise, but I don't see them loosening up enough at the top. Sadly returning :("
Cheap. Lasted a week
"Had to return because it was too large,  also brim is too big to wear in the pool,  but good quality and color."
"So I figured id give it a whirl. I had given up even trying to find a strapless bra but the reviews and comments had me sold. And really, this might have worked. But it cut into the top of my chest, making an odd slightly over boob on top. It was comfy enough, but it didn't look right. In a smaller size, i could see this working beautifully."
"I got the XL, because most products like this have wicked tight elastic that causes unflattering lines. This product had a very large waistband, which is about as far as the pleasant surprises goes. The navy color is nice. All of the material is quite thin, which is good if you want lightweight and not very fluffy. The actual crinoline layers are not very stiff at all. They don't actually feel like crinoline, but I'm not a fabrics expert. They are softer and less scratchy than most petticoats, but at the expense of volume. I don't know why I didn't realize that this product was only 2 layers, I might have reconsidered. Wearing it underneath a skirt that already has a considerable amount of built in flounce and volume to it does give it a nice added ""oomph"" though. (Sorry, I didn't get good pictures of the skirt, but all of these are with the petticoat underneath. Looks about the same without it, really. Just keeps it looking fuller when you walk and move)"
"Small opening, returning for large."
"These are tiny, which is fine. However you must be prepared to constantly check that the earring is closed. This earring would not be suitable for children as the earrings will open and fall out. Try something with more heft."
Fit is too large but I usually am a smaller size.
"Best value hands down.  I own three other cases, some more expensive than this, but for practicality and value, this case can't be beat.  The pillows are way better than those that came with cases that were more than double the price.  The slots are big enough for large faced watches like the Invicta.  I would definitely purchase these again.

Update (May 2015):  I did order another one, but things are not the same.  First got the nice gray one (from Vitacoco) that was boxed.  Ordered another and got a different inferior version (from e-rainbow) that was not even boxed for protection with a beige interior, flimsy dividers that move around, different clasp with no key and lock, no contrasting white stitching on the bottom half of the box and worst of all, cushions that are way too short for the spaces reaching only about two-thirds of the length.  Terrible quality!  I'm afraid that ordering these from Amazon might have become a gamble--not knowing which one you will end up receiving."
To small but not worth sending back due to shipping charges
"If the straps had been adjustable I would have kept the dress. The fit was ok, but I feel like with the straps being in one place that the top sat too high on my chest and back. Material was good and would be a great dress to just throw on. Wish it would have worked.

UPDATE: The company has contacted me twice now to change my review to 4+ stars or delete my review all together. This now makes me wonder about the validity of the reviews posted for this product."
"Cute shirt, but runs extremely big."
"The product itself might be good. But the size is too smal. I took a 7.5, it can fit a couple minutes afterwards they start to hurt.
I'm trying to order a 0.5 size bigger to see...."
"I saw RAVE reviews about this product, so I bought one, even though I didn't want to spend the money.  It is handy - it covers up an unbuttoned fly, or even an unzipped fly if you're desperate!  However, I have wide hips and (used to) have a slim waist, so it was constantly riding up and exposing what it was supposed to hide.  I have to spend all day jerking it back down.  That being said, I did use it while a little pregnant, a lot pregnant, and after the baby.  It's certainly better than a whole new wardrobe or wearing sweat pants every day."
Product looks a little cheap
not really good as i expected.
"Really cute. Super small. Ok for this price, probably only get 1 or 2 uses out of them."
"Hard to say if my daughter will wear these. She wears a 1 1/2 shoe and these seemed very roomy and wide, and did slip off her feet a bit. You can adjust the ties to make them tighter so we may do that (or wear with thick socks). She promised me she'd wear them, so we'll see. Love the bright colors. Great spring casual shoe. If you're getting it to wear barefoot, definitely order a 1/2 size down."
"The material is nice...soft and good coloring. This item is a gift ,but they might be a lttle snug. I measured them against another pair that fits (same size) and there is approximately 1/2 inch different. I guess I can always convert them into a bag if they are way too small."
"Very pretty, would be a nice addition to a wardrobe but order at least 2 sizes bigger.  Runs very small."
The shoe is fine the only thing the color is little different than what I was expected
"The small horn is very lightly stuffed and didn't hold it's shape during shipping -- it bends over now due to a permanent crease.  And the fuzzy ears don't look like equine ears.  Some extra cotton batting and a needle and thread fixed the horn, but this is definitely more suited to a child.  Wouldn't look right for an adult unicorn costume.  Also, the tail is beyond useless.  It looks like a fuzzy sausage.  I gave it to my cat and she's now using it as a toy."
"Very comfortable as you would expect from Clarks but did not last two weeks. The back of the shoe rubbed off.  I have never had this happened before so I was really surprised.  Otherwise, cute and comfortable shoes."
It is pretty and well made. I liked the style because this is what we wore in my teens and 20s. It has a lot of spandex. Even at the tightest hooks and having selected a size too small I have problems with it riding down. For play it is OK. For day wear it is iffy. Unless you get off on pulling your nylons and garter up in public.
Liked the boot but they run narrow. Waited to long to return so I'm giving them to a friend.
Cute setting. The stone is much more clear then pictured. It looks milky.
"UPDATE: Machine washing on normal causes them to stretch and pucker and fuzz. I have to hand wash to keep them from going bad. See photos.

Going backpacking in the humid climates of SE Asia and I opted to see what all the fuss was about for these underwear. Bought several sizes and styles to test them out. I usually wear a medium underwear, and a small thong. All the reviews said order sizes down and X-small was indeed the best fit. I was really curious about the reviews that said you could wear them for days, and I will now adamantly disagree with that after using them.

Pros:
- Cute colors
- Sporty / Sexy fit
- Very breathable mesh
- No double cotton lining
- Could wear them inside out

Cons:
- Machine washing on normal causes them to stretch and cup and fuzz. Poor quality.
- Must order a size down
- Not ""Miracle"" underwear
- Pricey
- Humongous tag. Not really an issue.

Although they're nice, underwear is underwear. If you normally get sweaty in underwear, you'll still get sweaty in these. If you normally have underwear that smell used by the end of the day, these will too. If you never have a problem with smell or sweat in regular cotton underwear, then yes, you could wear these for days."
"I really liked this wallet at first but after using it for just a couple of months the leather portion along the top of the card pockets has become somewhat loose. Also, the material for the card slot lining is a kind fabric that doesn't hold it's shape well resulting in the cards not being very secure. I think the slots could have more of height difference as well, it can be difficult removing a card from a rear slot without having to put your entire finger between the pocket to get a grip on it."
"I like the wide toe box, and this is very cute with a lot of outfits. However, the sole is on the slippery side. Use with caution on laminate, marble, or similar slick floors. The shoes are made in China. The reason I have stuck with Keens and Danskos is that they are comfortable (for being on my feet all day) and have good soles. I was hoping to expand my horizon with these shoes (which come in a variety of very cute styles), but these will be the only pair of Alegria shoes I will own."
"These run very, very wide.  Beware there's a chance you could step out of them.  The foot bed is so comfortable I kept them and I'll wear them with
socks this winter."
"I love the idea of this top, however, it barely holds the girls...so no support, and it doesn't cover the girls up completely, because of the lack of support, you'll find your boobs going down under the bust area."
"Quality enough, but after like one wash it was like the torso would fit a very small person???  Come on, Hanes."
"Made in China, but fit as expected"
"I still love the shirt. Its just that I have larger boobs so even though I'm 5'10 and a size 8 to 9 (US) I had to order XXL. Now I get a lot of Plus size emails, but that's ok too"
"If you have big arms, shirt is not a good fit."
"The sweater was a big hit at the party, it runs a little small, and one of the sleeves started to ravel at the wrist. Concerning the price I thought the quality would have been a little better."
"These little boleros are supposed to fit snuggly, but this is ridiculous. This is a ""whisper"" of a bolero even for a bolero. I bought the X-Large and I still can't wear it. You really do have to have a perfect figure to pull off this little sweater. For girls with fab bodies, I'm sure it looks great."
"i was happy to get this until i see the side ripped.nice design, fits good, liked the material but i wasn't happy about the rip. (first time wearing it!)"
"The color is not a dark navy blue, and the scarf doesn't seem as long as the one pictured.  I won't return it, though, because it will still work."
was a nice looking shoe
"I love the Bali front closure sport style bra so much I bought this. The fit is a little uncomfortable, like most underwire bras. It runs big around and a little in the cup. All in all it's as good as any back hook bra."
All are same length need slightly longer for top section
Not really great quality.
Beautiful shoe but they are a full size too small!
Very cute but roll like crazy. Need garter belt
Calf fits but the footing is one size to big. Im hoping with some shoe inserts or foot padding sock insert they will fit better other wise not sure I like them.
"I bought these for a one time event and they fit well.  The color in the photo is accurate.  I was disappointed that they seemed to unravel slightly at the seam, but I guess you get what you pay for."
Had to send it back.to small.
"I was looking for a new waist pack with an easily accessible pocket large enough for my new Galaxy Note phone. This meets that requirement.

Pro: Very nice appearance. Appears to be good quality leather and lining fabric. Front pocket that open on three sides with a zipper; has identification & payment card slots and a loop to attach something (such as a key chain.) The pocket is accessible when wearing the belt and is easily large enough for the phone even with its aftermarket case. The larger pocket easily holds my wallet and blood glucose test kit. The small wedge pocket contains my cache of glucose tablets nicely, and the slip pocket on the front holds my assorted keys. Very attractive price.

Con: The strap does NOT adjust to 52 inches as described. At the full extended length it is a snug fit around my 48 inch waist (as measured by my doctor the week before I ordered it.) Also, the woven belt rolls over while in use - not very good looking and sometimes uncomfortable.

No Opinion: I have not used the ""water bottle holder"" that takes up the second wedge pocket. I have no need for it because whenever I am walking a distance where I would need a water bottle I am using a CamelBack instead.

Summary: Well worth considering if you are looking for this type of product. But don't believe the length of the belt."
Very cute shoes but they were just too big and kept slipping off my daughter's heels. Had to send back.
"These for nicely and are fine for work. I was expecting them to be more comfortable inside. I don't walk much in them and I still feel like I need to go get gel inserts. If you can live with inserts, then these are good enough."
"Really liked this suit.  I ordered the XXL.  I'm 38in around the hips.  The bottom fit perfectly.  The top, however is not proportioned to the bottom.  It was a size or two smaller.  There is no support in the bra, so there was no way to work the top to fit.  I returned the suit."
Not sure what I did wrong ordering this. But when I returned it I had to pay $13 for shipping.  Very pretty bra just too small for me.
Its a great shoe. It goes with any color I want to wear and they're very stylish. Also the heel isn't too high
"The shoe is Cute and fairly comfortable. They run a tad short. I am breaking them in or they are breaking my feet in...not sure which yet. Won't be walking any long distances in these, but will be fine for going out.  Love the yellow!"
"Its small for a 3X, more like a 2.5X if you push it a bit lol. Im keeping it though, Ill fit into it shortly"
"Quality no as nice as I had hoped, but not expensive either."
Cute shirt but gigantic.  I'm trying to figure out how to take it in.  The material is super soft. But the shirt is huge.  Order small
"Material, although very soft, is VERY thin.  Definitely will have to wear a t-shirt under this t-shirt.  Ok for the price, but not a total bargain."
The stonesecond are lose and fall offf
"Nice shirt but way off on size. Fit more like a xxsmall but the sleeves were proper length if not slightly longer, body is way way way too small.."
"I'm 5'1"", 115 lbs, and usually wear an S in spanx, although I found this one to be bigger than my other pairs. I ended up returning it bc it simply wasn't tight enough. (I wear a size 2 in other pants/jeans)"
"My husband is very thin but these just didn't fit right, in particular, the waist was uncomfortably tight. They are being returned."
I would return it but had already washed.
"Even though I ordered the small and I'm normally a medium, the pants are a bit too large. Otherwise, they're fine - soft and comfortable."
Too big....baggy and long.... But very cute and quality made.
I had to return it. They are to wide.
"I opened the amazon box excited to try my new leggings but was overcome with the most foul odor. I have never purchased an article of clothing with such a sickening smell. I figured I would try them on anyway. The smell actually stayed in the room for a few hours after. I have washed them once and they still stink. The fit is nice though. I wear size 14 pants with a post partum momma body and the size large just fit. I'm 5'4"" and the length is a tad long but not obnoxiously long. I don't care much for the shiney spandex like outter fabric but the inside fleece is cozy soft. These are good pants for layering under ski pants, around the house or gym work outs, but I wouldn't wear out with an outfit. I'm still trying to decide if I should return. The smell is awful."
Ordered woman's and got mens. Sizes were confusing  retuned
"These felt like they would be really comfortable.  Based on other comments and reviews I ordered big, but apparently I ordered too big.  But I am returning and getting a size down and hopefully that will be perfect with room to grown (just not too much room)!"
i like the device very much it works very well i use it everyday at home i just love it
"My wife has to be careful when wearing this wrap dress as it unwraps when wind blows or when she is sitting down.
As the material is polyester, it is of a smooth material so it unwraps quite easily.
Other than that, it is rather comfortable.
She doesn't like the design as much and hopes that it could be of a trendier pattern.
The idea of a wrap dress is welcomed as she will be able to breastfeed in it more easily."
"Didn't fit as expected, probably a good bra just not right for me."
"Decent material, although I ordered an x-large after reading they ran small and short. I am 5'5"" and 140lb. This Jacket was long enough although very baggy and not a very flattering fit. I may return it for the $20 or give it so someone."
"I never know with clothes from over seas, so I got xl, and that was too big. This is a cute blouse and can go with many things, I am a size 14 16 and it was pretty large on me."
They fit when first put on but after walking around with shoes they start to slide down making them uncomfortable. Disappointed
"its ok, im 5'2 and the dress is extremely long on me. Tick fabric"
it's ok for the price paid
I don't like the way it looks on me.
"Material isn't the highest quality, looks quite a bit junior. Love the pattern though. May were with a sheath dress for casual and night events."
"Runs a little small. I love Carter's sleepwear in general but the shirt is rather tight and the pants seems smallish in the bottom. My daughter wears disposable so no fluffy cloth diapers to caught fitting issues and I usually don't have a problem, so constantly needing to yank these pants up was a surprise. If you're a cloth diaperer, I'd say skip these for sure. But they are adorable."
"I wish these came in a smaller size. I wear 5.5 shoes and the shoe trees are on the large size. I would not ""jam"" them into any shoes I truly love."
"shows signs of wear after only a few wears... I don't imagine this belt lasting long.  Why can't they make this style out of real, 100% genuine leather?"
"Super soft, super stretchy. Not for support, really. Good for coverage, if you want minimal support."
"Bought this in a large and it was huge. Returned it and purchased a smaller size. Unfortunately I didn't reorder the same brand and the Med was too small. I like the concept, comfy and can wear leggings or tights with it. If I can get the size right I might just like it on me."
"I bought a kids size 3 and they are way to small, I like them but now I am stuck with boots I cant enjoy!!!
I am not going to pay shipping my self to send them back and get a bigger size that is way to much. :( SUCKS"
They fall down a lot. Not what I had expected
The quality could have been a bit better for the cost.
"Great sandal.
I like the look and they are very comfortable
My gripe is that the elastic has lost its stretch after only 5or6weeks

I have had other chacos for years and they are still great."
"Good for costume, but tend to fit on the small side"
"The shirt runs very small, so I am glad I ordered a large. (I'm 32DDD, 135lbs, 5ft 4"") It is very flattering and lovely material but I am rating it 3 stars because I received a wrinkled up shirt in a torn up bag...looks like the shirt had been worn and then returned!!??? GROSS! but I tried it on anyway and it is lovely, but I want to return for a clean new one. THEN I WILL GIVE IT 5 STARS I'M SURE! :)"
"The material was thick enough to cover the ""headlights"" and it was very pretty. I returned the bra because it was too small. I was very disappointed it wasn't available in the next size up."
"These socks are okay, but they are nowhere near as good as the old Marathon socks that Wigwam used to make.  Also, these socks run small.  I wear a women's size 11, so I ordered a size Large.  They barely fit."
I could not get my feet into these because I have a high instep so I sent them back for a full refund.
"Was ok, cotton could be better"
"This is an okay bag, original tag price is $95. No way would I ever pay that!  It looks like cheap material once it arrives, the straps and interior is nice but the base material looks like cheap nylon. I was excited to buy this but disappointed when it arrived."
"It's just ""okay"".  I think the neck opening is too large as well as the length of the arms but it's a good item for a good price."
They only problem I have is that the credit cards are in there so tight it's hard to get them out
I wished they looked as good in the person as they do on the website. Cheaply made could have been better quality.
"A little snug all the way around.  I'm a true medium, size 8-10, and don't usually have any issues, but this was small.  Not un-wearable.  I had to pull on the let holes and break some of the seams to get it to feel more comfortable.  Seemed homemade.  BUT it did last all season and was a fun talking point.  Lots of compliments."
Beautiful boot but had to give them away because they were way too small like two sizes too small
"Comfortable with stretchy, thick fabric, but not as flattering as I had expected. A little too tight for my liking."
"I wish I'd read the GUIDE on fitting, INSTEAD of most of the reviews stating is was too small! I'm usually size small, 34-28-24 and due to the reviews claiming the corsets ran SO SMALL, I ordered 2 sizes up, a large. The darn thing was huge! I suggest you go with the sizing guides, cause for me the reviews on here failed. As for the other aspects of the corset, if was nice enough, I didn't like the bows, it made it looks cheap. The tule was a nice addition. The dark blue was a lighter blue and also didn't care for that.  I returned it for a smaller size in black"
I normally wear a smaller cup size but ordered up. Too small in cup area - bra is okay for causal wear but not for formal wear.
These are  ok. I really expected more support for a pair of shoes of this price. They seem to be nicely made though.
Nice wallet. It does ripped easily and fades quickly too.
Cozy and soft but really only good for the first 1-2 months. Once baby gets a bit bigger and more wiggly they fall off.
"Cute and well made, but is so freaking small. Like I'm 150lbs, size 10 and I couldn't zip the side closure."
The ear pieces stated to have mill due kind of rust to them.
Not same shape. Still pretty cute. Cheaply made but that's not a surprise.
Besides it being the wrong colored that was ordered and it being HUGE I think (hope) this will keep me warm for my walk to work.
"Disappointed in the purse, especially for Kate Spade.  Shoulder strap is held by snaps inside the purse.  The holes were stretched out and the strap would not stay on purse.  Had to return for refund."
FIT MADE FOR KIDS ONLY
Loomed great. About 2 hours into the night the arm bands and waist band started to fall apart.
Needs cushion insole.
"These are very tiny, but pretty."
"The bullet is fantastic, just wish it came with a different chain"
"Comfortable, but tighter than I expected for an XL. The straps show at the neckline under a crew neck T-shirt."
"A friend once told me that there were two kinds of shoes: ""lookin' good shoes"" and walkin' around shoes."" These are definitely ""lookin' good shoes. However, there not so great when it comes to wearing them all day and expected your feet to be comfortable."
"For L/XL, they run small..."
received long sleeve by mistake
"My little girl really likes it, but the ballerina broke mid-torso & has required super glue. She's held intact, so I'm hoping she'll last. Cute jewelry box."
too small can not wear it. will not fit around me
Lighter weight material than I expected.
Didn't look nice on me. To squared.
"I dislike because the bottom, want zipper."
The stones are smaller than the picture shows but they are still pretty.
should have bought XL... I think this size was for asian
They are not see through at the top like in the photo they are completely dark top to bottom with the print and it's not even the same pattern. They were also bigger than others I have purchased I the same size from this brand.
"I bought this watch and also Casio's MQ247B analog watch. Both have stickers on manual booklets saying they have mercury (element Hg, does not say how much) in them! This may be just fine for many people but I try to avoid encouraging use of heavy metals in watch design. Specific to this AQ47-7E dual watch, the screen is made of soft material (acrylic?) and is raised so it will get scratched very easily. The construction of the watch is ergonomic, clean and light. The rectangular watch body is a bit narrower on the sides than the round-faced kinds, making its sides streamlined and not get in the way of wrist bending."
He put it on immediately.
Great for review  mirror and not distracting.
"Loved these Sperrys but they were too small. The size chart was marked 12 S, but that did not show up when I ordered them. :/
Had to completely return for a different pair."
"You get what you pay for.  These are OK,  but not the best quality,  tho I am enjoying wearing them in this hot summer weather.
Not sorry I bought them."
This would have been perfect IF I received the correct colored bras.... Instead I received a duplicate of another bra and not the navy one I requested.
"I love the design concept for this ring - its petite and lovely.  Exactly what I want.  But the execution is poor.  Ive ordered two replacement rings now and all three rings Ive received have had missing or miscast settings in the milgraine.
Eventually the stones with miscast settings would come loose and/or fall out.
I really wanted this ring but I may have to give up on it."
This was purchased for a friend and we got one size larger based on the bust size from reading previous reviews. She wears is a 38C-D. I loved this style on her but having the dress alone on a larger woman I think the short cardigan makes the outfit. I also like the wide blue belt to break up the floral print.  The material is a thick material and was made well. There were no strings showing or any badly seen areas.
"These are super cute but run small for us pear-shaped girls.  Normally, a ladies XL would be comfortably baggy on me.  These are snug.  If they weren't a replacement order for another ill-fitting Amazon purchase, I would return them."
I purchased a Medium based on reviews and it was a bit big on me.
"From reading the reviews the skirt was what I expected it to be. It fit well, I wore it high on my waist and it came to the top of my knees. My only complaint (and why I gave it a 3 star instead of 5) is I ordered a Navy Blue and received Black. Amazon's fault."
These were long to be labelled as 30's. Had to get them altered.
"Gave it to a friend. Cut too small for my feet,but I will be ordering another one soon."
"I loved this coat when I saw it online and it looks the same in real too. Good quality and lovely color and design and pretty warm too. BUT it's not the same size as mentioned, it runs large. Had to return it as they didn't have anything smaller than Small size :("
no comentary
"It was actually really cute and decent quality. But, the S/M fits more like a M/L. :("
love the spanx products but these for whatever reason the top rolls over and bunches up
"Got them today. Beautiful, comfortable, but unfortunately NOT real patent leather as stated in description. Everywhere, on the box and on the shoe itself says ""all man made materials"". Sadly had to return them."
Fabric was not at all what I expected- very thin and almost papery.  I bought brown and think that I would have preferred it in a different color. For the price I think it's not bad.
Great fit but had to take to shoe shop and have all the grommets replaced after 6 wks they are plastic and stared falling out
Were a little tight. But got compliments all day.
"The raincoat fits, and is cute.
The umbrella failed after first use, with one of the umbrella vanes detaching when first deployed for rainy weather use.
Very cheaply made.
Luckily I am craft oriented and repaired it better than when it was first manufactured.
The thread used is below substandard.
I recommend the rain coat, but do not recommend the umbrella."
"This was a beautiful watch, but unfortunately the watch was too small for my wrist. I had taken the tag off when I received it to aid in trying to put it on, but to no avail. The seller was very hesitant in refunding my money (minus a ""restocking fee"") because the watch appeared to be ""worn."" I'm assuming they said that because of the tag being taken off. After a heated discussion with the seller over the phone, they agreed to refund my money. Great watch, just be wary of the seller."
"I would consider these a bit more closely related to tights then traditional socks. The first pair I tried on, one sock is too tight while the other is so loose it sags. Upon washing said pair in the washing machine for the first time they came out looking a sad mess. Several strings and elastic bits have pulled through.
They are ok, as in I'm happy I got them on sale. If want them to last, either hand wash or put in with your dedicates."
"I have bought New Balance 608, blue trim, in size 7 wide for many years.  They have always fit perfectly.  This time I bought the Pink in 7 wide, and they run small.  I measured them against current pair and they are shorter from front to back almost an inch.  They are a little snug, but didn't want the hassle of exchange, so I'm keeping them, hoping they will stretch a little."
"These shoes are good for standing on concrete but not for walking.  I will not be able to wear them to work as planned.  They are very cushioned and soft on the bottom of your foot.  However the top of the shoe is not flexible and if you have a high instep, you will have blisters on the top of your foot.  I was not planning to wear socks with them, but would have to in order to wear them at all.  Not worth sending back, Just keep them for shoes to step into to walk to a neighbor's house."
It was okay.  I bought it for a friend and it kept slipping off her head.
"Runs small...ordered for both of my daughters and fit well up to size 7 juniors...so 1 is going back!
It is cute. Nothing great needs a belt to cover the waist band that is small and a bit odd, but it will be cute worn with a jacket or sweater and just a cute tee to dress it down."
"It's a super cute bag, and initially I thought it would hold up. However, the zipper isn't that great. Eventually it broke (granted, it happened when I was trying to cram is shut). I was able to get it back on the track and sew off the end, so it didn't come off again. However, the teeth of the zipper don't always want to stick together. I probably won't be using it if I need to almost fill it, especially if it's with heavier items because the shoulder straps aren't that comfy. For the price, it's an okay bag."
This boots seems well made but more on the side of a well made leather like and not real leather.  It does not have the feel of real leather which might explain the low price.
"Way big! The reviews all say this runs really big or really small so I ordered my size. I'm swimming in one leg! They are cute, but I'm not some club kid..... I want a pair of cargos that showcase my Assets not hide my body in fabric and trip over my feet. I may reorder smaller if I don't find something else with better sizing guides."
"A nice sholder bag. It was just smaller than I expected which is probably my fault. It does have lots of pockets to put things, but not much room otherwise."
"Purchased to replace a previous ring that was to loose- The finish looked great right out of the box, but I'm pretty active and the finish is wearing thin after a couple months. Still looks good when cleaned and looks expensive but isn't.  For the money, a good deal... but if you work on hobbies and are active don't expect the finish to last forever. It was intended to be a 'disposable' inexpensive fill-in and it serves that purpose perfectly."
shrinks when washed and I hung it up to dry.
"bought a size up and still a little tight. Don't think the picture accurately portrays the inseam length. They are shorter than the picture would lead you to believe, but they are the style that is popular nowadays."
"They were really cute, but fit too tight and I did not keep them."
"meh, could have been better"
"I found this dress to fit very well other than being too long. I am 5 ft 3. There is no way i could wear it without shortening the length.
White color is semi-see through but nothing that some nude shapewear can't fix."
Nice but you need to be short to use then handle and wheels.
Cute but they don' fit. I will end up giving them as a gift.the. Peacock size 7 Grazie fit fine.
"This is a quality sock, and I like the Carhartt brand.  The toes and heels are reinforced ( thicker)  the instep has lycra so it hugs the arch of the foot, so the sock doesn't slide down.  I took 2 stars off because I think the body of the sock is small for a mens sock.  The absolute maximum the top of the sock can be stretched is 12"".  These barely fit my husbands calf, and he wears it with work boots and scrunches the sock down, which is fine.  I hope they don't shrink!  My husband is on the slender side, certainly not stocky or anything - so just be aware of that when you purchase.  Measure the bottom part of your calf."
"They had a chemical smell when we received them and it didn't go away after couple of washes. They were quite tight all over but thick and soft inside. I recommend going a size up, maybe. I probably would go with some other brand next time though."
"The earrings are very pretty.  I agree with other reviews, stating that the crystal is a little large/heavy.  You need to put  a backing on, in order to keep the earring from slipping out.  Other than that, the quality seems very good."
"I expected them to be tighter.  While I'm sure they helped more then if I didn't wear anything at tall, I would like them  tighter."
"Definitely cute, but decently see thorough"
"This bikini was adorable when it arrived, but it was far too small. I am usually a medium/large in U.S. Clothing and I got the largest size available which was still too small. They got 3 stars though for being helpful- it would have been too expensive to ship back so they refunded me the difference."
I bought them as a gift but they came in an old/dirty looking box. Didn't have time to re-box them. The cuffs themselves were ok. I would re-purchase them if I need to but plan to re-box.
"I like some things about these shoes, particularly the fact that they are quite comfortable.  The downsides are that they don't breath well for extended periods of wear, while the knots at the end of the laces look a little ""funny"" perhaps.  Overall, I'm satisfied, but not in love with them."
they were too expensive so I returned them.
"My husband LOVED these shoes - but less than 8 months later they started to ""squeak"" because the cloth wore off of the inside heal.  Too bad!"
Haven't noticed anything except it makes me sweat more.
"Great looking, but they barely fit over my heels."
"I wear watches daily with most of them being low end watches <$200. I was just looking for something to hold my watches when I'm not wearing them, so I purchase this watch case. While I do agree with the other review about the locking mechanism not working and pillows being cheap, I did not expect much from case at this price range. If the lock did work, is it really going to prevent someone from stealing my watches? Also, the piece of the pillows that come off are the sides, which don't really touch the watch nor visible when in the case. The case itself looks more expensive than it is and it matches the rest of my bedroom decor."
Update: these are really cute and fit as expected. I lowered rating from 4 to 3 stars because they make my feet sweat and there is no arch support. These are so cute for a casual shoe if you don't like running around in tennis shoes. Appear to be well made. The only issue I have is there is no arch support. This is common problem for me so it may just be my feet. I am ordering arch supports for them and I will update.
Ok not the quality that I was expecting
"These are pretty cute - but we haven't worn them much yet b/c they are too big.  It would be great if they had a slightly stretchy back so you could use them not just during one size, kids grow so fast."
Little small in the arms
"The shoe seems nicely made; the problem for me was that it was narrow, so I couldn't wear it and can't report on how comfortable it is."
"I bought these hoping they would be thigh highs on me that I could hold up with a garter belt. Alas, they barely come over the knee on me. They add some warmth, I'll wear them under boots I guess. From reference, I'm 5'11""."
To to big my baby can't fit them at all I think they w as to much money plus had to pay shipment o don't feel that was right if you paying $20 it should be free shipping I guess he will have these for years to come
I like the color but it is about a size smaller than an XL. Too bad because it's a really cute top. Also it's really clingy.
i am 5 ft tall. and this dress is a little too short for me to wear in public. I would suggest going the next size up. Don't get me wrong it is a cute dress and it is very comfortable. But after washing it shrinks and its will show my butt if I bend over just a little. So i just use it as lounging attire.
"Not the highest quality, but I didn't want to spend $5 each for a hankie either. They were frayed out of the package and still scratchy after the first wash, but they do the job if you double them up, which you'll want to do. Oh, they are not square like traditional bandanas, if that's important to you."
"I order a large as usually I do, but it was quite big, good cotton"
I sent it back.  There was a rhinestone missing. Unacceptable. It was a very nice bag and I would have kept it if it was not damaged.
"I bought this shirt in the ""Tippit"" color, which looked like a nice soft green. When it arrived it is more like a NEON Green! I bought this shirt in the green color specifically for an upcoming safari....the wildlife will run away if I wore this in the bush!

Still like the shirt, but definitely won't do for a safari. Even homo sapiens made comments like ""Wow! That's a Loud Shirt!"" At least they didn't run away....."
"LOVE the way this dress looks, but it is SUPER short. I gave it to a shorter (and smaller) friend."
Too tight in the arms.  Really nice everywhere else and is a nice quality top. I rarely have a problem with my arms being tight which is why I am even commenting.
Really cute but had to return them  :(
I sent it back because it was a lot smaller that it appears to be. I like bling!
"3 stars because while the set looks good and feels good on the finger, the rock in the engagement ring is not set properly and actually audibly rattles in the setting."
"These are interesting, quite large and heavy for pierced. For the price, seriously, they are fine."
They look pretty but feel cheap
Way too big. However they are soft but fit way over my belly button.
it's nice but didn't fit
Love wearing this robe...concerned if it will 'hold up' for laundering even on gentle cycle with woolite.
"I have bunions, so I couldn't be fair."
"Edited to remove stars! I ordered a blue denim pair that fit great and could not believe how my butt looked in these! I came back to buy the black pair but they are SERIOUSLY LOW RISE! Not in a fun way, but in a slip-off-your-butt-with any-movement way. I ordered a small or 3 and am 5'10 and 130 lbs. The fit was perfect in blue but too small in black and both pairs are too short-  I cuffed the blue pair in summer and in the fall and winter I wear with knee boots. Another caveat; as you gain weight, whatever makes these lift your butt actually crushes it and it looks super odd, so buy your true size and don't try to squeeze into tighter jeans. And note that all pairs fit differently! I received two totally different styles of jeans. I returned the black pair and had to trash the blue after six months since I have been trying to gain weight and my butt ""outgrew"" them."
I normally love all Miss Elaine nightgowns.  This one fit okay but was way too sheer for my comfort.
"3x/4x is perfect, unless you have an ass. i don't even have as big of a butt as other gals my size and these hung so low that you could practically see my crack. def better off buying layne Bryant leggings."
This bracelet has a very difficult catch.  It is a nice inexpensive gift for girls.
"I am 34B and ordered a medium and feel a little constricted in these. I wanted to replace it but for the price of shipping, I decided to just give it away."
"Cute style, but it seems to run at least a half size too large and too wide."
"Usually love this brand but was somewhat disappointed with this particular sandal.  Not one of my favorites, but I kept them anyway. :0)"
color not accurate
"They run a little big around the top but they look great and mu son loves them, in fact he found the exact same pair for $170 and we bought these for a steal."
"havent worn it anywhere yet, i tried it on and when taking it off, one of the clasps dislodged."
"Seems like a quality material. Definitely warmer than I thought.
Thanks"
"My younger son said it is a bit narrow and not easy to put on so I have to returned this. But, my other son likes it a lot. The colors and style is sharp and cool. Almost not like sandlas and I do like the clost toes design to protect their feet and from kicking in staffs.  It is not a lot of support so I don't think it is mean for wearing it for long hours. But, my son did wear it sometime at Hawaii during a few days trip other than his regular tennis shoes."
"Did not care for the quality of these, so I returned them and bought the Ziplock brand pack at Costco."
love these shoes but they run a whole size small. my daugher went up a whole size in this style verses other shoes. we have several colors of these and love them can be worn with dresses or shorts
Good product but the fit was too small. Runs small
It was okay was just a bit too big
"Good warm boots for winter weather.  However, they don't dry out fast when you get them wet.  My 11 year old daughter got some snow in the boot and it took 24+ hours to dry to a point she could wear them again.  Would be nice if they were made a bit taller on the leg to prevent snow from coming in over the top, especially given their higher price point."
Wasn't a bad dress for the price. But a little large especially someone without a large bust. Could be nice but just didn't work for me
"I do use this belt for shorts now, in the summer, because it is not convenient to wear suspenders as I do in the winter under sweatshirts. However, this belt does not stretch as much as I had hoped and tends to cut into my waist if I wear it all day."
Quality worse than expected. Did not return because was leaving on a trip the day after it arrived
I love the bag but it's very heavy.
"The material isn't my favorite. It is shiny, thick and not breathable. It is just not what I was looking for."
"Decent shorts, I guess, but very high rise.  If you're very tall, or if you are an old guy who likes to wear his shorts pulled up to almost to his chest, you'll probably love these.  But if you wear them normally,  with the elastic actually at your waist, they will hang down a long way (i.e. I'm 6' tall, and if I wear them normally, they hang to the bottom of my knees).  That's OK, I guess, but I will probably look elsewhere for my next pair of shorts.
=================
Revised to 3 stars after washing a few times:  Once I washed these a few times, they shrunk a bit, and now the length is more acceptable.  I'm still not thrilled with the high waist, but as long as you don't mind the crotch being a few inches lower than normal, you can wear the elastic around your actual waist and the length is now OK for me."
"bought for a flower girl dress and it nice, but the fit is a little bigger than I thought it would be."
see threw
"I would have given this 5 stars, but my problem is that I ordered an XXL, and I typically wear a size XL.  I specifically read reviews saying it fit as expected at least 74% of the time.  I ordered a size up just in case, and it is very snug.  I am keeping it to give as a present, since it really is very cute, but I am very disappointed that I couldn't wear it, I was very excited about the purchase, until it didn't fit. :("
Somewhat small. Can't move much!
Wouldn't buy them again or recommend them but the product was fine
"too large, I have narrow feet"
"The ankle and leg part was tight and there is no way I could get my pants into the boot, there was just no room to tuck in jeans.  The foot part of the boot seems true to size and  comfortable, although I can only wear them for about 15 minutes without feeling like the circulation to my foot was being affected due to the tight compressing on my ankle. The look of the boot is very nice. The boots were packaged with care in the buckle and snaps were protected. The top of the boot did  seem to have some sort of light padding which was a pleasant surprise. If you notice I use past tense ...  I really like the boots and I really wish it fit but I did have to return them because I just could not wear them for any length of time the tops and were just too tight."
"Good for cool days. Fits great. The zipper, which is good quality, can be a bit stubborn when I try and zip up the jacket. Overall, I am happy I bought this."
"While the fit was Ok, the material is not.  It is stretchy, as described, but it's almost shiny.  Not what was expected.  Navy blue color was spot on, but it's still going back"
nice but very fragile!
"Meh. The bottle touts this as a high shine glaze you use instead of conditioner once a week. I used it yesterday and I definitely wish that I had used a conditioner instead.

The scent is really strong and has chemical undertones, it does fade, but I don't care for it. My hair has a bit shine in the sun, but nothing extraordinary. I have thick, long hair and it feels puffier than normal and I can tell it's more difficult to brush - unlike when I use regular conditioner. It might be ok if you have shorter or layered hair. At this price point, this just isn't a product that I would ever purchase."
was hoping it would looser
"It's way smaller than it looks.  I had intended this as a way to carry my 11.6"" notebook, and that will just barely fit, but there's really no room for anything else.  These days, I use it if I',m just carrying my Kindle and a couple of other small things.  For that, it's fine."
it is much stiffer than other ecco shoes i have these are made in china and not the same grade of material
"Pretty cheaply made. Stones fell out of the crown after my daughter wore it a few times. Granted she is pretty hard on things, but still. Anyway, she still love this set and the wand and gloves have held up nicely."
Nice but is better for petite woman not for medium or tall.
I normally wear an 8-10 standard size and bought an 11 and they were snug. I'd suggest going a size or two up.
"Great Keds style as usual, although a little long in my normal size. Comfy and cute."
not very good quality on the neck. it looks so much better on the picture
I ordered it in white (more like an off-white) color. I liked the style and the fit but this color is too sheer. I won't be able to wear it to work.
"I bought them knowing exactly how they worked. And I thought I would like them better. If you don't want anything more than your name showing on your tag, then this is certainly for you. In the end I just don't like how you have to take the whole band off to rotate it to view the entire details. Having them in hand and thinking about it, just not what I want for me. I will keep them though, and just use them on some other stuff.

The tags themselves seem sturdy and the band is a thick rubber that snaps into holes on the band. It feels tough, but at the same time I worry the little plastic that goes in the holes will break eventually. I would put the final word on these to be that I don't really recommend them, but I don't want to say stay away entirely. They are just ok."
"I have given this a low rating based on sizing. Ordering a 3X (22/24) as to have plenty of room a 3x is more to the sizing of a 14/16.
The shirt quality is excellent, the design is perfect with excellent stitching and length.  I purchased this as a Today's Deal."
"I like the looks of the shoe, but they run very tight not true to size. Have always worn a size 7 but these are too tight."
The strap around the back of the heel does not stay on. I have to use laces to keep them up.
"This is much bigger than expected and is not very feminine at all, even with all of the feminine detail.  I would not buy this product again!"
These were returned. The color was off and were somewhat narrow even for me who has small feet.
"I am a big saucony fan, but these aren't my favorite. The insoles on these are harder than most of the other pairs I have. I like the colors on this style, but not my favorite. I like the old style better."
"Style is really cute; color is good. I am normally a size 6-1/2 M. Sometimes if a shoe runs small, I'll take a 7. I ordered a 6-1/2. The width was okay. but I wouldn't want it any wider. Problem is with the length of the foot bed. It seemed more like a size 6. Funny thing, though, my left heel (only) keeps slipping out when I walk. Unfortunately, it has to go back."
"It has a weird fit, it's a beautiful shoe but if you have a bit of a fat feet like me, and don't get me wrong I can fit in to any regular width, stay away from these, they are kinda poorly design... you'll see! I own a lot of Steve maddens and this are the first pair that don't fit the right way!"
Style was not as flattering on as expected and I should have ordered larger size
"Decent value for the money, although I have better quality.  These are a bit short on the crotch to waist length.  As a result, bending over or crouching produces a bit of over exposure from the rear."
"I wish this suit would have worked out for me. I am 123lbs 5'2"" and a 32Ddd chest and I ordered a medium. I really liked the way it fit my bottom. The suit was a little loose around my stomach and there is absolutely no chest support which I need after having 3 kids. If your chest is perkier then mine it may workout for you. I ended up having to return it."
"Works as a scarf, but does not feel like real cashmere...and color is not really rich-looking."
"This is the second pair of NB shoes that I have had a problem with not fitting.  For years I have worn a men's 9.5EEEE and have always been very comfortable buying online in this size.  This shoe I bought in a 10.50 and a EEEE.  It is long enough, but in no way can this be a EEEE, it is far to narrow to be a 4E.  I don't know what is going on with NB, but make sure you buy NB shoes with the ability to return them if they don't fit.  Better pay shipping back then have a shoe that fits no one."
"So tight, I'm always a medium but this made me feel like a stuffed sausage"
"These fit as expected, but aren't as cute on as I had hoped. They look trashy, like stripper heels."
Fabric sleazy
Cute look but to big
This top was larger than expected even though I ordered my normal medium.  I am going to a small then it should be perfect.  Otherwise a cute top.
"The fabric is just OK. I'm as disappointed with the fit of this shirt as I am with almost everything I buy these days. It seems that ladies clothing is being made for giraffes with very, very long arms. I'm a typical shape for someone of my age (over 65). I'm not especially tall: my hands don't reach my knees with my arms by my sides and I don't like shirts that reach my lower thigh. So I'll wear this one around the house. Maybe I'll try to shrink it. Maybe I have to stop buying clothes on the Internet."
It is not too transparent
"The pointelle design make it nice to wear to sleep or as a layering piece. Loose fit and unstructured light weave fabic not really suitable to wear alone, at least not in the off white color. Icebreaker has a good line of structured merino wool camis that I prefer."
Price ok for three
My mom and I each bought one of these for a trip. The zipper on hers broke right away. For the price it should be made better. I don't see this lasting very long. It doesn't fit very much in it either.
"This is a little snug.  I'm losing weight, so I'm going to hang onto it, I'm sure it will fit great soon!"
"They're attractive in pictures & from a distance but upon close examination you can see sloppy molding on the heel and cheap workmanship in their construction.

I ordered the narrow width but they fit more like a medium, there is gapping around the mouth of the boot & plenty of room in the toes.

The shoes are immediately comfortable but they seem like they'll break down fast hence I don't expect them to last more than 1 season.

Summary:
They are inexpensive shoes & you get what u pay for. Probably wouldn't buy this brand again."
Cheaply made. Would b ok for a swim suite cover. I returned this item because the color was like a burnt orange and I was expecting red.
"I wear an 8 but 8 was too short, toe hit the front. 8.5 was better but too wide in the heel. Returned both."
very cheaply made. looks cute but we've had it a month and it's already torn.
"Very thin, not the best material. threads of the material already running. If looking for a tote bag for a cheap price - better to buy in bulk from ""duratech group"""
"I bought these to wear at my wedding and they're very pretty... love the color. BUT the heel is 4.5 inches, not 3.75. I didn't want anything over 4"" for my wedding so will probably end up returning them... I'm feeling super annoyed (and disappointed) that the information given wasn't accurate."
Super soft. Like them a lot
"For the money, it is a fairly decent hat in terms of quality.  But it is unflattering and it came with a fold that did not look like it was going away.  I was looking for a hat that would last and that I loved.  This was not it.  But for the price, it's not bad.  I'd view it as a throwaway disposable hat.  One to bring to the beach and not worry about."
"This fit me as expected. By that I mean not great. I wear a 38DDD and I wanted this item to wear as added support for my strapless bras and also to hide cleavage when wearing low cut tops and so far, it works. Not the best material for larger sized breast and I definitely would not recommend wearing it independently as a bra, unless you're wearing two at a time."
"Too small, returned"
It is ok it's not bad not great. Would I purchase again yes if to be worn as a pinkie ring not wedding finger but that's just MY taste.
"First of all, these were my first pair of boot and they were so comfortable. Padding all around the shaft, the heels didn't feel high at all (and I don't wear heels!). Would have been my favorite pair of shoes if only the shafts weren't so big.

Based on the website description, the boot openings were supposed to be 14.5 inches but I ordered size 8 and the openings were 16 inches. The shaft were big even with my jeans tucked in. Had to return. Very disappointed. Now, I'm not sure if the openings will go down with the size but they're 16 inches for a size 8."
little cheap looking but it looks like picture
"the print of the dress is nice, but the dress fits way too big. We ordered a size small but i think an x-small would have fitted much better.
115 lbs 27 waist 5-3 36b
received at a promotional price"

Too short for size 10.5 when ordering an extra large and the sole creates either ankle instability or discomfort."
Fun.  Thin though.  Don't expect them to last.
"Meh. Maybe I'm just too busty. Gave it to my sister, she had luck with it."
The shoes are comfortable but they are really too large.  I regret not sizing down.  The shoe is made very well and I like the rocker bottom.  I would definitely suggest sizing down.
Liked the way these are constructed but they were wide for my feet. Had to return them
I usually wear a size 7 but bought a size 7.5 and I can't even get my foot into it.  I would recommend buying this shoe only if they have it in a size or even a size and a half bigger.
"""Grandma"" short. Extremely large!"
"This would be fine for a child, but it looks pretty cheap.  The manmade ""opal"" in mine looks like it is chipped on one side, but it just isn't a great quality.  I got this from Amazon for free  in trade for an honest review, but if I had purchased it I would have returned it.  It does come in a gift box, but I would have been disappointed to receive it as a gift."
These were very cute shoes but the width of the shoes was a little thin. I returned them because my feet hung over the edge. And I didn't think ordering a size up would help the situation.
The waist is too small. Might send it back or give it away.
"I read other reviews saying to order a larger size, so I did, and I ended up with does way to big. If they fit, I'd really like them."
"So cute, I really like the look, but I haven't worn them much because they aren't as comfortable as they look or as I hoped. I wear a 9.5 and the heel rubs and made blisters on the back of my heels after the first time I wore them."
After about three weeks they began leaking through the soles. Super cute though
Their doing ok so far but they are fashion socks and I don't think they'll last super long.  Couldn't be the price though.
In theory it works but this is cheap and many of the pins kept breaking
The problem with the shoes is they rub between the toes!
"This wig is very short in the back and long in the front. I ended up having to cut the front so it looked more like a chin length bob. Otherwise it looked really weird. I would also recommend a hair cap, this wig kept slipping off my head all night long."
"i found these boots to rub on the inside of my ankle. they also appeared to be too wide for my foot.
i liked the look but didn't think i would get much wear out of them and for nearly $200 i expect more from a boot so
i returned them,"
there sorta uncomfortable to wear and deflate by them selves leaves you lop sided
"I wasn't that happy with these ""Boots"". although, I am wearing them.  They fit, feel and behave more like high top shoes.  I had to purchase Arch supports to make them feel more comfortable.  Do not wear thick socks, as they will cramp your feet."
Shirt actually fit well except for the neck was too big. I felt almost as if i had a ladie's shirt on.
"I ordered a men's size large  but it looks like a boy's size 14. The sleeve length is too short and also the torso. Maybe it's Asian measurements. It was for a secret Santa gift for a Co worker who is about size medium. And knowing that designer clothes basically fit skinny models, I thought I'd order one size up. Other than that, it's a nice purchase. Since I had to buy something else as a gift, I have not decided if I'll go to the trouble returning it."
"I bought the medium, but the arms and shoulders ran larger than expected. I like the jacket and will buy a small, but I'm worried that this will lead to a good fit in the arms and shoulders while being too snug in the waste. We'll see...

Update: I did exchange this for a small after my initial review and, as expected, the arms and shoulders fit much better but the stretchy wastes was too short and tight. This jacket might fit thin body frames well. I'm a small guy, but naturally thicker in the arms and waste."
not what i was looking for. would prefer a little smaller
NICE COLOR AND WEAVE.  TOO BULKY.
"They will be on for school with a undershirt, but material is way too thin to wear without one. Will not buy again"
Returned. Not worth the price.
"Great fit on my legs, thighs and stomach.  Small fit on the waistline. Excellent workmanship. Kudos to the USA makers."
Cute but not super soft.
"I love the bag, my boyfriend has the black one and it never shows dirt from the airline belt etc.  My red bag looks terribly dirty after just one trip!  It holds EVERYTHING.  I totally overstuffed it and the zippers didn't break and the stitching was fine.

I recommend this back in black only."
Bought the wrong width..but its okay
"This is a beautiful dress made with quality fabric.  It is skin tight but the material is not thin.  I love the lace over the beige.  Unfortunately, since the material is tight it is unforgiving and my various squashy parts are accented right alongside the curves.  I will have to return it.  It is not a style that works with my body type."
"Nice socks, but started pilling like crazy after a few washes"
"I like them, they look nice, but they are a little to loose at the top... but they still look okay"
"My kid says they're comfy and they fit just fine, but they're falling apart awfully fast."
"These look adorable. My only problem is that the top its lose (which I like) and the bottoms are small. And by small I mean, leggings tight and are short. Almost as if I ordered a size 6. (I ordered a size 8) The pattern is adorable and although my child will wear this still because even though the pants are super tight they are still comfortable due to the fabric being elastic-like.  I feel like the top was the accurate size but the bottoms are another size. There is no sizing on labels they just came in a plastic package that said size 8 on package."
"Nice fit and fabric. But be warned IVORY is NOT WHITE. It doesnt go with white. It is clearly in the offffff white, family and appears yellowed next to white pants. So it has limited usefulness."
The shoes are a little long - but I like the memory foam base. I wanted a shoe that can slip on and off easily and these fit the bill.
"The elastic on the waist is very uncomfortable. Kind of cuts into my waist. I like the look and flow of the skirt, but don't like the fit of the thin elastic, I have to keep moving it up and down (waist line/hip line) throughout the day. Happy to get home after work and take this off."
But will like it once altered
"Havent worn yet, but disappointed that they're so long.. thought they were 18. Which I suppose is my fault, even though the length changes with color... appear to be nice quality"
"i am usually a size 7 or 7.5, went with the 7 and its a bit big, if you are an inbetween size like myself (i tend to do a 7 when a half size isn't an option and 8 is usually too big for me). Otherwise not  bad."
"When you order this bra, you should order 1 cup size bigger than you wear due to the padding in it. Other than that the bra does conceal what it is made for."
"Do not feel stable on feet. Tends to move around, especially if driving.  Have them tight, but heel wanders. Okay but would not buy again. The NuBalance feels better on but there is a portion in the arch area that seems to move randomly.  Do not know if it will be a problem in the future.
Had both brands before and not sure if made in China or not.  May be the QC is not as accountable. Have a high arch and this is lower than needed."
The material of the polo wasn't very good.
"good, looks nice"
"The Laces are good, they fit well, but they're very stiff. Maybe a bit of over waxing, because they're very brittle. They do the job, but it feels like they'll crack under your bending and looping of them."
"Fit great,well made, not the warmest gloves however. If it's in the 40's your ok."
"This fit as expected - I am 5'5"" and it just grazed the floor. I just didn't like the look on me. I am very curvy and it made me look 2x bigger."
"The stones on this don't really form a heart, it looks a bit strange to me, like half the heart melted.

The materials and workmanship are good given the price, If you like the design I'd suggest picking it up. The wife really liked it."
"For narrow feet, runs small too, i normally wear 11 and from what I read from the reviews I bought a size up, still too small, excellent grip! no support, but then again they're not designed for comfort but for getting the job done. Great shoe for narrow feet"
"If you have a long torso, this is not the right size. I'm a 38"" bust and 33"" waist, 65 1/2"" torso. I originally ordered the XXL and it was too big in the bust and the waist was as tight as it could go. The waist was comfortable, but I wish I could have been able to tightened it more. The length was perfect.
I ordered the XL instead and it's too short. It did fit everywhere else, but in the length.
My friend had the L. The L and XL are pretty much the same length. The XXL is 1 1/2 inches longer all around, than the XL or L.
XL measures 10 1/2"" on the side from center of bust, but under arm and down. 15"" from the just over the nipple and down. On me, this came down just to the top of my hip and my hip stuck out. It wasn't pretty. This was for a costume, so I kept the XXL and had the bust taken in as best I could. If this was for fashion, unfortunately neither would have worked for me.  It is a very pretty corset. If you can find the right fit, it will look beautiful."
"Quality is lovely. However, as a 34F, I had the same problem with this as I've had with every other bra recently: the cups are too small. This would make for lovely coverage and pleasant support for a B or even C. As an F, it kinda wears like floss, and my boobs flatten out the sides, and fall out easily. I guess I should stick with bandeau coverage type lacey comfy bras!"
"These shoes are great looking, and I love Merrell lace-up shoes, which can be tied to properly fit narrow feet. But this particular pair is AT LEAST one full size too large. I ordered a half-size down (from 9 to 8.5) as advised by the reviews, but it was still way too big. If you have a high instep, you will probably find the fit to be fine, but for narrow, flexible, flat feet, this shoe just won't work. I loved the looks, the color, and the nubuck, but I stepped right out of them when I tried to walk."
"They look cool and they are certainly conversation pieces for occasions like July 4th. But they are not what I would classify as ""large"" sunglasses and they certainly aren't the sort of shades you'll want to wear for their effectiveness. All in all, they are snug fitting on my big dome, but they are cool for the dough."
"These fall off really easily. They've fallen right off my one-year-old's hands while we are out walking (without her tugging on them or anything). Like the fleece for quick trips in the car, but definitely not worth $15."
"Body too small but sleeve, collar were correct size."
"The band doesn't look as soft as seen in the picture. After wearing everyday for four months, the band is still quite stiff."
"I returned this because it was a bit large, but needed to wash it before returning.  Unfortunately the dye ran all over everything and the skirt started to fall apart.  Not a favorite item."
"They were too large and the size 8 was too small , it seems to me that they are not made the same as they used to be very sad because I love the old ones I have and need new ones  , maybe will try 8 when they are in stock and try to stretch them"
They are very nice. My a daughter will really love them.
Cute...sexy..but uncomfortable. I used to wear a similar style when I was a dancer....they had springs in the arches...company went out of business....boo hiss...
"For a very small wrist. It's cute.
The price was 12$ and that's what you get."
"They ride up a little bit, but other than that they are very comfortable."
4 was too small for our toddler who usually wears 3t. Think 5 might fit him better.
Sweater is a touch more casual than I wanted. It is silky and lightweight. I will wear it but not with dresses and skirts it is a bit to casual for that.
"The comment title says it all: for a slip-on shoe, it's just too loose for narrow feet. I really would have kept since they are good looking."
"More of a tunic than a shirt.  I ordered mocha what I received is a dark muddy grey.  Not even close to the color pictured.  I undersand some variation in color but this is very different.  It came with a black necklace made of super cheep plastic and it is so ugly, even my 6 year old won't use it as play jewelry.
On the plus side it is comfortable and it arrive 2 weeks earlier than expected."
Little shorter than I expected
"These Sweatpants were disappointing, first of all they were way big and the legs are HUGE. The rise is shorter than normal also.  I will NOT be ordering more!  They are a real heavy pant however...that is good."
"super cute on my daughter, but the shirt is way too big while the pants are a little short. Sizing is just off."
"These sandals are of good quality, but not good as far as all day comfort. The worst thing about them is the heel which is not very steady due to it's cone shape. There is not adequate padding in the forefoot area and heel. I can't wait to throw them off my feet at the end of the day. Now I only wear them if I know I won't be walking much because I like the style.  I definitely won't be taking them on any trips!"
"I ordered this as an accessory piece for a costume. I had to wear the costume for 6 hours at a time each night for 6 nights (haunted house). By the end of the second night, my finger wear the finger cuff wraps and my wrist where the bracelet wraps turned brown. The brown came off my skin after a good scrubbing, but the bracelet itself didn't really change color. It served its purpose, it is made from cheap material, and is good for a costume but not regular jewelry. You get what you pay for."
"Received this ring today.  Quick shipping and the ring looks great.  It's definitely a ""guys ring"" being both thick and heavy.  The only concern is I have always worn a 12 and this ring is much looser than any ring I've had in the past.  I've worn comfort fit ring before"
too small for my big head lol
"I ordered the green and they were teal, which did not fit my need so I returned them."
"The shirt is very thin and has a lot of give, but it does run small. I will most likely keep this but go back to purchasing Lanmo brand it fits much better and cost is only 1.00 more."
This watch is beautiful and comes with two straps. The problem is the strap is not long enough for me. The strap fits on the last hole and is tight. My wrists are not overly large either. Very disappointed.
"Giving them an OK rating so far. Just got them so they are not broke in but the first wearing these are not comfy. The way the sandals feel when standing on them is not very comfortable. Im hoping they will break in better.

The build quality however appears to be above avg and so I will keep them for now."
"It looked very cheap, and ran very small!  I ordered a XXL and it fit like an XSmall!"
"Smaller than I thought so had to return, but seemed comfortable!"
"I was disappointed with the quality of the wallet. I have had 2 of the same wallets in the past 10 years , both of high quality, that is why I ordered another one when my zipper was wore out. I will look for another brand now because I know this one won't last."
Comfortable with the purchase. Quality is good. Was as seen.
It was a little shorter than I thought it would be.  It was a gift and the recipient loved it.
"I purchased these in a 10 after sliding around in the Mafate Speeds that I got in a 10.5. I wear 10.5 in almost every other shoe.

Overall the fit is okay, a little narrow in the mid-foot but the toe box is KILLING ME!  Blisters on EVERY toe across the top and on the side of my pinky-toe.  Even when I'm just walking in them I get blisters. 2 pairs of socks ... you guessed it, blisters. I suffered through a Trail RAGNAR in these and they did their job in keeping my stuck to the trail, rocks and roots like glue but my feet were destroyed afterward.  I have never had this many problems breaking in or being unable to break in a pair of shoes.  I purchased them for the extra cushion after having 4 reconstructive knee surgeries and they did protect my kneed from bad impact for 8 miles of downhill so I'm giving 3 starts for grip and cushion but I honestly don't even know if I can keep these for casual Friday wear.  Hoka take note - fix this and people will knock nevertheless over for these!"
I like the boots. The problem is i have to pull up every 3minutes the calf is wide. Looks silly hanging fown
They were the perfect size (I wanted really big hoops) but they were extremely uncomfortable.  So much so that I couldn't wear them so not worth the money for me.
Haven't warn them because of the size being just a little large. Nervous that a size smaller may be too small :(
They look great but I cannot wear this type shoe anymore so I gave them to a friend.  wish they made the z sandal in this print
These shorts are like thin swim trunks for the lake or beach.
"It is very difficult to get the creases out of this hat once you receive it. I have never gotten mine to look like the picture. But I am not one that cares so much about the look, I bought it because I am very fair skinned and didn't want to get burnt. For that, it works. Kept the sun off my face and neck. However, if the wind blew I had to make sure I held onto it because it didn't fit my head. There is an elastic band but it was uncomfortable to wear."
"The shoes are very pretty.  Unfortunately, at the end of the day, the feet hurt.  They don't have much cushion."
It a good dress for going shopping in or lunch in....the black top hits just under the breasts. Not at the waist. For me this doesn't show off my figure as from the side it doesn't sit close to the body. But if u need to hide a bit of belly this dress will do that for u! The material is good. The top is not very stretchy so watch ur sizing.
Arrived in a timely manner but disappointed that 4 of the headbands I received were the exact same shade of pink.  In all I received 5 pink headbands and 4 blue.  Not exactly an assortment.  They are soft and stretchy and should comfortably fit my daughter for another one to two years.
A little tight - but seem to work fine.
Not as good as it looks but its alright
It is too hard.
the shoes look really nice the problem its the zipper its stuck doesn't move up so i cant even wear them also are narrow you got to have skinny feet to wear them if you can manage to close the zipper
"Pretty, but too small and I ordered the larger size. I gave it away."
The hat arrived over a week later than expected and was also smaller than expected for a one-size-fits-all hat. Despite that it's warm and didn't come damaged. The price matches the quality so far.
"I'm keeping them b/c I didn't return them right away.  Yes, the foot bed is like a yoga mat.  It's also completely flat like a yoga mat and I don't think I'm doing my feet any favors by wearing these."
"It came quickly and in good condition, but it is essentially just a suitcase, so if you're looking for a backpack with which you can separate, organize, and/or easily access things like you might with a school book bag, I would recommend something a little different.

The straps are all a bit annoying, honestly. The chest support strap broke INSTANTLY, which frustrates me, and once you pull the backpack straps out, there's no way to re-zip the compartment from which they came. Plus, the straps are way too long, so the excess strap hangs down and gets in the way. Also also, the straps on the side have to be undone to access the insides, which can get annoying."
Nice looking pearls but the string is tied too tightly. The necklace will not hang evenly. What do you expect for $35 though ?
"I need to look back at the sizing, I bought a large and it is not even close to fitting around my leg or a boot."
The hat is excellent. A touch small for me but very wearable. I know next time to go for one size bigger.
"sizing is incredibly small, but these are well made and seem solid. Now if the accountants could figgure out what a 4XL size is, I would be great."
I really wanted this shirt to work. It's so cute on the model! The material is very thin. It needs an undershirt and shows every flaw and bump possible.
Perfect size for my 10 year old. The opal inlay is not as apparent as in the photo.
This dress is Red and PURPLE! Not red and black like the picture shows. Also it's made out of bathing suit material. I can't wear it the way I planned but it does make for comfortable p.j's.
"I ordered a size up and it is tight against my small bosom. Order two sizes up, at least. Is is not as flowing at the bottom as the picture and it barely goes down to my waist. I, also doubt the fabric content and will be returning it. If it is silk, it is charmeuse silk which is very expensive, so I bet it is polyester."
"I'm giving it to a cousin , It will fit him."
look cheap and are too big
"I bought this to use with a costume.  The quality isn't great but it was cheap, so I wasn't expecting it to be great."
It rips easy. But otherwise it was comfortable and nice.
"An 8 in most Croc styles is a good fit for me but the 8 in these was just barely wearable. They're so darn cute, I wish they fit better."
"Wear these everyday. For fit, I went a 1/2 size down because the toe-box is a bit large. Overall. great fil"
"Kinda thin. But looks nice enough, a little bigger than expected."
"These are a quality boot. They are made from a decent leather like material that doesn't feel cheap and doesn't just peel right off. The bottoms are rugged and help greatly with traction. My main issue, they are a bit too high for my daughter. She is almost 4 years old and I ordered a size 10 which is one size bigger than what currently fits. When we slid these new boots on, they actually covered over her knee, but they aren't designed to be worn over the knee, because the back of the boot is solid and can't bend. So, as she walks, she looks a bit like a robot and I imagine that she may get blisters. I'll have to wait until she grows a couple more inches before I'm comfortable really letting her wear them. Hopefully she doesn't outgrow the size of the boot before the height matches up. I'd tell the seller to shorten the boot by at least and an if not two or three. Perhaps my daughter just has short legs, but I've never had issues with any other riding boot."
"I love the color of this skirt and it fits well; good size and a nice hip hugging shape. Attractively free below the hips. It's thinner than I expected, but I guess that's probably for the best for summer time anyway. Not sure yet if I can get by without wearing a slip. The stitching is very poor; threads hand about and some stitches are loose. I estimate that it will last 6 months or so with weekly to biweekly wear and washing. However, I guess you cannot expect exceptional quality for such a low price. Would recommend to others with the understanding that you get what you pay for in terms of quality"
"These are a bit small and I was going to return them, but after trying them on the second time, I realized that they will stretch. They are a decent flat for the money. I don't expect them to last longer than one season, if that."
"If you have a big bust, this may not be for you, or buy a size larger. The lining in the inside is a bit form fitting. I'm a DDD/F and the lining kept riding up. It's a cute top though. Great to wear for work with a cardigan or by itself."
"I bought these for a Turanga Leela costume -- and they looked perfect! This is where I attached my cyclops eye. But sadly, somehow they managed to pop open at the seam above the nose after about an hour of wear. Luckily, I managed to use scotch tape to hold it together over my nose for the rest of the night. Sad! They are a great addition to a cyclops costume and they'll fit a small lady's head perfectly. Just be careful. Unfortunately, I'll have to return these and figure out something else for this costume in the future."
"Ordered a size 7.5 after reading reviews (thinking they run small), but had to return and will order a size 7, which is the right size."
"Perfect fit (somewhat slim or modern fit), perfect material (didn't shrink), and awesome design. One of my favorite t-shirts.

August 2017 Update:
After multiple laundries this shirt shrunk and material quality just thinned out. I'm changing my ratings from 5 star to 2.5. You will get at least six month's or less, before you experience these issues."
"Shipped quick! Appears to be good quality material and well made. I ordered another dress with a solid pattern, but a size larger. My wife wore it to Church last Sunday and received a lot of compliments."
"Used this at our wedding to hold the rings.  It's not very well made and the lid doesn't stay closed and it went into the trash after the ceremony, but it was very cheap and looked nice enough and we were happy with it :)"
"Feels awkward and you are left with your breast each pointing to the side.  Don't expect them to be front and center.  Does not have very good support.  The seam that splits both cups runs right along the nipple and will end up chafing.
It fit as expected size wise.
It was not for me."
"Not as comfy as I hoped, love sketchers usually not sure about these probably won't keep"
"This skirt has a nice pattern. It fits, but very awkwardly.  It really doesn't flare out, like in the picture.  I had to send it back.  I think this skirt would work for a size 0/2.  I wear size 4/6 in skirts."
Bought a bunch of asics wide (4e) over the years. These are not as wide. Sneaker seems fine though.
These were a good price but a little small for my baby. The legs are a little tight since she has thick legs too. Would not recommend unless your baby is on the smaller side.
The earring was nice but did not like the closure . It was hard for me to close the earring. I returned the product.
Runs a bit small. Order a size up
"Bottoms are too tight, top is too large but part tgat loops around the neck is very tight and thin. Awkward fit."
I'm going to give it three stars because of the zipper. It's absolutely sexy on I'm not gonna lie but that zipper is just horrifying miscarry being where it's located it really does it down and to boot it's made out of metal why would you do that? In such a sensitive area I would expect that to either be plastic or just for looks but it's an actual zipper. I'm scared to wear it again. Yup!  I honestly wish they had made it in plastic zipper and if you do read this and you make it in a plastic zipper please contact me because I'll buy it immediately thank you !
The quality is not comparable to the brand products in the same price range.
To long but good product.
Can't ware!
"I took note of other reviewers' advice about the tightness of the waistband and bought a size larger than the size chart suggested. I'm surprised at how much I like these pants. They really do look like jeans and are very comfortable. They are a tiny bit long, but as I have short legs it wasn't unexpected.

Edited: After washing a few times, the side seams don't lie flat. I still like the pants, but I'm less enthusiastic than when I wrote the initial review."
"The nato bands are fine, with enough holes to fit a variety of wrist sizes. Looks nice for the price. But the spring bars that came with the bands were not long enough to fit in a 20mm watch, I had to order a separate set to actually use these."
"So the plastic handle pops off easily, but the umbrella serves its purpose and hasn't inverted itself on me yet."
The button holes look like they were just cut into the sweater with scissors. The buttons are really loose and feel like they will fall off at any moment. Sizing was a bit small.
"Super thin, I mean read right through them thin. About a size to small."
"My daughter is small and a boys 12 or 14 would normally swim on her but this just barely fit.  It would correctly be sized a girls 12 or boys 10.  The elastic waste with out stretching it measures 23"" and the inseam from crotch to leg end is 24"".  Needless to say it is short on her.  The front cover says the model is 52"" and 61 pounds.  This is what you need to see if the Large will fit your child."
"These aren't the best quality, I think I will stick with JCPenny or Target for shoe shopping. Online just doesn't do the shoe justice."
It's a bit too large need to make adjustments to the breast area... other than that it fits fine... Love it and will be buying again... count on that!
Awful material and made super small.
Seems as though the Large size in this is really a Medium.  Ordered 2x & received boxes w/Large labels placed over Med. size indicator printed on the box sides.  Had to return all.
"The description says it's 100meter water resistant, the watch is just 50 meter water resistant. This one of the most important features that I look for before I buy a watch."
"Not a dress unless you are under 5 feet tall. Not shaped like in the photograph, no flare, it falls straight down from shoulders.
The good thing, it is light and breezy! Very comfy but not something I would wear out of the house! For the price it is a great long top for a hot day!"
"While I like this tshirt now, it took a bit of effort. I don't know if it was too much starch in the material, but this shirt was very odd-feeling, bordering on scratchy, when I received it. Took quite a bit of soaking in a salt/vinegar/baking soda solution, then washing it and drying it to get the material even close to being soft."
If you have a narrow foot these are not for you.
"Seems to be a good product overall, but I just wasn't' sure about the durability of the outside material. Ended up returning and getting the Delsey Chatlet luggage instead!"
"I love the idea of these. They are well made and warm, but they fall down. I can't even make it from my car to my office without them at the knees."
Really unflattering in my opinion.  It seemed to need more shape.  I returned.
So disappointed that this dress didn't fit me well after seeing some great pics.  I have a small waist and for me this was incredibly BAGGY in the entire mid section - baggy does not suit this style at all.  It does look similar in quality to some dresses by another designer (V Camuto) that are in Macys - really not too much difference - but I had to return because of the fit being terrible.  I ordered a small -- i'm kind of inbetween XS and S - so if that is you too - I would go SMALLER to XS.  Another odd thing was that the tag on mine was Completely intertwined into the zipper - so I had to cut the tags and pry them from the zipper before I could even try the dress on.  Looked pretty otherwise if it had only fit.  I didn't have time to try the smaller size to know for sure.  I do think that the design on the tummy looks like it accentuates a tummy rather than minimizing -- think they could have come up with a better design pattern there.  Don't know anyone who wants tummy to look bigger.
"Fit ok,not very comfortable"
"The fit of this top is good, the little floral design gives it a feminine touch. The cut is also shapely, but loose, on days when you don't want the snug fit. All in all it is a good running singlet. I gave this top three stars because the neck does not lie flat and rolls out a bit. This gives the top a slightly worn in look, which I don't find appealing in workout wear. I kept the top because the price was right and I would not feel too badly replacing it sooner, rather than later."
"So, as we can all see, in Item picture, there is a logo and name on this hat (CONDOR), but in reality, that's missing, so i find that strange. Its simply a blue hat without any markings or logo on it.
That said, i have a big head, i think, i normally wear fitted hat size 7 1/2, and this particular cap is still big, almost covering my eyes.
So if you have small head with short hair, you might wanna find something else, otherwise this will extend all the way to cover your nose, not kidding.
So, there you have it."
"Had to give it away, was too small"
"Pretty thin, see-through material, but nice and long and perfect for wearing underneath a shirt that's just a little too short"
"These socks are pretty thin, not quite what I was expecting. I am fairly picky when it comes to my socks, but have typically found that the Puma brand works well for me. These socks do not, they're thin so your feet are cold (I live up north) and they feel kind of slippery, not like your regular comforting socks."
Okay value for the price.
"The spirals are beautiful and very delicate, but only earned three stara because they are not true 16mm. Luckily I'm okay with still wearing them, but since they're significantly smaller than my lobes I've gotta take care that they don't fall out."
I can't say too much since the size I got was wrong. However the material is good and the look is clean.
"Three of us purchased this item for an international trip.  Now, two days before we leave, I opened my sealed holder and there was NO pen.  Now we have to go out and find a small pen to fit in the holder.  I am disappointed."
It was a little bit smaller than I expected. It's okay.
"Looks exactly like the picture,But runs small. Wish I  would have ordered  one size  larger."
"I need a wide fit, and I ordered my regular size with the wide width.
I like them but they will not stay on my feet - they slip off the back with every step.
I was leaving for my trip so didn't return them, but got a heel thing to help them stay on.  They still will not stay on so I left them behind and want to return them.  I will try to get a smaller size with the same width and see if that works."
Had to return... Runs way too big
"Super soft & looks cute, but not a great fit if you're busty."
"A little to big ,but cute and can break easily.  I wouldn't buy again."
"Good quality, well-designed but very tight! Didn't use it and luckily body shrank back on its own postpartum. I doubt belly binding would have made any difference."
"My first Lily of France purchase. Not particularly impressed. Material looks too thin and stretchy to provide decent support. And when worn, my breasts jiggled about significantly when I tried jumping. The size L provided inadequate support for my 36Ds.

It's comfy though. So u can wear it for yoga but certainly not for jogging or kick boxing, both of which I do.

Also, although it says Reversible, the stitching at the top of the shoulder strap is obvious so people can tell you've reversed the bra. Though that style is so common these days, it may not matter to you. I personally don't like it when the stitching can be seen.

Since I live in Singapore, it's a waste of money to return the purchases, so I'll be using this, but with another bra underneath for added support.

Well, that's what you get if you aren't willing to splash out on better bras. Serves me right, I guess. ;)"
"When I ordered these boots I had visions of them paired with jeans skirts and daisy dukes - maybe even a dress. However, I don't think that will be happening!!  I am on the smaller side, however I expected the boots themselves to fit much closer to my legs - instead they are quite loose and also very heavy. I thought about returning for a 1/2 size down, but my toe really isn't that far from the end. Overall these are very high quality, just not the cowgirl on her day off look that I was attempting to achieve. If you have small calves and are looking for something to wear with dresses, skirts, etc., keep your expectations low - these might not be the boots for you either."
"It's so funny.  I see so many reviews that say these run small and just as many that say they run large.

So, for my particular seven-year-old, these run large.  Hugely, unflatteringly large.  When she wears them, it looks like she's wearing hand me downs from a larger child.  And because she's drowning in them, she's uncomfortable.

I will say that they are well made.  They wash well and retain their shape (and super large size).  I'm giving them three stars because they don't fit as expected, but I'm going to put them aside until she grows a bit.  They should make nice uniform shorts once they actually fit."
"Not much give, I should have kept looking for real leather, or just bought an 8 wide."
"If you have a tiny head or maybe no hair, I think you are good to go.  It is soft and like cashmere should be, I think would be warm for its weight.  If you have a larger head or hair upon it, save your money."
The bracelet is very pretty but it is very stiff metal. It was hard to open it up enough to bet it over my hand then just as hard to squeeze it to a smaller size so I wouldn't be so large on my wrist. I sent it back.
"I'm 5'9"" / 185.  I should have gotten the 2XL."
Seems little smaller fit for a size Large!
The cup is too big for me...wish some company will make a size 38A bra.
"If you are trying to look like a cheesy magician or part of a marching band, these are perfect. If not, then perhaps try something else."
Love the size. Cards fit snuggly for now. Only issue is that it had visible scratch marks on the  surface. It's quite frustrating to get a new item with visible and obvious defects.
1010 way to small go up at least a size UP. New balance are usually to wide and a half size to big for me. I wear a 5 and after reading comments I thought yes these would fit perfect maybe you should try up a size and half. I didn't because ordered New Balance Ionix.
I love Anita nursing bras but this one did not fit me well so I am returning. I will try another size. I am leaving a comment to note that the brown sugar color is a grayish-brown with blue swirls. It looks quite a bit different than pictured on my screen.
Sharp latch cuts into hand
"Too small and too low in quality, though for the price, it's reasonable.  We returned it."
"I am on a search for boxer briefs that don't ride up and are comfortable. Read about these and their package pouch and thought I'd give them a try.

Firtst, they ride up. Not terribly like some others and the fabric is so thin and soft it's not as uncomfortable but they don't stay put.

Now to this pouch. If I pull these way up into my junk, they are great. Problem is that they don't stay in this position. They slowly work down and become uncomfortable because the band of fabric around the pouch goes from a nice cradle to an intrusive inconvenience.

Possibly this is because of my body type. I have athletic thighs that always make boxers ride up."
"It's acceptable for very casual wear--I use mine as a nightgown.  The fabric is very thin, and the strap adjusters creep easily."
Very stiff. Hard to get things inside since it has no give.
you can walk around for a few hours without having issues but for my feet they gave me blisters all over...but they look cool at the gym ;-)
Okay shirts for what they are used for. They run a little small in my opinion and they are thick and a bit scratchy.
"A lot smaller he expected, but it does work well for quick trips where you need only the bare minimum"
"I bought this shoe because it was similar to one I purchased from the New Balance store last year.  In order to accommodate an insert, I ordered a larger size which is the same size I had purchased earlier.  The toe box was too big.  Some of the shoe's material looks like plastic rather than all leather.  Should I consider making such a purchase again, I will be sure to check out the shoe in a store first before ordering online."
i like these but they run small. they are tight on the tops of the feet
I certainly was disappointed to purchase a brief style panty only to find it is a mere one inch higher than the hip hugger style. It is three inches below my navel - not what I consider a brief. Won't purchase again.
"The mask tears easily.  Buyer beware.  Expensive costume, I would keep looking for another one.  It looks good, but the mask arrived damaged, dealer wouldn't replace it."
This would be the second vince camuto watch i had high hopes for while placing the order. When I finally got it I knew it wasn't what what the picture on here had described. The finishing isn't all that good bu overall t its cool anyway. I wouldn't give it more than a 3 star.
"They are ok, they are straight all the way. No foot shape."
"I mean, I guess they're strictly horse riding boots which I know nothing about.  They may be great riding boots but you wouldn't want to buy them for casual wear because of the huge ugly heel."
More off white than white
its kind of small... It would have been great to have more size options.
not a great quality. but they are fine for a little while.
"The Good: Very warm, almost windproof. Wore this while biking down a hill at 25 MPH on a 35 F morning and hardly felt the windchill.

The Bad: The inside media pocket (for your life-sustaining mobile device) was located way too low, behind the left hand pocket. This creates two problems. 1) While the jacket was open, the weight of my phone would pull the jacket unevenly. 2) While the jacket was closed I had to open my jacket ALL THE WAY to access my phone. I'm not into having to unzip my jacket just to check a text.

The Ugly: I returned it because the fabric weave made me feel like a poetry-writing graveyard-shift security-guard from the twenty second century."
This product is OK.  It was ordered as a gift.  Didn't realize it was being sent from China....
Not up to the quality I expected from Hanes.
its super itchy had to steam it and it is kinda tight not super warm but decent on an autumn day
The skirt is cute but runs small
Pretty earrings although not as 'Swarovski' as I'd like.
"I loved the comfort and the feel of these boots - however after a month of wearing, the top part of it started slacking and slumping down and didn't look that great. It was very wide and loose. Returned."
"I like the size and the features of this bag but do not like the color, Porcini, It is a very ugly and dull kind of taupe, not at all brown as shown in the picture."
Like the shirt overall just way too small. I have same style shirt in different brands nd this one is at least one if not 2 sizes off. (Too small)
Again waiting for cold weather to get here to see how warm they will keep you.
"I'm a woman and am shaped like one -- Ie. my waist is smaller than my hips.  Besides being skin tight (and I ordered one size up), the waist on these is almost the same size as the hips, leaving a huge gap.  Why can't manufacturers make pants and jeans that actually fit women any longer?  I had hoped since these were stretch, the waist would actually fit.  So disappointed."
There very cool looking.
I really wanted something that does not ride up and require constant clinging. This product did not solve this problem.
Faded quickly
I would buy a 1/2 size bigger. the shoes are beautiful though
"They appear to be cotton rather than flannel as advertised, however, the set fits well. I would recommend the set. to my family and friends."
A little small after a few washes.  The elastic waste band is thick and it is rough.
I have a few pairs of Pajama Jeans and the ones I bought off of Amazon fit a little different than the ones I bought straight from the Pajama Jean website....a little snug in the hips and waist but not enough to send back or worry that I somehow put on some pounds.  They also smelled AWFUL!!  I don't know if it's the dye or what but I had to wash these a couple of times and the smell is still there but not as much -- kind of smells like moth balls.
"I tried these shoes on at DSW and really liked them, but chose to purchase from Amazon instead.  When they arrived, they were well packaged and in a perfect sized box.  Unfortunately, they were a little too small in the toe area for me to accommodate a bunion on my right foot.  They seemed comfortable enough otherwise, but I had to send them back.  Returns at Amazon are so easy!"
Comfortable all around with nice sole
Not terribly uncomfortable.
A bit snug but very pretty. Not a great fit if wearing all day.
"I tried this chemise in the red/purple combo, and it is unbelievably gorgeous.  The fabric feels luxurious, and the flower detail trim is delicate and pretty.  I wanted to like this chemise so badly, but it just didn't fit right on me.  I'm 5'4"", ~112 lbs., fairly straight figure, 32A bust, 26"" waist, 32"" hips;  the size small fit me great everywhere except the chest.  The top of this chemise is sewn so that it has two slightly ""cup-formed"" areas that will accommodate a larger chest, and this area puckered on me, much like a too-big bra.  Sadly, I had to return it.  If it was more flattering on a petite/small-busted frame, I would have kept it in a heartbeat. :'("
"This top is huge, I mean tent huge. I ordered the smallest size they offer and although I'm 5'3 and 160 pounds it still fit larger than it looks on the model. I was really disappointed because I looked at this top for a couple months but waited because of the $35 price. I finally decided it was too cute to pass on, but when I received it I knew instantly it was too big. I put it on and tried to find an attractive way to arrange it, but honestly it looks like I'm wearing a tent. I think for a larger woman with a bigger bust size than my 36 C's it might be a better fit, but for my size or smaller you're going to look and feel ridiculous. I'm going to give it to a friend because I don't like returning and being charged the restocking fee. The quality is good and the style is cute, just an excessively large cut."
"I love the patterns and the dress style overall! However, I ordered an extra large (because large is not available) because the first one I bought in a medium didn't fit my arms and across my shoulders, but it was the perfect length and everything else.... But now this one fits across the shoulders but it is too long and I feel like the bust is too low so I will probably have to wear something under it."
"The material for this is NOT cotton as listed I. The description. It is a shiny polyester blend. The color is as it appears & the fit was true to size. Other than the fabric, it is okay."
The material is thin.  I would have liked something heavier.
Like the shoe & fits good through the ball & ties but slips on my heels. Returning them.
this shoes looks very nice with jeans. I made the mistake of buying a 1/2 size bigger without thinking that they are true size. I still love them.
"They were cute and the one shoe that fit was good, however the other shoe was about 1/2 size too small. I have never had this problem. If I had ordered a size bigger then it would have been way to big for the other foot. Very sad, because they were super cute."
I ended up making this a sleep top. The holes didn't stay closed enough for me to feel confident my bra wouldn't peek through in public (I am farily busty). But I love the color and texture!
"Had to return them, they were to wide for my narrow feet"
Xmas gift!
"good quality, but a little short"
"I'm giving it 3 stars because the sizing was off for my wife. There size converts like a size and a half bigger. Otherwise, the packaging was perfect and shipping was super fast."
"Bulky feel and bindingly white...
Really stiff"
"Item looks just like pictured.  I was worried that it would be too small because I got a size small.  I usually wear a size 8 but it was plenty big and roomy. Update- I have never worn it because it does not look good on me, don't like the material. It is more like costume material. Okay for lounging around the house."
"I got this for my 15 month old. He's in the 95th percentile for height and the pants were definitely too short. My poor little guy had to be taken out of them because they kept riding up around his diaper. Also, the suspenders should be pinned or velcroed. They kept coming off of his shoulders."
"I wear a Large, but I saw the comments that the shirts run small so I ordered a 2xl and it's still small!!!  Disappointed,  but the design on the front is nice.  I'm still returning the shirt."
Really nice looking purse but too squishy for me. I wanted one that was a bit sturdier. Returned this one. But it looks nice and seemed like it was made really well. Would recommend if you want soft and squishy in a purse!
"I have a few pairs of Pettipants,. these are somewhat large and only come just below the knee which is fine. I suggest going 1 or 2 sizes smaller they run large. But still feel and look great."
Seems like pretty good quality material but they were slightly big.
Dress was ok. Material a bit too thick for me
"The first pair we received had the loop/handle broken off. So after exchanging them for a new pair we are mostly pleased with them. I would say that they are on the narrow side. My son has wide feet but when it's really cold outside, we want our boy to wear an extra layer of wool socks to help keep his feet warm, and they are a struggle to get on that way. These would be perfect for a warmer wet day, with just regular socks underneath. Less ideal for winter weather, but definitely do-able. My son does not complain once they are on and serve their purpose of keeping his feet dry. The design looks a little cheap, but I still like them. Hence, a 3 out of 5. Nothing exceptional, but good enough to keep, especially when these will only fit for such a short period of time. Note: I also purchased a pair of Hatley rainboots and I would say they are comparable in quality; ranking the Hatley ones slightly better if needed. The Hatley ones had nicer designs, but unfortunately did not have the size we needed so we decided to keep the Western Chief boots. In both versions, I wish they had bigger threads for more grip."
Arrived and was just in a grey plastic bag. Don't seem very sturdy and pull the straps so tight it's uncomfortable. May work for someone with a smaller build.
"the large is a bit puffy in the middle, would be more flattering if it was sewn in a bit at the waist, otherwise, it's fine, cute, whimsical and comfortable."
"I realize this is an adjustable hat, but it's pretty small and would suit a younger kid well. For adults its OK if you're a pinhead. Oh well. Its cheap."
Falling apart quickly good sizing thought
Straps were too tight on top
It boder me in the up back border...
I've ordered other Levis from this same page and they fit fine.  However this pair of black was too small. I'll need to lose about 5 lbs for them to fit :-/
Sole cushion is very thick so very comfortable but it make to feel little bit small.  I recommend to take one size up.
It's just okay.  Nothing spectacular.  Worked well for my 2 year old (it was large on him).  Never wore the mask.
I suggest buying one size larger than you typically would for a better fit.
This one fit close but I can work with the dress because it is not very tight. The dresses from this company are hit and miss with the sizing. I ordered 2 styles and the other dress was too little even though they are both a large size. If I were to reorder I would go up another size for example size 10--12 with curves should order XL not L.
"I ordered a small, and it was still quite roomy. Also, the white slip beneath is basically transparent so, I wear another slip beneath it. Fabric has held well!"
"My toddler and I love Livie and Luca shoes.... except these.  They are super cute, but the leather is very very stiff - not like the usual soft leather found in this brand's Ruche or Juno shoes.  Disappointed."
Package arrived on time but not as described. It was supposed to come with an additional leather bracelet but it did not drive with package. the watch is cute but the corded band keeps coming loose and I have to re-tuck it. Not bad for the price though.
"Like the Shoe, however the Sock the comes with this item is way to small. I couldn't get my toes in them. Great concept though and a comfortable show. Great for working out!"
The bow tie was huge practically the size of the babies head. The hat was the best part. Over all decent for the price but the bow tie can't really be used it's way too big for anything
"I did not send these back but they were filed under ""pajamas"" ... They attract lint and are a bit too soft and thin to wear for active use. The material does not have enough stretch, and kind of bags out after a lot of bending."
well made boot. Had to return to big
Only post gold. Globes are plastic
"This is made out of the fabric that most inexpensive costumes are made out of. No shock there.

The body and head pieces are great, they look fantastic. Make sure that as soon as you get it, you pull the signs out and lay them flat under a book if needed. One of them was folded when we recieved it with a pretty serious crease and wouldn't hang right. Straightened out just fine after a couple days of laying flat under weight.

The foot covers did not stand up that well to moderate use. The fabric is pulling away from the foam that's used to stiffen them. Not a surprise as this is an inexpensive costume.

The gloves are junk. Almost totally unusable as is. The fingertips of the gloves end before they even start into the branch fingers. We were in a hurry so didn't take a lot of time to fix them properly, we just did the bare minimum we could to make them work for a short stage part. If we use this costume again, I will completely take them apart and rework them.

I would definitely not be afraid to purchase this again, I would just make sure I give myself time to deal with the gloves."
"Very thin material but OK for a one time wear.  However, costume is smaller than expected and much shorter than would be expected for a mans costume."
The smaller white stones have started to fall off after just a month of wearing the ring.
I normally wear a 7.5-8 size in womens. These shoes are HUGE. I ordered a 7. Way too big. Easy to exchange to correct size. Will update after I find an approriate size.
"This lipstick went on well, felt good going on, and lives up to the hydrating claim, but it didn't last as long as expected.

My one real complain is the color.  The color (as viewed on my computer which I know can vary) looks like a rich pinkish plum color, but when I wore it it was much more vibrant and hot pinkish and had more of a matte finish instead of a sheen or gloss.  I generally buy colors similar to Whitney so it was a bit of a shock and disappointment when trying this one on.  I guess I also assumed that since it was hydrating that it would have a subtle sheen to it....not necessarily a gloss but not a matte either.

I don't think I'll be getting lipstick online again because there are just too many color variations."
Doesn't fit like expected. The stomach area was fairly loose to be a form fitting garment. That area is the problem area so but it usually the tightest
Dose not look like the picture
I have been spoiled by the quality of L a s p o r t i v a brand boots.  They seem to run about a half size small.  These are very light weight boots and simply have not stood up as well as the other brand I have been used to wearing.  I would not buy these again.
price was right and they were ridiculously soft
Like how it fit
"These are a bit short.  Come to just below the knee, not mid calf."
"Nice shirt, fits bigly but no mention of Benghazi anywhere on here."
small in the arms
Runs really large and I gave them to a friend with a bad bunion. She loves them.
"It is fit as expected in length, but tight and narrow in width."
"I've been pretty devoted to Saucony over the years, and I've gone through multiple pairs of Kinvaras and even tried out a pair of Virratta for a couple hundred miles before realizing I need a bit more padding (I'm a bigger guy at 6'6"" 210). Went with the Mirage, and while I like the shoe, it doesn't feel quite as natural as either of those previously-mentioned shoes, at least out of the box.

I think the biggest difference is that although there is more padding, the outsole on the outer ball of the foot feels a bit hard, even after putting some longer runs in on the shoe. It's a bit hard to describe, but my run motion just doesn't feel quite as fluid with this shoe. With the same drop as the Kinvara, I expected it to have the same feel (with a bit more padding), but it feels slightly uneven (even compared to my Hokas, which are mega-padded, but still feel like the padding is completely fluid)."
It is difficult to put on and the button fell off in the pkg.  I put a decorative pin in its place and modified it so I could slip it on my should and throw the one side over to fasten.  Its good for light weather
"I wear Dansko's all the time in this size.  My feet were swimming in these, with socks, and I had to return them."
Ordered 2 sizes bigger and still tight.
Size width is ok and it's a nice style but shirt is shorter than a Big Tall should be.
"The watch is fine for telling time.  The solar-power aspect is excellent.  Setting the day & date is cumbersome and unintuitive.  If I had it to do again, I'd just go with 'date' (day-of-the-month)."
"I love my Skechers, but these just don't seem to fit like I remember them fitting a few years ago.  They still look great and they're comfortable, but I thought they used to have some arch support and the cushion was softer.  Now there is NO arch support and they seem much firmer than I remember.  Maybe I'm just getting old! :)  They're still cute and comfy, just not as much so as they used to be."
"Overall my husband was pleased with the comfort and look of the shoes However, one of the shoes was noticeably more worn, as if it had been a floor model or something.  He didn't bother to send them back but I would have had it been me."
These Boots are cute as hell but where your toe keeps out the top gets very sore and roll because it is cut tight do not recommend long distance walking in these or standing there's really not much support or cushion in the soul kind of ruined my night when I went out with these because my feet were killing
being 5'inches tall it did not really look has good has on the model. love it anyway
"The shirt is better looking in the picture.  However, the material is very nice.  I have other SSLR shirts, the one with the anchors, in various colors, and it has a different texture to it.  They are all very nice, however, the texture is a little thicker on this shirt.  The shirt looks very pretty in the picture, however the colors are brighter, and perhaps a little too loud for my liking.  Again, the quality is very nice, the colors, pattern just a little louder than what you see in the picture."
No 9.5 available. I bought a 10 that runs too large :(
"I tried a few slippers from a few vendors that looked similar.  I wanted one that would slip on, but not slip off so easily and is comfortable and brown.  I got these and they are very comforatble.  The brown in the picture was unclear to me (maybe wishful thinking) whether it was a shade that I wanted or not - but since it was so cheap, I gave it a try.  I lost on the color bet, but the comfort level and price overrides in this case.  They are a keeper."
"Ran a little small, but overall great jeans"
"Very nicely made sandals. but for me, they are not very comfortable."
"Not very good quality but you get what you pay for. Fit was as expected though, fabric does NOT stretch. Would recommend ordering a size up if in doubt!"
"the good: maroon color is nicely saturated / the blouse is thin and breathes but not so thin that it's see through / drapes nicely on body - it's more loose than what the model shows.  i'm sure they have it pinned back.
the bad: the material is so delicate that little fibers are coming out everywhere. and this is even before i wore it...straight out of the package, little fibers here and there.

nice blouse but a little too delicate for me.  unfortunately, i can't imagine this is a long-term staple in my closet."
"this is a very cute bathing suit but the top fits too small. We 1st ordered a size 12 (because that is what my daughter wears, and she is on the smaller size 12 end) and while the bottoms fit perfectly the top was way too small and didn't look right. We exchanged it for a 14 and did not notice any change what-so-ever. There was no difference between the size 12 and the size 14. It's too bad because other than the top fitting too small, it was a very cute suit and she would have loved to keep it."
"They worked for my Halloween costume but at the end of the night, the socks became loose and start falling down."
Wide size not wide enough for my feet. Had to return. Very cushiony so disappointed.
Not completely happy with it. Just OK
Comfortable but material feels plastic so if you have sweaty feet can be problematic.
Ok. But not what I expected .
"Wore and washed once. Didn't shrink much. The XL is long, too long to wear outside your pants/shorts. Hope the neck doesn't turn into a bacon neck."
"I loved the punchy, coral color of this shoe.  I loved the cutouts.  I loved the design.  I hated that the minute I put these on my feet, I knew that they would give horrifying blisters and would take forever to break in to the point of relative comfort.  It killed me, but back they went."
These socks are SUPER thick.  So thick I cannot wear them with most of my shoes and boots.
"These were just ok for me. In terms of sizing, they're true to size. I usually wear a 7/7.5 and the size 7 in these fit fine. For me though the problem was the actual foot strap- it was way too wide! I tend to have more narrow feet but there was a lot of extra room and they were frankly just uncomfortable due to this. The foot pad was also not as comfortable as some other Crocs too."
"I'm wearing these for my wedding. They are very confortable, price right."
"I usually do ok ordering up 2 sizes on Asian clothing but this top is still too small.  If you are hippy or have a tummy order up 3 sizes.  It's worth it, this is a very cute top!"
"I already own a pair of these, so I knew I would like them. They sent me a medium instead of the small I ordered."
"Vey comfortable but ran small, had to return"
It is a beautiful swimsuit but the material is not so good. It is transparent when you are in the water.
The heel height doesn't match the photo of the shoe. It's much lower. Now I end up with 2 shoes the same color and the same height.
Fits ok. Just very thin fabric was used to make this dress. You can actually see right through it. It is very pretty fabric though.  My great-granddaughter loved it!
Really cheap toolkit
"You sort of have to wear it in, let it form to your body.  Once you do, it's a nice fit.  Good support w/o the underwire.  Very heavy fabric, though, making it a lot thicker than I wanted."
"With the Clarks name, expected wider on an M width. Not."
They stretch out quite a bit and become very baggy by day's end. They have no resiliency. Better to go with another fabric type.
fit is large and somewhat crooked.
Holds my money and my bank/credit/id cards. Hopefully my cards can't be scaned.
We loved the socks but the quality on washes and holes was poor. 2 sets of the socks had holes in the heels or toes instantly and I didn't return them as I figured it wasn't something I could return. I wish they were better quality bc they look awesome.
"It's okay. Quality is not what I would choose. If I tried it on in a store, I would have left it there."
"I can't believe I paid $40 for this! I was okay with it when I thought I'd only paid $20 or $30. I don't think it was worth $40. I'm trying to find my new size post-pregnancy. I got a 30G from another company and the cups were a bit big, so I tried a 30F and now the band is tight. This is a very thin band, so it is pretty uncomfortable, especially at the end of the day. I suppose if you're only wearing it to look sexy and it ends up coming off right away it would be fine, but when you're trying to wear it as an everyday bra it's not ideal. That's what I get for trying to avoid spending $70+ on a bra..."
"It fits well, with good price, but not very good quality."
"I wear a 7 but ordered the 8 because of the size chart.  They were just a bit too large but 7 would have been too small. The issue is that the buckle is really flimsy and after one day of wearing them  I was very concerned the buckle was going to break so I returned.
If the buckle was better made I would have kept them."
"I got this to go under a dress for a family get together, it fit well at first but throughout the day it stretched as I moved and got really loose. Despite my efforts to tighten it and pull it up it didn't help. By the way, I'm only a 34B so I have very small boobs, no way they could have stretched it that much and I wasn't dancing or doing anything too extreme. It did save me from nip slip so I do give some stars."
Its a  nice shirt but it fits a bit awkwardly. I have a bigger bust so I'd have to go almost braless to wear this shirt right. I'll probably end up giving it to a friend.
"This is a nice quality bag. However, I returned it because I felt it was bulky and a bit uncomfortable for me, I want a lighter bag when I'm traveling"
"My wife said these look like shoes from Wal-Mart. I ordered a different color and hope they look better, but they look worse than in the photos. Will update review accordingly.

UPDATE: They look better in a different color. Definitely don't buy the light grey with white on the side. As for fit, these do run small. I normally wear an 11 and 11.5 in Nike (nike runs small), and ordered a 12 in these. They fit just right, very snug, ALMOST a tad small. Also, I don't like that these are not deeper. When I wear ""no show"" ankle socks, the tops of my socks show in these, unlike in other shoes. They are comfortable and light though. I'm not much of a runner, so I cannot speak to them for that."
"Sizing is correct and very comfortable to wear all day.  However, the sheath fabric a bit is too fragile and not expensive looking, actually it looks a bit dirty though it is not. It does not look as good as pictured."
"I wish it had a bra insert,,,,"
"I'm 5'9 185 pounds average build and these fit me kinda loose - the material is nice, arrived quick, like the design but they fit me more like a large than a medium. I might order a new one in a size small to compare."
I will need to return them...too narrow in the toe box area for me.
Nice material but too small.
To thin but it looks good
Love the shirt but didn't fit.
"These are okay, I did not expect the waist line to come up so high or the legs to be cut out so high. Don't think I will buy these again, but they will do."
"Nice dress. Good quality for the price, but is extremely small."
"The dress looks pretty but it has one flaw-fitting around shoulder is not good. The dress stoops out at the back, needs repeated adjusting. I wear it with a jacket. That helps."
good order a half. size up these are slip-on
We used these for a show  and had  to add more wire to all of them as they did not stay standing up
Cute fits a little big for a small
"The tie is fine. It's a little on the short side, and the fabric isn't the highest quality, but you get what you pay for! I'm using it for a Harry Potter-themed cosplay outfit and it suits just fine for that!"
"Found it to be too small and wrinkled from packaging to use for the original purpose I needed it for.
Actually very impressive,  appears to be a much nicer quality garment than you would expect for the price- just go a size or two bigger to be safe"
I ordered these for my son. Knowing that a good shoe is important. Even if he just wears them around the house. He normally wears a size 14 in a shoe. Very hard to find....however these went up to a 13. I thought I would just give them a try anyway. They are actually too big on the! Apparently the sizing is very off. They look to be well made. Just really off with sizing.
Cute but runs small. Had to order 1/2 larger.
"Kind of hard on
 the feet. but this is what I thought after trying them on out of the box, after being in fancy $200 logger boots for 12 hours."
"It fits snug in the legs (fits similar to a straightleg skinny pant) but is WAY too big in the waist. I bought 1 for 2 daughters who are built differenly and both had this issue. I guess it is made for the skinny legged girl with a big tummy? I think that is how toddlers are built, not 9 and 10 year olds."
"Ordered a Toddler 5 for a boy who just started weraing 5T tops. Washed 1 time in cold water. The shirt either shrank or is missized. While it still fit for the most part, it is very short in the torso. The sleaves were still the right size and a goid (to elbow) length. The neck opening was a bit big but nothing to worry about."
"Keeping
It is larger then I expected and not as much bra support as I need"
i purchased this dress in 2 sizes for my girls who were flower girls. The M (9 month) is so scratchy the baby was so uncomfortable all night and the dress kept riding up on her. The 2t dress (worn by my 3 1/2 year old) was slightly big on her but it looked beautiful. It does not ride up in this size and it was very pretty. She loves the dress and wears it once a week (or more) now that the wedding is over she's always the best dressed at pre-school.
"I bought a pair of these jeans from the same vendor but in a different color before buying these.
The first pair were great. These run small in the waist. More like a 33. Disappointing."
We sent this back for a different color.
"My two pair of Go Walks are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn.  I wanted a pair with a little different look.  I really like the look, however, my big toe was hurting after wearing them for a few hours.  These shoes seem to be about 1/2 size too small.  Wishing now I would have returned for 1/2 size larger."
"I bought these for a trip my family was making to Lake Tahoe for our Winter vacation. I ordered it the same week we were leaving and arrived just on time. They kept me really warm. The only thing I would say that I was not happy about is that they fit very snug on my hips, making it a bit different to move around with ease. To help give you an idea I'm 5'3 and wear size 14/16 and I have wide hips so moving around would make the adjustable straps pull down having to constantly pull up and keep adjusting. If I had more time I would have exchanged it for one size larger. Other than that did the job of keeping me warm."
"For the watch itself I would have given four or five stars.  I like the style of it and am fussy about having an analog watch with a light.  However, I was unable to complete the instructions regarding sizing the strap.  In the end I paid a local jeweler to do it - he had a little difficulty, too."
"This is honestly really awesome bag and I love it, but as usual left handed users are left behind and I am really not sure if paying extra $$$ is really worth for me.

1. Water bottle holder is only on the right side. I see no reason why there could not be two water holders, one on each side (its a tiny mash bag)

2. Napoleon pocket is really great, but again if you carry your bag on left shoulder you cannot use it. Why they did not put zipper on each side of the pocket?"
"Although i really like the fit of the legs on these pants and the bottom line the lower belly has way too much material.  It's nice if you have a muffin down low but I don't.  Would like them and give a 5 for price, quality and fit were this resolved in the construction of the jean."
Ended up returning them because they look like men's shoes.  Just not my personal preference.
These shoes were not as comfortable as most shoes from clarks
"Nice but a bit cheaply built. Love the color

Afraid that if you don't handle it with care or over fill it, it will crack open because  a bit too thin.

I guess you get what you pay for that price."
"I normally wear 7.5 and it fits me great! The shoes are comfortable when trying on. I ended up returning them because the style seems a little ""mature"" for my age with the chain on top."
These boots will definitely work with my wardrobe but it's not the highest quality I've ever had. I'm glad I didn't pay a lot for them. Amazon has some great prices.
Received today as gift from wish list.  There are a few white stones missing next to green bird.  Love it other then that!
"I read all the reviews and went for it anyway.  Like others said, it was a specific band and cup size (34D) but it happened to be a size that fit me well enough.  I never buy non-underwire bras, especially not for working out, but this really does its job.  I do have to complain though, that the zipper really doesn't stick at the top.  Most of the time, there is just a little gap.  But once I was working out, and it totally unzipped on me.  I will definitely still use it, even with 3 stars it is still my favorite sports bra (goes to show you how bad some others are, but it isn't perfect.  Oh, and I bought a front close to make nursing my son easier, and it is okay for that.  I was hoping to not have to unzip it all the way, but the zipper pops open and everything pops out, so it's really not much different than pulling up a back close bra."
I nearly died when these shoes were too small. I hated to return them! But the other thing I didn't like is that they don't actually buckle. There's a hook and loop. That seems like an accident waiting to happen.
"Not a bad buy.somewhat thinner,bit I expected that"
"You get what you pay for.  It looks fairly cheap on close inspection, but from a distance it is really pretty.  Received it with one stone out, but I glued it back in and voila! It probably is with the money if you're not expecting it to be something long term in your jewelry box."
"1 arrived defective, broken in two pieces. The other 4 were fine. One fell off during international travel and being checked on a plane but we found it. Bright colors help with visibility on the baggage claim belt."
"Same as the other shirt...more like a Large vs a 2X, but I liked this one so much, I kept it and will try to stretch it to fit. Simple graphics are great."
they'll be great in a few months when she grows into them. very large
"The pants and too big and the top is too small :/ It's cute otherwise, just doesn't fit well on my slim daughter."
"I ordered this for my son who is 6'3"" and long torsoed.  He likes the jacket, but it's a little too short.  It is good quality and washes and drys well.  It did not shrink.  So if you are tall, may want to look for one of these in a tall size."
These are cute but fit really big/loose around the ankles and calf. I have average legs so maybe this is the fit but I prefer boots tighter. Returning these...
It is what I expected for the price.  I just needed something for a short trip where it would be  30-40 and I am used to 90 all the the
Fits small.  If you are large buy an extra large.
I liked the color of the slippers but thought they were a bit flimsy.
The suit is really cute but it is really small. I normally wear a small or medium depending on the style. I ordered a large and that was too small. I had to sew straps on the top so it didn't fall down at the pool
good to check travel items....
Careful when ya wash them as the waistband does not hold up real well.
Rubs small and shorter than pictured
"This shoes were alright, they fit too big...."
Looks pretty on feet. Hard to walk on
cheap made but price is low enough that its worth it lol.
Little bigger than I thought when I bought it.
"it's is just okay, a little heavy for AZ summers"
"Good looking, utilitarian type work shoe. Fit is fairly snug and narrow."
The boots were cute but if you have big legs you might want to try a different style boot
like it but it was too smal
"They hold water in.  They're comfortable and true to size, but once you are out of the water you get to bring a little of the water with you.  I had to take them off to dump the water and sand out."
In the all side but plush.
"Little cheap look, not my favorite buy :-("
"I am 5'8, lean athletic build average bust and ordered a medium. I wanted it to fit not tight but not too loose either and it is just that. Color is gorgeous and it is very comfortable. I have a long torso and am worried about shrinkage from the dryer so I will definitely be hang drying it.

Update 5/23/17: I've had this shirt for quite some time now and after the first few washes it began to lose its shape. I deducted a star for that since the shirt is rather baggy now after washing on delicate in cold water and hang drying. The color is still vibrant but I don't wear it too often since I don't like the way it fits anymore."
"im a 6.5 and I ordered a 7 which fits perfectly. they are narrow in the toes because of the vinyl, but that is expected. im sure they will stretch out a bit."
"i am disappointed in the fit of these shoes.  Though they are made well and look fine, the top of the throat is rigid.  I have worn the shoes for two partial days, thinking that the top of the throat would loosen.  It has not.  Thus, I will seldom (if ever) wear them.  The leather, though lovely to look at and touch, is just inflexible -- no give."
"Too small, am sending it back."
"The tshirt doesn't look exactly like the one on the model especially the open area around the shoulders and it doesn't flare at the bottom. It's  shapeless. Some may like the way it looks on them but I'll be returning it. Not cheap looking, decent. I'm a 16 and ordered the xxl. If I liked it more, I would have gotten 1 size smaller."
"These are super cute and are true to size, however, they are extremely uncomfortable. I like clarks for their comfort and quality but these had literally no support. I can't make it through the work day walking around in these."
"I usually wear an 8, but my podiatrist wanted me to get some 8.5's because my toes were running into the end of the shoe in a size 8.  I ordered this shoe in an 8.5 narrow, however, they are much too short and my toes still push against the shoe too much.  Also too wide for a size narrow.  I like the look of them, so too bad."
about 1/2 smaller
"As others have said, these are not the thicker T-shirts you may find at a retail store and they are a thinner shirt, but they work OK for me.  Would I re-purchase?  Possibly."
If you have any belly it makes you look really pregnant
"I sized up to a large (usually a medium), per reviews. But the fabric stretches out super quick, and the straps are too long, so probably would have been better off with a medium. But I bought them as throwaway shirts for doing castor oil treatments anyhow, so not too bothered."
"Panel is okay, but the hooks were bent down to where nothing could be hung."
"The material of the shirt is very nice.  Super soft and nice color.  The style is great, except the sleeves fit VERY tight around your arms!  I even read the reviews before ordering, and ordered a size larger than I normally wear for this very reason.  I ended up with a baggy blouse with arm sleeves that make my arms look like sausages.  Bummer."
"This purse was way too heavy for me.

If you don't mind the weight it is a nice purse and good quality."
"For the price of $18 something I didn't expect miracles from this corset. I own 2 corsets that cost $200-$400 so I bought this on a whim from someone that swore by the beauty of this corset.  So here's what you're getting & my thoughts:

PROS:
- Only $18 something and very affordable
- Color and embroidery looks beautiful
- Front ribbon lacing design looks unique
- No fussy ""modesty panel""

CONS:
- After 1 wear there's a 1 inch fabric separation at one of the front bones
- Bones are probably plastic
- Corset is only 1 layer of fabric, not 2
- No horizontal waist tape in the construction for cinching support
- Back eyelets aren't reinforced on both sides by boning, just on the lateral sides

In short, the good thing is that the corset looks pretty, & the bad is that the construction doesn't reflect a true corset. Think of it as a garment like a shirt or belt, and that's where I'll recommend this item."
I've been using this purse for about a week now.  The strap is plenty long (I sometimes find crossbody straps aren't quite long enough to go around me comfortably) and I like the color. I almost always have all-black accessories so the red change is nice.  I like the front pocket for things you need to take in/out frequently and the main compartment is fine.  I like the option to put my mobile in the specific mobile pouch.
"Disappointed, it was not what I expected."
When I bought this size from the store it fit fine but when I bought it here in Amazon it was bit large. I'll just shrink it
The hat was ok except for the fit. I ordered it from the size chart and it was too small. I have used the same size for other hats and they fit just fine. I guess it just runs a little small. Otherwise it's what I expected for the price.
"I've got long thin feet that are usually a size 9.5 and a big toe that protrudes farther than the rest of my toes. The Keens were not a good fit for me; I could immediately tell that my big toes was going to be an issue. However, they seemed very lightweight. Probably a good choice for folks with wider feet."
"For what I paid for it, I did not expect top quality and top quality is not what I got. Right out if the box, the net cap underneath starting to unravel. I had to trim it because threads were long enough to get tangled in the wig. Then it knotted terribly and shead even when brushed with a wig comb. Otherwise the colors are bright and it is cute but I think this will be making its way into my 3 year old's dress up corner so she can wear when she's not busy being Elsa."
Hemmed them and like the fit.
I can't really rate these - I should have read the description closer - I was looking for a lined boot - I may have to return them
"Did not really want a bra with ""filling"", but wanted a smooth look. This bra comes very high under the arm. Instead of making this bra so high in the underarm, they would do well to put some side stays instead."
"Unfortunately, not try comfort I was hoping for, given its the easy spirit brand."
"waist/inseam length matches with other brands. Material is a little heavier than I expected, but still breathes nicely. I consider my build to be athletic, and although these pants are not skinny, they are certainly not loose around the thigh."
"They are an alright shoe. I was underwhelmed by the color and they were too large, so they are going back."
"Love these, but had to return. My normal size was too small. Scraped the back of my ankle and put so much pressure on the front on my foot. Tried a size up and they were way too big."
"The straps are not adjustable and they are too long.  Your suit is either going to be too low in the front and sagging bra, or you have to take the straps us or modify the swimsuit, which I intend to do.  It's a lovely swim suit."
"The length was okay, but the arm holes cut up really high into the armpit and was too uncomfortable. Great material though."
Wanted these shoes sooooo badly. Disappointed that the straps are way too wide for my average width foot. Have returned.
"Don't get these if you have wide feet. I read some reviews saying that they were okay for wide feet, but I don't see how. They are extremely narrow. I'll have to return these. Otherwise, they look really nice. I wish they fit better. I'm usually a size 10 and 10 fit perfectly length-wise. I didn't have to order down a half size. Then again, I got the suede navy so maybe they are different than the black."
Bought this for my son's baptism. Good enough for the occasion. Material is a bit rough though. Fabric didn't shrink in the wash.
"The shoe is ok but is more spongy than stable. Unlike the majority of purchasers of running shoes, I actually run. The foot support is not great. Your fit will move around in the shoe as you run. However, it is  still a good but unfortunately not a great shoe."
"I bought a pair of these in khaki and black. They are comfortable, just like all the reviews suggest but because they're made out of this rubber-like material they don't seem to hold up very well. I've had each pair for less than 6 months and they're already showing noticeable signs of breakdown.

Pros:
-comfortable
-stylish

Cons:
-attract dirt and smudges easily (especially khaki color)
-hard to clean (can't put in washing machine because of leather)
-fall apart easily
expensive"
"I have long arms, so I was worried this wouldn't fit, but it does cover the length of my arm and my wrists. I've also washed it a few times and there has been no shrinkage.

My problems with this shirt are that the actual product's colors are not as vibrant or pretty as the image. The flower patters look like dying fall foliage because they are a strange reddish color. The pattern also seems to be the kind you iron on or something because whenever the design is that part of the top is itchy and scratchy.

It's also the material is not warm. If you're trying to buy a Pullover for fall that you can wear without anything else this is way to thin! And in heated indoor environments it doesn't breathe well so you might get hot. It's not a very comfortable top. But when I am sick and already feel awful this top helps to ""fake"" like I put in effort that morning. But I really don't recommend it to anyone."
Wish the zipper opens all the way to the end. It would scratch my phone everytime I put it in and out. So I returned this.
"It's muslin cotton and it doesn't have any stretch to it (personally don't have any other muslin clothes, so it was just something I wasn't aware of.)
It was also a bit tighter in the torso than I was expecting (XL size.)
Otherwise, it seems to be quite fine and is a nice shirt."
"Love cotton for Summer, but the side panels are not wide enough without spillage for the big girls. I will put up with this because finding good bras is like trying to win the lotto, without spending a small fortune. Losing weight anyway, but it is a shame that bras cannot be made with actual women in mind. If the band size is in the 40's, you are not dealing with a twig, you are servicing a plus sized woman, so make a plus sized bra with good side panels and wider straps -- how hard can this be without gouging the customer?"
The shoes are lovely but too narrow. Not sure if they were available in a med width. Not comfortable.
"Bought this for burning man last year. It was ok, seemed a little small. I wasn't able to wear it like shown. The weave isn't as tight as I'd like for the playa but it works to help keep the sun off your neck."
Love bling!
Go 2 sizes up for comfy fit. Look and feel is great though.
"I usually wear a medium, so I ordered a medium. I don't think they size these like maternity clothes. For instance, if you are normally a medium, you wear medium maternity clothes because they account for your bigger than normal state. These bras are sized like normal bras.. that is, you probably need a bigger size than you are used to wearing."
"These are just ok. The arches are too thin, and the size runs small."
"They got a hole in them the first time worn, which is disappointing."
I should have known the it would run small by a size. It seems like online clothes always do. Disappointing because the item looks well made. I was really disappointed.
"Very cute, stylish specs but the heart definition is not very noticeable. I like them very cute and of good quality to my surprise, especially for the price. The speed of service triumphs all, I mean they came really fast. I would get them again simply because of this sellers service!"
Runs large and after wearing a while they got even bigger. I can't wear them. I tried inserts but it makes them too tight at the top of my vamp.
"The description says that they are brand-new in their original packaging, but mine arrived in a beat-up generic shoe box, and were hanging out in there without the TOMS box-- they were just chucked in there, loose.  So, no, these did not come in their original package, which makes them seem sketch.  I'm going to give them as a gift, so now it will look all weird when I give a pair of shoes that have already been removed from their box.  Oh well.  Hopefully they fit."
way too big or my head is too small
"I absolutely fell in LOVE with these boots immediately after putting them on. Not only are they super cute and stylish, they are super comfortable and functional! Needless to say I was very disappointed when I looked down at my boot one day to see that a piece of the rubber on the toe had chipped off after only a couple days of wearing them. I'm considering sending them back. So disappointing."
"When I received this I had to stitch it up on the side due to the hole. Thin material, but not bad for the price. I am sure I will only get a handful of uses out of it before it will fall apart."
"It's an ok shirt. Just looks a bit generic and not as appealing as the pictures. But this isn't a mark against the company because I bought a long sleeve shirt of the same brand and it's super top quality. It's a hit and miss when buying clothes online. However, I'm keeping this because it makes for a nice work shirt."
"Packaging looks nice, but was a little creepy at first. Several ampules with product come in this kit, and fortunately were not broken. I applied this botanical treatment which smells like rosemary on my head massaging it into my scalp where my scalp is itchy and hair thin. I cannot detect new growth,but my scalp is no longer flaking after two applications. Considering the cost of this product, I think the manufacturer would be wise to consider  adding  Styrofoam inserts inside the box to keep this classy, high end product safe in shipping. At the price charged, I'd buy this if it regrew hair."
Top is really long in the torso. I have wider hips so it fits pretty tight. The bust is looser than the bottom so it looks funny. I sized up to be safe but I imagine the small would be even tighter on the hips since its so long. Overall Ill fitting. Im 53 115lbs
"I LOVE how these work with my high arches. They are comfortable shoes. However, this is only the second season I've worn them, and both shoes have multiple cracks in the soles. Deep cracks that go all the way through and across. I'm sorry, but for the cost of these shoes, they can do better than that. I wouldn't recommend buying them to anyone, in spite of their comfort, simply because the cost isn't worth it for the quality. I don't beat my shoes up and I can't find anything I might have done that was too hard on them."
returned these- way too narrow
"36DDD here. Great fit and good support everywhere except the band near (just under) shoulder blades. It cut into my skin. Wanted to like it but that was a deal breaker because it really hurt! I've been professionally fitted for bras and have always measured a 36F but perhaps I should have gone up a size in the band, who knows. Other than that, I did love the wires on the outside. Would have been very comfortable in the cup."
"I usually wear a 6 or 8 and I ordered these in a 10 so I could layer up underneath them, they just fit... I will never dry them for fear they'll shrink up and be too small and too short.  Something I really like tho, is how soft they were right out of the pkg.  I expected the traditional duck canvas stiffness so that was definitely a pleasant surprise.  The front pockets are long, but not fleece lined like I expected. I like the fleece, it is very soft and warm, BUT... I spend more time pulling around on the pants when I first put them on if my long underwear aren't ""slick finish"" on the outside because the fleece will bunch up or get big wrinkles in it that I can feel.  Overall, these pants are just ok.  I spent a week and 2 days with Prime shipping waiting for them to show up, if I'd have found them in a store I probably wouldn't have bought them.  As it is, I'll keep them until I find something better, knowing Carhartt, they'll probably last forever."
however the hem was way crooked and i had to trim it some to hang  straight it being lace that was not too big a deal and at least there was enough for me to do that.
"This sleep tee runs small, particularly around the waist and hips. If you're curvy, I'd suggest sizing up or looking for a different sleep tee. I have small hips and I found it to run small. It wasn't comfortable to sleep in because it was too clingy for me."
These were way to small for my wife and I had to buy her some Chums instead.  They were so small that when she tried to put her glasses on the came lose.
Hard to get the battery cover off and my wrist strap broke off while changing the battery.
I felt these were too bulky looking.

EDITED:

I did a ""pack test""  I compared this bag to my cheap, 4 wheel, ""I don't care what happens to it"" bag which I got at one of those discount designer stores.  I was traveling with carry on for 5 days, which I often do.  I put all my stuff in this bag, and when I did, neither of the compartments were serviceable.  I couldn't even get a tablet in the side pouch, and my liquids would not fit in the top pouch.  I had to transition everything to my other bag for the trip.

This bag doesn't have a lot of ""give"" so when it's packed full, that's it. There's no more room for anything else.  I find that problematic.  Honestly,  think this bag would be better suited to men's clothing and toiletries.  Unless he's a guy who travels with a lot of shoes."
The zipper broke when i opened the first time.  I had to somehow pop it in
"These are beautiful boots, soft leather and a wonderful color.  However, they were somewhat small across the toe area on the right foot.  If they had fit with socks on, they might have stretched; but I did not want to take that chance.  So, I returned them.  (so sad!)"
"I really liked the look of this shirt. I decided to keep it based on the tanktop alone. The top layer was a bit short for my torso. I wore it out anyway and got several compliments but it was a struggle to keep it pulled down. I ordered a med. I'm 5'5, 135ish, with Ds and I often have trouble finding long enough shirts so if clothes usually fit you length wise Id say go for it."
"These were super tight, so sadly had to return them.  They are a cute style and loved the neutral color."
I thought I measured correctly but I guess not.  I was hoping for it to be a little bit longer.  Very pretty just not exactly what I wanted.
"I really wanted to love these shoes, I like the look and the suede, but for some reason the interior fabric just rubbed my feet raw!! I have other Go Walks that don't do that at all, and I've tried some on that do, so I guess it's kind of a crap shoot with these shoes. I'd be nice if there was more consistency, but everyone likes something different so it is what it is. I can certainly see why people love these shoes, they are comfortable to walk in (step-wise), plain, and cute. But they just didn't work for my apparently tender feet. I typically wear a 6 in Go Walks, and the 6 fit just fine, so I'd say order your normal size. So sad to return them!"
it a fairly good watch ...it does its job which is tell time so its fine
We love Keen sandals but these have never been my favorite sneakers. They are way too rigid for kids feet! Not healthy for foot growth at all. So glad my daughter hated them and returned them.
"The print is really cute and the quality is really low. I didn't expect much for under $7 though. I've had these for about 6 months now and the stitching is bad at the ankles but they havn't fallen apart. All in all, for the price, it's a good deal. Just don't expect too much when you order. I'm 5'5"" 130 and they fit well. I had a baby right before I ordered them and wore them right after. A little tight at 145lbs but they still fit."
"The sticky comes out easily, doesnt stay for long"
"I had to go to a jeweler to remove a couple of links, so add on another $10.  As others have mentioned, the clasp takes multiple tries to catch and close ( but once it actually closes, it stays). I've had the watch 2 months, using it every day, and the outer-most rim on the face has turned a copper color, rather than the original silver. (P.S. it has never been  in water )  This is with normal use. The  band has small chipped off white enamel along the edges. I wish the 3 fake timer circles were more subtle, instead of silver. They are shiny and complete with the watch hands, making it difficult to read the time, depending where the hands are located. It sounds like I'm a rough person, but  I'm a 60+ grandmother, who is careful with my things.
I'm hoping this constructive criticism might encourage Ferretti to improve the watch, because I  love the overall fashionable look. No complaints about the way it functions, either.  It just needs to be tweaked."
"Very nice as a top, which is how it is being marketed at the moment.  I expected it to be a dress because that is what it was called at the time.  It really is a tunic top.  Quality is Ok."
"Meh- ok for the price, don't forsee them lasting more than one season"
"These fit fine and the cell phone pocket works well with modern smartphones (not too small).  However, the style is very casual; there's a third seam (very unusual in Men's pants), and almost no crease."
"The quality of the dress is awesome!  I am 5'6, 170lbs so I ordered the XL.  The top and arms fit really well but past the waist, it flared out like a tent.  I tried putting a cute belt around it but that just made it poofy-ier and the material bunch up.  It looked like a pregnancy dress on me without the belt.  I wish it were more straight down, less material around the bottom.  The length was great too.  Bummer..."
The shoe was comfortable but looked ridiculous when I put it on;maybe it's because I'm short. It felt like I was wearing a boat.
The print  on shirt isn't as bright as it shows & it runs small
Good Quality Pants.
2 sizes bigger than we expected! I ordered a different set of bloch jazz from our studio and they were size 5. Size 5 in these were way too big. Order a size down.
"Decent quality for the price for this open knit sweater. It is unexpectedly hi-lo and it runs more like an XL than L for me. I normally wear a M or L and tend closer to a L at 5'8"" 155. I will order a size down and then maybe it will be more fitted like the picture. Also the color is much warmer and a little darker in person."
"Not as comfortable as most of the other ""Air"" products from Cole Haan.  But very stylish and great to wear during the summer."
"Meh. Fits a bit snug, not the most comfortable to wear."
One of her rhinstones fell off of one and weve only had it for a few mos! I usually think Robeez shoes are amazing but that was pretty dissapointing. I plan on contacting robeez and I will update.
"So I read all of the reviews that said this vest was too big, it is too small and really boxy looking"
The seams was sewn on Sideways.
"The front of this earring hangs very heavy and the backs have a hard time keeping up.  After losing them several times I decided to replace the backs.  They look pretty fake because of the size but I think they would be perfect if I had a fatter face.  They are just a bit large for me.  Also, if I had fatter earlobes they might not pull out of my ears.  I might pass them on to one of my chubbier relatives."
"Laces wore quickly and were too short, they barely tied into a bow when the foot was in the shoe. Good cushion and stability once the laces were replaced."
The arms seem tight.
"I can't use it, it's so chunky - not only the clasps of the chains I was supposed to use it with doesn't work well with this thing, but also it looks several times thicker than the chain itself, and it's  course heavier, so it slides down. I would recommend this only for heavy chunky necklaces, not for something elegant and thin."
"These onsies are ok. My main problem with them is they're not stretchy and therefore are difficult to put on and take off. My daughter keeps getting stuck in them and righteously gets mad. And she's not big, they're fitting pretty loosely and look more like a button shirt than a onesie.

The colors are fun though and the cotton is thin, which is good for summer.

I would not buy these again."
Ordered 2 of same item(different colors) on the same date several weeks prior to Christmas n only recvd one item in time for christmas despite both were in stock n  delivery was promised  by the 19-21 of December. Its now 12/27 n still haven't recvd 2nd item! Quality of product was great on the one recvd.
"Scarf is small, not the best quality but I didn't expect otherwise for the price.."
"I like the way the shoe looks on my foot, but the shoe fits to loose because of the elastic fit."
"Comes with watch in display picture.  I wouldn't expect the wrist band to last forever.  Really cheap leather-ish type material. With gentle use and care i give it a year before you have to replace it. band has dull unpolished look,  i want to buy some polish for it but hate to waste money if the wrist cuff doesn't last"
I was hoping it would be loose but the medium was too small. Well made and all but just not what I was looking for.
I gave this an ok rating because the earrings are very dainty in size. I wear big hoop earrings that really stand out and these are so small and thin in width you can barely see them when my hair is down (and it is most of the time). They are very pretty earrings for women who like dainty hoops not for a woman like me who likes big bold hoops that show even when my long blonde hair is down.
"This is a nice, comfortable bralette. It definitely would work best if you have a similar bust/band. For example, I have a small band/medium bust (28F in wired bras) so with the medium in this bra the band was so loose I didn't feel any support, whereas in the small the band is good and secure on the tightest hooks but there isn't quite enough room for my breasts. If I do a full ""scoop and swoop"" I get some major quad-boob. Regardless, for the price and the fact that it's a nice, seamless nude colored bralette to wear under lighter/thinner tops I'll happily keep the size small."
"Ok shirt, much looser than I had hoped. Did not fit as it appears in the picture."
"Not the most comfortable shoes, they did the job, but I would probably not buy another pair."
"little bigger than expected, cute jeans though"
"The earrings are a little heavier than expected.  Still looking for a pair of plain light hoops.  Don't want to tear the hole while she
is still a baby."
"Very nice and will make you look sharp, but i doubt it would last because it's shedding"
But comfortable. ..
Too Big / Material just not right ???
"Fits very good, quality of fabric is really nice, soft.  I don't like the undershirt, fabric is not the same!"
"For the price, these aren't bad sandals. They do run large. I ordered a 9 (i'm an 8.5) and they were huge on me. I ended up giving them to my mom who is a 10 and they fit perfectly. The padding is comfortable so you shouldn't get blisters and you can adjust a bunch of different straps for a custom fit. Just maybe size down."
Collar is high in the back.  Sleeves are hard to roll up...narrow.  Good quality material.  Recommend ordering a size up.
Smaller than actual size listed.
I would advise you to buy a sizs smaller... Yes the cup is that small...
Went with the size chart and ordered a size XL but the dress turned out to be too big for me - so I returned it. Other than that: a nice dress but still more of a 'meh' than a 'drop-dead gorgeous'. Size L would probably fit me nicely but I just didn't like it enough to reorder.
These are nice classic shoes but both of mine are about a half size small
"I ORDERED 5 O THESE BECAUSE OF THE COLORS AND THE PRICE. I HAD O IDEA THAT A 20/22 XXL REALLY IS ONLY A SIZE LARGE IN AMERICAN SIZING STANDARDS. THEY ARE BASICALLY TO COVER UP MY ARMS AND BOTTOM. I HAVE TO PIN EACH SIDE TO THE TOPS OF TANK TOPS OR T-SHIRTS IN ORDER TO KEEP THEM FROM FLAPPING OPEN ALL THE TIME.
VIBRANT COLORS AND THE MATERIAL IS GREAT BUT THE SIZING IS ALL WRONG."
"If where you live requires boots, then this is a fine, comfortable, stylish-enough shoe.

BUT -- it's only OK.  It's not really cute, and it's not really that great as a boot, kinda like a shoe with a taller shaft.  I wasn't impressed."
"The picture show the pendant to be of a normal size.  When I received it, I couldn't believe how small it was.  I had to get out my reading glasses to check it out, and if I do that, it means that the item I am looking at is very SMALL.  I thought it was over-priced for the merchandise I received.  I can't tell people I love it, when I don't.  If it was a normal size, I would love it, but it's about 80 times smaller than the picture you have of it right above.  It's TINY.  I'm sorry I can't be more positive, but it was a big waste of my money."
"kind of flimsy, not rugged enough until you secure to a 2 x 6"
Thought it would be sturdier.
These wedges are good quality Flys but the leather is stiffer where it is doubled and caused blisters after five minutes of wear.  I am spoiled because Flys are usually no break in shoes.  Not the usual comfort of other styles.  I was disappointed because the are so pretty. I had to return them.
"I gave them away, could not wear them, too short"
size is big and my husband where 40 / 30 this long and big unhappy 
A little thin. Snags on things. But pretty much does the job.
"Not what I expected, it didn't even come with a bag for storage.  For a coach bag it doesnt to have much quality."
Look nice. Super cute. Rub on large toe.  I waited to long to try on to return
Normally wear a 2E but these are tight on me. Recommend one size wider.
Fit like a charm but very thin. I have already worn a hole in two of the socks
"This shoes are pretty wonderful. They fit well and look very cute. I was originally skeptical about the style, but it grew on me. However, don't wear these when it's wet. I nearly broke my ass the first day wearing these because I walked on a wet wooden bridge. Not even running, just no traction at all. Other than that, they're lightweight and I really like them."
"I bought this sweatshirt in another color last year. The content was 80% cotton, 20% poly as advertised. The navy one I bought recently is 50/50. So the content is misrepresented."
gave it to my son
They fit however after the first hand wash .... they twist/shrink and looses elasticity and ready to be tossed into the trash.  Cute thou at least the first time u wear them.  Sorry.
I guess they run big. So if ordering go down one size.
"The pants fit as expected and were really cute, but I wore them one time and the black leather part tore away from the pants at the seam on the calf area. The overall quality is not great. I understand that they were inexpensive, but I was hoping to get more than a couple wears out of them, especially since I like them so much."
The neck was sewn to fit a child but the acutal size of the dress was big.  I had to cut it open and wear it backwards or it would choke me.  I think it was a defect.  Other than that good quality costume material.
Bronze/gold version the studs are pretty gaudy. Not recommended. Maybe another color is better.
it was okay. but was small
"I typically wear a 13B and need a narrower shoe and this shoe fits me well.  These are my first pair of ASICS as the soles on my last 2 pairs of moderately-priced Nikes fell off.  These shoes are reasonably priced, nice and light and time will tell how they hold up.  As others have observed the logo pattern on the sides is made out of shiny plastic and reminds me of cheap kid's shoes.  Could do without that part but will mostly use these for yard work so what the heck."
"The compromise is between wearing boots that are too wide in the calf and ankle and/or uncomfortable to walk in and not having any walking boots at all.  This boot seems well made, but is not as fitted as I would like; even when the buckles are as tight as possible there is extra room in the shaft. The leather is not as soft and pliable as the first boots I ever bought, which I loved and kept for decades, and is not of as high a quality as I am used to. I'm guessing the boots of my past are still available somewhere, but at a price I am unwilling to pay. Over the past 3-4 years I have tried and returned so many pairs that I have decided these would do, even though I can't say I love them.  They are not unflattering, but they definitely don't have the sleekness or comfort of my 1969 dark brown soft leather with a medial elastic goring Bandolinos (sigh.) The height of the shaft is fine, and I will use a stretcher on the right foot toe area to improve fit."
Shoes were fine. Not as comfortable as the name implies though. I returned them though because the sole made them very slippery on my wood floors and the floors at work.
"Watch is smaller than expected.  Instructions were wrote for a rocket scientist, but did figure out how to set watch."
"This is definitely for kids who only carry a dollar or two around lol.
Very small for a wallet on the inside. My boyfriend has it as a decoration on his dresser. Another friend used theirs for a while and fins face is gone lol. It got so stretched out too and looks deformed now."
"It would probably be just fine if it were not so tight around my stomach, but I won't wear it."
It was ok. It needed to stretch a bit more in the arm area.
Other color.
"This is a sweet little shoe, but the wide sizes aren't wide enough for children with truly wide feet.  I could tell with just one look that it wasn't as wide as her Stride Rite and New Balance shoes.  Sure enough, she got upset when I put them on her because they hurt her feet.  The wide sizes are best for kids whose feet are just a little wider than a regular size.  It just won't fit chubby-footed kids like my daughter."
Really unhappy with the color...its not as shown..its more orange red... thinking about sending it back...
"It was large, to say the least. The shoulders fit well, the color was nice, and it was nice thick material, but it was like $8 when I bought it and I should have expected better. It's certainly not designed for slim body types but in all fairness it doesn't advertise as if it is. Meh shirt overall."
I ordered 30 inch inseam and they came with a about a 34 inch inseam. I had them shortened because it was easier than having to return them.
Nevertheless I have a butt which looks grand but huge in the dress... I like the dress THANKS
This dress was worn twice and washed then frayed all up the seam.  Poor quality
"I got these because they are just so pretty! I have a wide foot and these shoes are made for narrow feet. I luckily have a shoe stretcher so I'm going to leave them in that for awhile and hopefully they will be much more comfortable because right now I call them ""cruel shoes"" because they hurt to walk in them.  ;)"
Thin material . Cute design though . I wear under a jacket
Pretty but painful!
"Beautiful shoe, well made. It almost fit but I was not able to get the zipper to close =(  Beautiful otherwise. Returned it sadly."
I love the length and the shine of these earrings. The back clasp has already began to loosen but they are still secure.
I don't understand what the point is of the hooks in the back if you still have to put this on by pulling it over your head?
"These earrings are beautiful, but much smaller than they appear. I'll keep them and wear them, just wish they were twice as big."
"They are really cute. They are silky with lace at the toes. I have not have any lace tear like I read in a previous review. But, these have not been ""no show."" I like to wear a liner with flats, heels, and sometimes other shoes for which I do not want socks to show. These have shown in all of my flats and heels. While I like them, and will keep them, I will have to find another product that is truly ""no show."""
"Very nice quality sweater but sizes are off. Get 2 sizes bigger. Plus I purchases 5 sweaters, all the same size and each one fits differently. Also, I have not washed yet so not sure how they will hold up."
Too big for me. I'm 5 4' and 116 lbs ordered the smallest size.
"This was too large for me.  I'm 5'4"" 170lbs and it came down to my knees.  Most other reviews said it ran small so I got the med/large, I should have gotten the small/med.  The belt is super thin, it falls down instead of staying put around the waist.  You can see in the picture-the girl is holding the belt around her waist.  This dress is pretty and I like the hood.  I wished it fit me better"
"I wear large or extra large hats. This was neat, but too small for me. Looks and feels pretty cheap, but not quite as cheap as most costume crap."
Did not fit as other 'Relaxed Fit Wranglers' do
I enjoyed these Crocs for the 2 months they lasted. The grip on the sole wore down extremely fast and left me with a pair of shoes I couldn't walk in if the surface was remotely damp. If I hadn't caught them on sale I would have been very disappointed in how long the product lasted.
"Have purchased about 5 Ben Sherman Tailoring shirts, all slim fit, same size. Strange at how much of a difference there is with the fit. Although I really like the pattern, fits a little large, resembling a full fit shirt."
"Quality was much better than I expected, but I ordered up a size (so I could wear big sweaters underneath) and felt that the jacket was at least two sizes too small. The upper arms, back and chest area were extremely small and barely fit with just a t-shirt under it. Length was good. Sleeves were long. Not as lightweight as I thought it would be, which was nice. Going up an additional size would make the sleeves far too long, so I will be returning this.

EDIT: I wrote my review quite awhile ago and did return this jacket, without issue, due to sizing. Several days ago I was contacted by the company, offering me an additional $5 credit if I removed my three star review from Amazon. I am not removing the review. It's a quality jacket that was quite small, but I want others to be aware that the ratings for this item may not necessarily be accurate if other reviews have actually been taken down in exchange for a refund or credit in excess of what was paid for the jacket."
"It is nice looking necklace same like in the the picture, but it doesn't come with the earrings. Realy dissapointed."
A little more slippery in the water than I wanted. Also shoe laces come undone easily even when double knotted. Probably would not buy them again for water aerobics
This is so pretty yet way way to small !
Trippy shirt.
Feel apart at the seams the first day they were worn.  Had to reenforce them.
"Returned, too large in the heel."
These are decent slippers for getting out of the shower - or just wearing around the house
"Not as pictured.  The back is much longer than the front, so it is more of a casual item. It looks dressier in the picture.  Also the neck is higher than depicted, so it looks odd.  Not sure if I won't return it."
"Cheap and fits weird, but I got it to workout in and get dirty in art class so it's fine."
"There needs to be universal sizing. I order XXL, which should fit 16-18 but unfortunately it's a tad bit tight. I will keep because th dress is hella cute, especially with the zipper in the back."
"Beautiful ring, great detail and awesome price.  But my stone fell out after only wearing it for about 1 month.  I didn't notice it fell out so I wasn't able to find it and try to glue it back in."
"I didn't think I had ordered this size, but this is the size that came. It would fit around my husband twice and is long. Is a nice thickness though and absorbent."
"I bought this for a wedding... it was okay, but the front fit like body armor - it was very stiff. you will definitely need help getting in and out of the dress."
"I am in the middle with this review. While they are quite pretty in the picture, they aren't as great when you actually have them to look at. They look kind of cheap and like one reviewer mentioned, they look gaudy. They come nicely packaged for gift giving. When I opened mine though, one of the earrings appeared broke. The earring pendant had actually came off the earring hook, but it was easily fixable and slid back on. Just a tip to check it first before giving it as a gift. Great for jazzing up an outfit for a date, but still a little high in price in my opinion."
"The color is different from the picture. Here looks kinda beige and the one I got is olive green-ish. Not bad, but not the color I was expecting either."
"This is my very first time making a purchase from this company, therefore,  I did not know what to expect from them in terms of the quality. However, I wanted black tights because all of the ones that I have are beige.

About me:
I am 5 7 and weigh 130 lbs,

I ordered  2 - 40den - Opaque in color black thights.

The package arrived on time and without any problems.

Although these tights had fit me perfectly, and they had that shine when you put them on, I did find that they were not made from high quality because as you can see from a picture that I posted, they have lines on around my tights. However, I did not find any lines around the calf, but with time they may start to form lines as well. If that does happen, I will update you girls to let you know. I don't want you to spend money on something that is not worth the buy.

The bonus gift was socks. They are not made from cotton, but polyester type material.

I received this product for a free in exchange of an honest review. If there was something wrong with this product, I would tell you. Please hit yes if my review was helpful. Happy shopping!"
A bit too large to fit in inside pocket of purse while holding readers.  Otherwise fine.
"Pretty shoe, but runs a little small."
"Let me start by saying the company was great to deal with but the product itself is very flimsy. The battery cover won't stay on as it has no way to click in, I can say this is the case with them all as i bought 3 of them in the same order. What I did weigh seemed to be accurate when i got the battery centered and the unit was easy to use. One of the 3 units malfunctioned out of the box but the company was great about it and refunded my money right away."
"A little on the small size for the hat and the brim is a little wonky but nothing that can't be fixed with a little steam, I hope.  And as almost expected from products directly shipped from overseas manufacturers, a strong chemical smell on the sweatband.  Luckily, I've let it have a few weeks to air out and the smell isn't nearly as overpowering anymore.  Also, the foam, yes, FOAM box it came it was damaged by the hat inside survived the trip.
Those quibbles aside, I can live with the faults because of the price."
"I bought this for my teenage daughter and it is very thin. It is pretty, but could be a bit thicker so that it will not look to ratted when it it gets snagged."
Quality and nicing seem to have diminished a bit.
I really like this belt but the first time I wore it a rhinestone fell off. Then I noticed the clip on the end of the belt it coming off. I can glue it but I would prefer to not have to fix the stuff I just bought. The size is true enough I got a medium I believe and I am a size 6-8. Also I wished the rhinestones didn't stop and went all the way around. Although it does like great with my jeans and cowgirl boots.
"Serve the purpose I bought them for, I wear them at home and they are comfortable. But they do not have the support other mules/ clogs have (see soft walk or Skechers)."
The sleeves are way too long!  I am having 3-4 inches cut off and I have very long arms!  everything else is fine
"This is a pretty tiara, however, it was a bit smaller than I had thought and was a bit disappointed upon its arrival.  It is sturdy and looks elegant but I thought it could have been a bit bigger for the cost.  I would not purchase this again because of the size only.  It is big enough to fit on an adult's head however, it is just that I wanted a larger tiara;  Just preference I guess."
Pretty dress now I must lots weight
"I'm on a weight loss diet, sort of Atkins-ish, and the size 46 pants I bought a month ago are feeling a bit loose. However, these pants are still a bit tight - the pockets bag, if you know what I mean - but are otherwise comfortable. I'm quite satisfied, and at an average rate of two+ pounds per week, I expect them to fit better fairly soon.

The color, however, is disappointing From the screen tint and the ""shale"" description, I was expecting some shade of grey. They actually seem to be a shade of olive drab."
"Needed to return these nice shoes.  Very short and not true to size. The quality of the shoe is very nice, but the fit is a killer."
ordered both ginger and black--black was at least a half a size bigger than the ginger--too bad--so cute and so comfy.  I would have liked to have both colors.
"Really pretty.  Stine us beautuful!! Shank is too long, sticks into ur skin."
"I haven't actually worn these other than trying them on at home as it's June and it's flip flop weather. The looks are great, and the sizing is a wee bit off as I'm a solid size 7 and felt urged to go for 38 and they're a smidge too big, but probably better to be too big than too small. One thing that I don't like about them, and it's a personal preference, is that the heel is solid and clunks - in a way that you make a lot of noise like you're wearing cowboy boots or heels and there's no way people can't hear you not coming down the hallway. I prefer to be little quieter and softer in my footing. I got the grey, and it's a nice colour. In darker lights they could be dark green (nice, not icky). I may change my review in the fall once boot season returns, but overall, these are different from the run-of-the-mill styling, and very cute."
"It is a nice looking costume. However, every time you move it loses hair.  There is black gorilla hair following the costume."
I have had mine a year and the bands are tearing and falling apart at the hinges.  It is fun to have the different colors.
"Using for backpacking and can fit a decent amount in them, and several of them in my back pack. For my wardrobe at least the black mesh is too dark. I can't pull stuff out of my backpack without having to go through more than I'd like."
"I bought these boots for work. I walk a lot and at first they were really comfortable, but after about a month they started falling apart on the inside and outside.  Now they really hurt my feet and I have to buy another pair of boots"
"Unlike the poly tanks by Pitbull, this one is cotton, which it clearly shows in the description.  The cotton is soft, as expected.  It looks okay, but the fit is just not as nice as the poly tanks.  Medium is big enough with plenty of room to spare for 200# guy with 10% bf."
Arch support is not to good. Not good for long workouts .
Definitely not nearly as bright and shiny as in the picture. Disappointed as well that they were packaged in little baggies and not on a earring holder. Cant vouch for the sturdiness of them as they are a gift.
It is Ok a little simple than expected
These are NOT A 35 inseam. If you are buying these for the length...beware! They are not a true 35 inseam...more like 33. They are nice pants but I am normally a 4/6 in misses so I got the 7. They have a very tight fit all over but they do stretch a little by the end of the day. Not quite long enough to wear with heels though and i am not that tall (5'8)
"Quality seems superb. So Im giving it 3 stars. I have ordered two others from Yianna and love them, but needed a smaller size, so I decided to upgrade to the more spines. This one is much smaller and tighter than the others were. So Im just gonna exchange this for a larger size."
Very thin but good for hot weather. Too large but washed in hot water improved the fit.
"These gloves are just what I wanted, except for the size. Too small. As others have noted, the one-size-fits-all, doesn't always. I wear size 7/medium glove and these are quite tight. Almost like a 2nd skin. Not the fit I'd hoped for. I will still wear them, but not as often as if they were a little looser. The best feature is the open end at the finger side, instead of finger holes. Much better than the gloves I've tried with finger holes. The fabric is thin, soft, cotton. The ruffle and decorative buttons are cute, but I cut off the buttons because they caught on my sleeves. A great product, that should be made in other, larger sizes."
"These were bigger than I had anticipated. But maybe that's my fault for not reading closely enough. I've worn them, but am not particularly fond of them."
"So soft and comfy, I love these. Unfortunately the top of the band began to have elastic strands come out and fray the top. Still works, comfortable and attractive but won't last like previous boxers."
Very cone shaped. I'm not a fan
"Was a wrap style ring, not a solid but still a good ring.  Would suggest a better description."
"I really wanted to like these shoes, but when they arrived one was damaged.  One of the bows was broken off and due to arriving without a box, they were somewhat smashed.  They fit well, but were a bit wide on the top of my foot, not fitted correctly.  I did love the way they looked though, and wish they worked for me."
Not a bad shirt. I did however cut out the red tank top because it was an odd fit underneath.
"This fashion jewelry is ok, heavy and much better than quality than others that say their jewelry is genuine sterling silver"
Doesn't have enough zip pockets.  When clasp is undone the entire insides fall out easily.  I'm in the market for something better.
"I usually wear size 6.  These shoes are 6.5 and are short and tight for my feet.  3 stars for quality and style but, too bad, I couldn't use them."
The fabric is very thin.  I needed a red t-shirt quickly and it was inexpensive.  I didn't expect much and I got what I paid for.
The mesh is very thin and see-through. i did not think it would with-stand the abuse of an active 7 year old. i returned it.
"I wear a women's size 8, and they are definitely on the upper limit for the socks. They stretch and show a lot of white through the picture when on. The length is just under my ankle bone, definitely not as high up as pictured."
they didn't stay in my kids shoes. My son lost all of his. i wouldn't but them again or recommend them .
little stretch...therefore too small.
"I normally wear a sz 8.5 and these have great stretch, but if you have long fingers, you still have to do that annoying little wiggle to get them to fit well. I gave them to my sister who has smaller hands and she loved them."
This model is a beautiful one but size is too far from real size. Waist size is very very large for the size i have requested.
"I got these for a costume. They are nothing fancy, but they will do the job"
"It was narrow, the color was matched with my cloths but it is not that kind of red that you can match with many cloth. In the front it is half circle it may looks fine in photos but in reality it is like doll shows.  I won't recommend unless you have an amazon promotion or you really need this specific color."
The size range is inaccurate.  My husband wears an 11 and these are way way too small.
So so. Great design but the quality of the fabric is not so good. Will last three months but I would not hope to pass it to future generations ;$
Had to use both pads to get a little contour.
"Very form fitting which was good, just not my style. The top was a little large for me even though I am a 38D. Nicely made, but returned it to find one that I like better."
Different than online
Great Product but runs small. Thanks!
"I was looking for dark brown low heeled boots to wear to work.  these are ok, but i would rather have them fit more snug at the ankle as i feel them move a little when i walk.  even thicker socks don't fill that gap.  if you have bigger ankles these will work great."
"Purchased this for my softball league. It matches our uniform colors perfectly. I like almost everything about this hat. Almost. The only thing I don't like is how TALL it is. I don't have a small head, but wearing this makes my head look small. It's almost like an exaggerated trucker hat. It feels like I'm wearing a 10 gallon hat. Sadly, I'm not exaggerating.

I'm going to try to throw this in the wash for several cycles and see if I can get it to collapse a bit. I'm open to any suggestions anyone may have. I'm not the type that likes looking like I'm smuggling a baby under my hat."
"My daughter loves pink and I liked that this backpack is highly visible. No one else has one in this eye-blinding pink color.

What I don't like is that one of the 2 main zippers repeatedly gets the fabric of the backpack edge stuck inside it. My husband has to fix it, it's difficult for even me to fix. This is some type of a design flaw, as the simple back and forth use of the zipper causes this to happen."
"SO comfortable and fit well, but this is like my third pair over the years because they get little holes quite easily."
"Fabric thinner than expected, but nice color of black.  I hope it washes well"
"Strap was broke from start , it fits and could be a cool hat but not able to wear it !"
The shoes seem well made but were smaller than expected.  The tongue is also a little short.  But they have worn well and take a beating.
The costume it's self isn't so bad. My son that I bought it for is 4 years old so the 3-4 fit perfectly.  The reason I only gave it 3 stars is that The mask however is NOT for a 3-4 year old. It's the eyes they are too far apart. The mask fits my 10year old son just fine. It's also fit me (an adult) just fine. So if they are going to sell this costume for small kids the they need to make a mask to fit the smaller kids as well.
nice but the thigh opening is too tight - i have very slender legs - to look nice under jeans or leggings
"look nice.
soft upper so no pain on top of foot when walking.
feel  is narrow in the toe box  :(  for me puts pressure on the 5th toe .
I have not decided whether to keep them or return"
Shoe is pretty but fits rather narrow.  I have a regular 7.5M foot but went up to an 8M and it still fits narrow. Gave shoes to my daughter who is 12...and they fit good enough for that age.
i love the look of the shoe. but after wearing for a little bit they started rubbing blisters on the top of my foot.  I have to wear a thick badaid under my sock to prevent blisters.
"I loved this, but the lining was loose and unless I sewed it it would have shown. Too bad because it was just what I wanted for my daughter's wedding"
So sad the calf was so small. Had to return
"Very cute flats, but the heel was either too large or too loose to stay on much."
"great for kitchen but expect blisters!!!!
I added an insole to mine to help lift my foot.
the rubber rubs in many areas "
I have not tried it on yet but the size small will fit perfectly. I am going to wear it for work though the material is not as office as I hope it would be. I also think it could be a bit less expensive yet it's a nice dress.
Just like it says small but good quality not a cheep design or print
I ended up returning them -wanted black and they weren't available so I settled for the blue and they are not as oractical
"The quality is ok, not sure how long the straps will last.  The problem is that its made for a childs arm.  My arms are pretty thin around the wrist, but I cant wear it."
Comfortable fit and nice shade of gray.  The fabric was lighter than I expected.
"This coat is well made BUT way too bulky, and sizing is off. 2XL felt more like 3XL if not larger. Hard to move around in it. And it is a heavy coat, so we're back to drawing board. Looking for down filled coat from now on. This one would be awesome if not made for HULK."
Nice boot but fit kind of weird and the upper chafed my calf.
"Larger and much heavier than I anticipated. I own a 44mm Panerai, so I'm familiar with a larger and heavier case, but at 50mm those extra 6mm make a significant difference.  The blue markings on the dial weren't quite as bright as they appear on the listing.  Seems nicely finished and it's a nice timepiece, it just wasn't the right thing for me once I had it on.  Returned and credited promptly."
"The watch itself seems very sporty.  The band was very comfortable to wear.  However, the dial was just too busy for me.  Also, the yellow button was not very intuitive to use.  I returned this and got myself the Fossil Men's AM4562."
show alot of chest
These are thin. They aren't double lined.
"I bought these as actual shirts for the Mommy wardrobe: yoga pants + t-shirt. I'm busty and 5-6 and this hits past my hips, nearly like a tunic (only clingy). My husband is 6-4 and super thin and this fits him well too. Ladies: you can wear a black bra with this (both black and blue), and it is not see-through!

Originally I gave this 4 stars, however, I have amended this after washing them for the first time. I washed the clothes in COLD water with Tidewater Cold detergent. The load was mostly black clothes and the blue shirt. No towels, t-shirts, underwear, socks. However, when removing the blue shirt from the washer, it now has lost a bit of it's brilliant blue color. Still blue, but it looks like I washed it 30 times, not once."
"This will serve the purpose I bought it for, however, persons with larger chests may not find this acceptable."
"It's not your fault, complete blame on me for ordering the wrong size, or not knowing how to put one of these things on."
"It looks nice and opens and closes cleanly (and is compact), but for all the claims about being ""windproof"", it isn't. It flipped right over at the first hint of wind. So if you just need something compact without much wind protection, this is fine. If you want something truly windproof, get a GustBuster instead."
"Come on, this lightsaber is huge.  My kids can't even wrap their hands around it.  It's hard to handle and use.  Why can't they make it a bit smaller so kids can grip it."
"The short ones ride up on the legs. I also have in regular length, which I like so much better."
"It fit as described, but there was too much bra for my friend's taste."
"I purchased these for my wife to help her circulation issues.  Though she liked the colors and style, the fit was not adequate for her needs.  This was no fault of the product, as she has robust leg  and foot musculature courtesy from years of kickboxing.  Though she liked the fit for her toes, they were extremely tight on her calves and left profound ""calf-dents"".

In short- for people who have stick-legs or are built like an anorexic Barbie with scrawny muscles, this may work perfectly.  For people with well-developed muscles looking to control edema, these may not be your best choice."
The fabric is rather clingy. I ordered a large and it's really not attractive across my stomach and hips. Perhaps ordering a size up would've been more attractive it just didn't do it for me.
I got the swimsuit very quickly. The color was very cute. The shorts fit me perfectly. But the top not so much. I am heavy up top and I wish the band at the bottom was a little bit wider for more support. That was the only issue that I had with the suit.
"Like it, its very cute but don't like how the seam comes up so high, right under the lacing. Even with my highest pair of high-waisted jeans, the seam lays above it and cuts across your entire body. Could be better but it's good for the price."
The clips snap more often than not. Not bad but not the best.
"The belt seems well made, I ordered my usual size and it seemed to run a bit small.  what the picture doesn't show are the riveted holes that are used for the belt increments.  I was somewhat disappointed because even though I did receive this at a discount I still paid more than I wanted to for taking a chance on this product.  I will make this work and will just have to lose a bit more weight and Im sure this will fit well.  Another issue I found is that the belt didn't slide smoothly through my pant loops, I might be nit picking but, I tend to remember when its a pain to use something."
I bought these to go with a specific top that was long. It's a good thing too because the pants barely cover my behind yet they are kind of baggy in the front. And no I don't have them on backward. I usually wear a US size 12/14. I will wear these with the top but I hope the wind doesn't blow it up so no one can see how uneven the pants fit up top.
"I love, love, love these shoes, but after wearing them one day they got a funny crease a little less than an inch from the edge of the point where my foot stops. I'm so disappointed because after one day of wearing them they look months old! I tried to shove some tissue into the toe to fix the crease but with the patent finish it's really obvious and the tissue makes them significantly less comfortable. A shame, because they are so perfect to wear with everything in my wardrobe! Now they just have to be night out/casual shoes, though I was hoping to wear them for work. Maybe it's how I walk, but to my knowledge, I don't have a way of walking that's much different than anyone else. Also, the description says they are patent leather, but they are synthetic. They still look nice, but if you want leather, these are not."
Not good for being on feet for long periods of time.  Cute shoe though
Awesome quality! I would size up for more play and comfort next time!
I really liked this wrap when I first received it. I wore it as much as possible and it became streched out and difficult to wear after about a month. It works but once it became streched out it wasn't comfortable anymore.
"They are very stiff pants, but fit well on a slim build with smaller legs."
"I'm about a 38D, and ordered the pink X-Large, which fits nicely. I like the bright color, that it dries quickly and seems to soak up sweat. It doesn't stink afterward - I'll often wear it a 2-3 times during intense workouts before washing it. Unaboob is less a problem with this bra than with others, so that's nice too. I really like this for the way it stays tight to me, but I have issues with the straps. The strap fabric is shiny and silky. After every wash I have to readjust the straps. The bigger problem is that when I have them adjusted correctly, they loosen when I'm working out. It's especially bad with the first thing we do for many kickboxing classes: jumping rope. Good thing it's tight, or I might not like it as well."
"I ordered this cami in white. The cami I received came in a clear plastic bag, clearly labeled ""white"" on the bag, but the cami in the clear bag was a deep wine color, easily obvious to anyone looking at the bag. I didn't want the bother of trying to exchange for the correct color though. It is a pretty color, so I just kept it."
I returned this item. Very water proof but to much like wearing plastic for me.
"This was very cute, i bought it to use the garter to hold up a kinda slouchy pair of thigh high boots. i would have given this 5 stars, but the piece that you hook the garter to on the back of the skirt broke the very first night i wore it! i just pulled the strap off the other side and the front straps held the boots up the rest of the night, but still not the greatest quality. Maybe would have held up better with just stockings, but the boots were pretty thin and light so not sure it would have really made a difference."
"I'm in between sizes.  I first ordered a medium which were too tight to wear but I could still get them on. I did this based on other reviews that these stretch out A LOT.  So I got the large and they fit without being tight. They looked ok until I wore them all day and slept in them.  The back and waist stretched at least 2-3 inches and looked like a potato sack.  I'm going to try again with the size medium and see if once they stretch out they fit correctly.

Other that the fit issues, I think the very concept of them is ingenious and they do look just like jeans."
"These earrings showed up on time there was no damage. but I want to start off by saying these are not your typical earrings. Looks are deceiving by all means. The earrings are square maybe rectangle shape  not your  typical round tip that you would Have on ear rings. At first when I noticed the unusual shape I didn't think anything of it into  began to insert the earring in my ear.  Now your typical earing is a lot smaller and round tip Then this is square rectangle shape that begin to quickly stretch out my ear hole.  I thought it wasn't so bad I figured my ear would get used to it.  Then the earring wouldn't clamp in the back it's not the typical ear ring where it  clamps easily on. Of course!  Nooo, this is the kind of ear ring that where you have to separated the ear ring and insert it in the little hole and it became extremely painful since my ear hole was not used to being open so wide.  I do wear the earrings for a couple hours and my ears hurt for two whole days afterwards.  My personal opinion only because I think my  your holes are not used to being spread  that why if you have wide your holes these hearings are perfect for you.  So warning'warning must have  wide earring holes for these kind of earrings otherwise that you're going to hurt for at least a while into your ears get used to them."
"I ordered it in cobalt color, it wasn't as bright as pictured.  Quality was also not as good, thread was hanging in one place and it felt like ripping apart when I tried to put these leggings on.  I ordered it because I have Lysse Leggings Denim Control Capri 1615 and Lysse Leggings for Women-The New Cotton Skinny Legging (Style #1202) that I like and I was looking for the same in another color.  These are not the same quality, or maybe I got an imitation.... There was no issue with returning through Amazon though."
"The designs are fun, but man, I hate the little Tommy Hilfiger logo on them.  The colors of the logo are so jarring with the colors of the socks.  Oh well.  Nobody ever sees the logo but me, but it drives me crazy everytime I look at them."
Nice quality but very thin socks and in heavy snow boots tend not to hold up too well - often shift to bottom of foot when running in boots.
"these are okay, but i just realized that they are a half a size too big.  i checked the amazon order and ordered the 7.5, but received 8s.  bummed.  these are terrible, but don't support the arch in the right place."
Thought it would be a little larger in the mid section. Not bad. I do like the style and I did wear it twice so far.
"These are great, the material is comfortable, and everything would be perfect, except for one ""tiny"" detail... Did you ever put on a pair of hose that was all kind of crooked and you had to remove, adjust and re-wear them? Well, that is more of less the case here, except you don't get to fix them by taking them off and putting them on again because... these leggings were sewn backwards!!! Yes, meaning that the back is sewn in front and viceversa.  The bandages still are in the front, but the waistband goes very high (almost to the ribcage) in front and so low in the back, that it is ridiculous.  The front is slightly roomier -the area that would accommodate your buttocks in a perfect pair of leggings, while in the back you run the risk of showing the beginning of your derriere -to say it nicely- and they tend to go up in between the cheeks in a way that is kind of (sorry) a reverse camel toe!!! They are still wearable, but not very comfortable due to the explained issue which makes them tight in the back and loose in front,  and of course, I can only wear them with something on top, but never just as leggings.  I wanted them for working out, so that is out of the question now.
I do think they were wrongly put together, and that is a pity because I really like them!  Unfortunately, I missed my returning window because I was traveling.
By the way, the sizing is good.  Just for reference, I am about 5' 4"" and weigh 111 pounds."
"I didn't pay attention to the size of these pendants and just assumed they would be ""normal"" size.  These are quite large for wearing around your neck, at least for me.  I have the OM pendant hanging from my mirror in my car and it looks fantastic!!  I'm sure I'll find other places to hang the other two. They are very shiny and colors are vibrant."
These fit as expected but they are not soft. They are a rough material.
"I like the style of the shoe, they were to big."
"It took a very long time to ship but the shipping was free so I cant complain. The item is WAY smaller than pictured. I'm including a picture with myself in about the same pose for comparison. Overall though, a good quality for the price. I've gone to a few classes and nothing has broken."
"I love my The One2 Altra shoes, in like and almost unholy way.  So I figured I'd try their trail shoes.  They're okay enough to use occasionally and not bother returning.  But they are heavy, clunky, and not flexible.  Plus, they cause my feet to tingle and fall asleep if I wear them too long, especially while biking.  They slip a bit on trails, more so than my trail roc shoes (Inov8), so the tread isn't so great either.  If I wasn't so lazy, I probably would return them, now that I actually write this out.  But I am hopeful that they will break in eventually.  Not what I was hoping for from a minimal shoe."
"Its okay, nothing special, but okay"
"The bathing suit was ok. The color and the style were nice but the fringes looked unfinished like someone just cut them with a scissor. Because of that it looked cheap. For the amount of money it is, it should be better quality. I gave a few stars because the return went smooth and the seller was very good. I will definitely buy more from this seller."
"Way too big.  Very nice color, though.  Pretty."
A little large in the waist area.
It's great for the price but I wish the bar wasn't sooo long.. kind of makes it look sloppy and as if my belly button wasn't pierced right. I am just using these for when I'm not planning on showing my tummy though.
"This boot runs a little big , had to return a size 12 for and 11.5. Light weight and comfortable. Giving these boots a 3 star because they are advertised as waterproof and even have :waterproof "" embossed on the outside of the boot. However they are not waterproof or water resistant. Rode my motorcycle in a misty rain for about 20 minutes wearing a rain suit , everything dry except my feet. When I got home my socks were soaked and so was the inside of the boots. How Columbia can say these are waterproof is beyond me."
"These came in a box labelled U.S. 8.5, U.K. 6.  This is wrong!  A UK 6 is a US size 8, and when I called Clarks directly about it, the woman on the  phone agreed that it was an error.  I reordered, and the 9 is a better fit, if a bit narrow.  But now I wonder if all Clarks are sized this way..."
Bought this bag for my parents when they had to travel to Africa. It was big enough for their stuff and so far it's handling well.
"The purse is of a great style; however, the quality of construction is very poor.  The stitching was bad--loose threads, double stitching in places, and the zipper in one pocket was not sewn in at all."
"It is pretty,  light weight and I love the color,  but it runs too big."
"the bridge of the tongue, which presses against one's shin is fairly hard leather and chafes a bit. Teh workman ship is superb, although the fit is smaller than i expected."
It's a little smaller espevilly the shoulder.
"Like other reviewers have mentioned, in the 2 pack the two shorts are different sizes, despite buying them as a pair and one size. I bought the dark blue and black. The blue fits great, but the black is too tight. I plan on keeping them because the black one might motivate me to lose some weight, but for anyone whose weight doesn't fluctuate, beware."
"It's more of a sundress than a bathing suit cover up but it's still cute. I am with everyone else that think's the slip underneath should be longer, it's way too short."
"but... if you are a teen and need some claire's quality different colored faux pearls - go for it!
otherwise let this one slide...."
"The Wolverine men's black leather belt appears to be made from some sort of manufactured leather.  The back side of the belt uses a soft suede material, and the outer side is some sort of veneer.  I cannot tell what the material in the center is, whether its a composite leather material or actual leather,

Since I wear 31 waist jeans and belts are sold in even inches, I ordered a size up.  I learned to buy belts this way years ago, and when I do, I always get a well-fitting belt that looks good.  This Wolverine black leather belt is no exception, it easily fits in the loops and has a good overlap.

After about three weeks of daily use, the suede material on the back of the belt is starting to peel away at the edges, and the leather veneer is starting to scrape away.  The belt is definitely showing signs of wear, much more than the simple leather belts I normally purchase from the local leather clothing/fetish store.

The Wolverine men's black leather belt, sent to me in exchange for an honest review, looks good and is currently sold at a reasonable price.  If you're looking for a simple black leather belt for short term use, the Wolverine men's black leather belt may work well.

PROS:
Nice inexpensive leather belt
Fits well based on purchased size

CONS:
Not built to last"
"I ordered an 11. That size is usually tight on me, but perfect for skinny jeans which is what I was going for here. I'm 5'8 140, small waist, wide hips. These fit TIGHT in the waist, with a higher rise than anticipated (nearly to bra line). They're loose in the hips all the way down to the knees and tight again on the calves and ankles. I won't wear 'em much. Just when everything else is dirty. 3 stars because the black acid wash is just like the picture. Bummed they look like MC hammer/genie pants though."
"I purchased this to wear as part of my matador costume for Halloween, as I needed a fitted shirt with ruffles (preferably).  I went according to the size chart, being that I'm a 34DDD, I selected size XXL which equates to size 10.  I found the fit to be large overall in the trunk, and the sleeves were too short for me.  For reference, I'm 5'9"", 145lb.  I would re-order in a smaller size, but the sleeve length would still be an issue.
It's not a horrible shirt, just not for me."
"Not sure what I expected, but the top would not stay up - it would roll down ... I am not that portly so I was somewhat disappointed."
"These earrings were bigger than I'd anticipated, but very pretty. Unfortunately  after I wore 3 times one came apart. I will try glueing it back together. I would have given 5 stars if not for that."
a little tight in the butt area but the length is just right.
"These are plastic/rubbery looking shoes. I think they are more like Payless material but it does say synthetic so they are being upfront about it. I think they are simple and attractive, but I felt they might break or come apart quickly. The heel is pretty high so that worried me that I may not be properly supported."
"It's beautiful and Ilove the material, but it runs way too small.. I had to gift it to my little cousin"
I thought that they would have better bottoms on them. Overall soft and keeps your feet warm. Throw in the wash and clean. Was expecting at least a flat bottom/
"and inexpensive. Not good for slippery surfaces, but does provide some coverage against water/liquids; air holes in the sides of the shoes allow water/moisture in. I did have to purchase arch supportive shoe inserts. Overall, a decent shoe depending on the need."
These were way too big for me. I'm a size ten and they were too long and awkward looking. I will be returning these because I find them really ugly and too big.
They are super cute but no very comfortable.  They are very stiff and heavy feeling.  When I walk my heel feels like it is slipping out.  I think that is bc they are a wide fit. This is the 3rd brand I have tried.  I kept them so I would have something for summer but my boots that are another brand are sooo much more comfortable.
"I read the other reviews so I expected this costume to be crappy. It is, but I wouldn't be able to fabricate one myself.  The hat is especially bad. I will need to reinforce it with cardboard in order for it to actually stay in place. It's also a huge outfit...will need to pin it to make it fit hubby."
"Little to ""mom jeans"" for me.  I hardly ever wear them.  Mostly when I know I'm going to be around the house."
They are ok...A little big...My biggest complaint Is the back pockets. They are huge making my butt look huge. Hate Levi pockets.
"As much as I LOVE aerosoles shoes, this style is disappointing.
It is made of the usual quality materials and cushioned nicely.
But the shoe has an inwardly curved last, that basically means it fits best if you are pidgeon-toed.
Now that I look again at the images, you can see it, but if it had been placed vertically it would have been more obvious.
Put this one down to experience I guess.
Sigh."
"Small in the arms, fit ok everywhere else."
"meh just some sweat pants, these are not what I would consider lounge sleep pants AKA PJ's."
So much dye used in this top it gave me a rash. After soaking the excess dye out it's a flattering tunic. I call it a tunic because I'm short & it's long enough for me to wear just with leggings and boots.
"It was ok, just received the jacket and not the pants.  So I had to return it."
"Was a little smaller than I expected, but has a good color and texture."
"I bought the size i allways use but these are very narrow. Not confortable at all.
Nice looking with painfull wearing."
Felt much like a very supportive flip-flop.  Less like a sandal.
"Bought the red in a 2x (normally wear 18/20)-  though it is nicely made and a lovely shade, the shirt runs small - hugs close to the body, so I won't be wearing it without a cover up and because of the size, it's tight around the hips, so the cool 'flowy' reason I bought it doesn't apply - not meant for a plus sized hourglass shape"
It was too small even though its the same size and style Ive been wearing. I returned it.
"Very nice, but the material it's something poor"
"The pendant is perfect, however the chain is another matter. THIS DEFINITELY IS NOT STAINLESS STEEL!!!  I'm posting a picture of the necklace and pendant to show you exactly what I'm talking about. As you can see, the chain is no longer has the ""stainless steel"" on a good portion of it. Now it looks like I need to order a decent stainless steel chain for the the pendant. Not too happy with having to do this :-(

I gave 5 stars in my previous rating, but now that has dropped to 3 stars. The 3 stars is for the pendant only. The chain is -0 stars."
The bulbs get hot fast. The lead wires that go from the battery to the bulbs are kind of short so if you are trying to hide the battery on something larger than this skull in the photo you may be quite limited. I was trying to illuminate the skull of a bear and ended up needing to tape the battery to the top of his head simply because the wires were so short.
"Variable quality. I bought two brown ones, hoping for a matched set. One is fairly nice, as pictured, with thick, soft material and a nice rich color. The other is made from thinner, stiffer material with a dark matte brown finish. and a slightly different strap arrangement. Still works, as at least they're both brown, but it's a bit of a shame."
"It wasn't for me, I didn't like the fabric and it was to long in the sleeves and body for me. I am short so it just might of been that, Did get it fast but I sent it back with no problem."
"The quality on these packing cubes are not as good as the other ones I bought. The material seems thinner and the zippers sometimes separate. The color (polka dot navy blue) looks nice and matched my son's luggage, so we decided to keep it. The handles on the three mesh bags was a nice addition since you're able to carry them."
"Great looking and great quality, but fits way small. Especially in sleeve length, but I just keep them up and it's not a problem."
"Moving Comfort makes great bras and this comes in second to my Fiona sports bras. It's very comfortable once it's on, but I find it difficult to take on and off over my head."
I had this for about 4 months and the silver completely  wore off.
needed a siz3 12 instead of a 10 for a 144pd weight
"well, three stars only. i liked the design of the shoes, so i ordered them. this is looks like a good shoe that you could wear to a birthday party or similar sort. but not a comfortable shoe for everyday use or long hours. the edges of the shoe felt they were somewhat too sharp so bit uncomfortable. its ok for the price. and after attending the party its going back into my closet until i go to another party. lots of people complained about the smell. which is true. it has a very strong petroleum odor that may be too strong for some people. they shipped it on time and arrived on time. so i had like five days before the party so i let the smell subside. left it under the sun for half a day and that seemed to take away about 70% of the smell. Instead of paying few hundred for a shoe, this was ok, so not going to bother about the smell too much. Ferro Aldo shoes' design looked impressive thats the reason i bought these. I may buy another Ferro aldo shoe, but if they still smell and feel the same then I'd quit buying this ."
"Good price, but thin on the top.  Also a bit heavy from the length.  Good for Halloween costume."
"After 1 week of wearing, I am able to offer my review.  I am a healthy 50 years old who works on tiled floor.  Lots of walking during my shift.  I wear typical men's dress socks, not athletic or hiking socks at work.  I need a non-mesh sneaker-like shoe to wear at work.  This shoe looks nice and has the solid upper construction that I need.  Unfortunately, it is a 1/2 size longer than all of my other sneakers & dress shoes.  The width is average.  I would give more stars for this shoe if it was sized better.  I was in too much of a bind & didn't have time to exchange this shoe for the next smaller size."
"My foot is too narrow for this shoe and it looks large on my foot, but again like how Chaco's give arch support."
"love the post and backing, but the gemstone is dull and gray looking- no shine.  Tip:  use a safety pin or bobby pi to remove from packaging.  Sharp enough to reopen slightly closed piercings if desired- made to use in a piercing gun."
"They are amazing shoes, but they run incredibly small. For instance, I'm a size 10, but according to Jessica Simpson, I should be a size 11.5. Beautiful but small in person."
"Good shoes,  but they run way to big. Choose at least half size smaller"
"The shoe was very comfortable. It was a little longer than I expected, but not enough that you would want to size down. There wasn't a ton of arch support, but I could wear them all day and be comfortable. I didn't return them for being uncomfortable. The reason I returned them is that the toe area looked dirty. I liked the bright color of the green flats, and I think it was supposed to look ""aged"" but it just looked dirty, and I could imagine that the rest of the shoe would look like that after a few wears."
"fits tight, however a real good deal and shoe..."
"Too large , but good quality"
Fits but top rolls
A chemical smell when I open up the package.
Mommy jeans.
"Ordered a size up due to other reviews, overall size still a little on the small size... this was extremely tight in the arm area especially near the elbows... My husband has done muscle but he's not hulk. Shirt made decent, material is ok as well. This was made more for women's arms"
They are slim fitting and have an adjustable waist. My son is tall and thin and it's hard to find pants that fit. He complains that they are stiff. After 4 washes they are still pretty stiff.
I found this item to be somewhat large. I was able to pin it and make it work for the occasion.
not true to size! I ordered a sz 13 and was much smaller than sz 13 timberland adventure seeker sandal
"Based on other reviews, I am shocked to say that this top is way too big for me. Other customers listed their stats, I am taller, bustier, weigh more and simply overall a bigger person and while they found the top perfectly sized or even too small, this top is clearly too big on me, sliding it into frumpy. I purchased 2 other tops at the same time, while all 3 would likely have suited me better in a size L instead of an XL, the other 2 look good and as they may shrink, I decided to keep them in the XL. This one I'm sending back and in future I will purchase a size L as my default size in the brand.
I am 5'10, 47-35-42, due to my bust (and belly) I am usually always a size XL or larger in tops. The largest size noted for this top is 42 in the bust so I even wondered if the XL would be too small. Not a chance. I'd likely end up a M in this top but I'm not going to take a chance. I ordered the light brown, the color was a bit darker than I expected but not unpleasant."
"first pair was the wave...I wear them ALL the time, won't wear anything else...these are MUCH more stylish BUT the arch is not as profound as in the wave and I need more support.  Heel cup doesn't seem to be as deep either, love the style but I need more support."
it's nice for a good cold day...half beanie...half hat. it was way too big for my little head though...so my husband got a new hat :D
I was excited to get the bag however when you walk the zippers clink against eachother and it drove me crazy. Returned.
"It fits, but it's pretty dang short (I'm 63)...I'm 5' 61/2"" and weigh around 152 (gained a ""pooch"" this past year). I ordered a M/L and expected the length to be a bit longer. A younger woman could certainly wear it with no problems!"
This shirt is a size to small.
"I can never decide whether to order a S or an M.  M's fit me in alot of items because I don't like 'skimpy'; but this M was miles too large so I gave it to a friend.  Should've returned and exchanged for a Small but it seemed more trouble that it was worth.  I can't attest to its quality, etc. since I never wore it but it seemed to be nice.  Just remember, it runs large!"
"Haven't worn yet. A little small. Im pretty white, but even for me the underneath color is really pale beigh."
"My daughter is a petite 3 year old, she still wears 2T and I could have bought her the 4T and it would have fit exact. My one year old can wear these now. The color of the tanks is also not correct; the purple is not a lavender color it's a dark purple. The pink is not a light pink, it's a hot pink."
"I sent these back. They are decent, but the ankle is a little stiff and small. The Henry Farrera option was a better style in my opinion."
"Returned. Really liked the overall look, but too small, or the opening needed to be on the long side rather than the shorter side.
Looks great. Looks like it would last forever, just too small for me. Personally I think all purse/bag makers should put a light inner liner. I must be getting old, but I feel like a need a flashlight to look inside the purse. A white or silver liner would have really helped."
"For reference Im 6 tall, about 160 lbs, and 38D bust with an athletic build. I normally wear a medium or large depending on the product. I ordered a M and it was massive.

I really wanted to like the shirt but it was definitely a casual fit/ loose type of deal. Unfortunately that does not look good on my body type. Im not sure if ordering a small would have fit my bust, So Ill be returning it.

The positives: loved the color and pattern, the shirt was fairly soft, and long.

Photos show it a free and flowy and then me holding it how Id like it to fit/ all the excess fabric."
I haven't worn these and I have had them for a couple of months.  I was disappointed with the durability of the strap.  I know it won't hold up to alot of wear so I will save them for special occasions.  The shoes are beautiful but I would have liked the strap to be more durable.
"Looks great, feels great, arms are TOO SHORT! This shirt was big enough in every other way, and would have looked better on a shorter, rounder person."
The length is really long....
"Nothing special, middle of the road."
"I absolutely love this watch. Its beautiful, good weight, good background designs but the battery sucks!!!! Its seriously so bad. Like maybe 8 hours without using it except to check the time, and Im not exaggerating."
A little too burgundy for me. The sizing was also a little large. I would of had to go down a half size to get a better fit.
Not original
"This dress runs super small and the material looks way different in person.  I ordered an XL based on the size chart and knowing the dress is in Asian sizing.  I would only recommend this dress if you are petite and short.  Otherwise it looks cute from afar and there are no lose threads.  This dress is just okay and would be best in a beach/casual setting.  The material feels silky but, in a cheap way.  I really love the other dresses this seller has but, this one just didn't cut it for me.

Sample provided for testing and review."
"The bottom is slick....no grips what so ever. Undecided on keeping or see if I can't put some anti slip on bottoms. Otherwise love the shoe!! Fits well, very cute, unusual color. Strap is rather short, almost like it's backwards...."
"Waist is too high, and it's tight in the bust. I wish it came in XL  so mabye it would fit in the bust area. If you are a 38C or bigger I would not recommend. Otherwise it's a good length and the color scheme is cute."
"The bead is beautiful.  The cord is cheap. If you have a chain to put it in, looks nice.  Not sure if the bead alone could be brought for less price."
"I was hoping that the shoes would be navy or at least a deep blue, based on the picture. They were not. They are more like a dusty blue colour - nothing like the picture.

For $29 I'm going to keep them as they are very well made, well-cushioned and elegant. I would also recommend going down half a size as the toe area is quite roomy and I will definitely need an insole or heel grips to fit them correctly."
"a little tight,beautiful shoe"
these are really cute... preppy... but the string on the shorts ripped out the first time I tied it... it must not have been sewn in very tightly or at all.  Plus the shorts are really high waisted ... they fit just below my bustline... I like a more low hanging short especially for sleepwear
"It was my fault for ordering a size too large, but it seems kind of cheaply made. It would work for a night out but I am not sure how long this would last."
Fit as expected just didn't look as cute in person as it does in the picture.  Thought material was too stiff.
"I usually wear size small US, I ordered size medium and it fits me perfectly. However the material is little cheap. It wrinkle so much so I returned it."
These boots are great but a year later my son is busting through the side. There's a huge split. I expect wear and tear but this wasn't something I expected.
I'm between sizes 6 and 8 so I bought a size 8. The fit was a little big around the waist. Sturdy material. The exposed zipper on the back is a great touch on an otherwise simple garment.
It's okay. The design and color is as expected. The material is different but works well to keep cool.
"still debating if I should return these boots.  They look nice but are not that comfortable. I've worn Dansko shoes for a long time and they are always comfortable right out of the box; these are not!  I have somewhat narrow feet and I ordered by ""normal"" Dansko size and they feel too tight.  I have a few days to think about the shoes before I decide to keep or return.  Great price for a typically great shoe."
"I purchased this product for a dress that i have that is ope in the middle, the front clip of the bra is noticeable but not much. This bra is great for strapless dresses or front slits like my shirt. i would really recommend it"
"Not quite as pictured, undersized and short"
"much, much thinner then expected. so much so that they feel like nylon tights, not like cotton. i'm too lazy to send them back for a refund."
This didn't fit my size 18/20 frame. So I had to return it. The material was great.
"Really, cute.  Runs a bit big.  Sheds a lot."
"I wanted a watch with the date and day dials. The dials on this watch are FAKE. I purchased this watch through a lightening deal so, I didn't pay that much for it. The watch itself is very nice looking. The fake dials make it appear cheap. I'm giving it 3 stars because it is cute, it came in a nice box, I got it at a steal, and it was on my doorstep in 2 days. If I had payed more, I would definitely send it back."
didn't fit well and made me look like an elderly woman
"I'm 5'3"", 110 lbs, 36-26-37. It isn't as long on me as on the model chick, but still pretty cute and cozy. I'd've preferred it mimicked the model's fit more. I wish it were just a tad larger. Still sporting it and feeling cute. Just know that it's made for petites and cartoon characters."
"Runs really really short. I usually wear a 9.5 so bought a 10 and they were really short in bare feet so no way socks would even fit. Had to return them because I'm sure I would swim in the size 11. Too bad, they are very comfortable and have decent support so I think you would be able to walk all day in them."
"Lost my wallet, and needed to buy something quickly.  This will do for a while, I guess.  Seems to be sturdily constructed, but has many design features I dislike.  Too heavy.  Has weird thing that flips out to reveal several pouches, but doesn't fasten shut (what would you keep there that wouldn't easily fall out. There a chain with a ring for keys that's INSIDE the zipper for coins, which must have been the result of a contest to come up with the stupidest design element possible.  Also has many slots for credit cards, which I don't keep in my wallet (a very lucky decision when I lost it).

 Was influenced by the long-existing Buxton brand in making this purchase.  Won't make that mistake again.  Will replace this as soon as I find something I really like."
They work for me as easy to slip on without lacing garden shoes.  I wish they had a little more padding.
Runs a tad small but is very pretty.
they felt kind of cheap. and very shiny.
"The size and fit are according to description. I would have preffered that the white shirt be separate so my son could tuck it in his pants. Since it is sewn to the red velvety vest looking garment, you either tuck in the entire thing or nothing. Three buttons fell of the first day he wore it. The cape was the best part. Long enough and was nice looking. Considering the cost, it does the job. Will probably be used only once."
"Nice bra , although it is scratchy"
"I thought this shirt looked pretty cool from the main photo - but the neck is much larger than the main image.

I think the collar is supposed to be a little higher up."
"I was Ok with the purse, but it looked cheap. It was bigger than I expected, but I kept it so I could use it to put work papers in."
Heavy and pretty but too big.
"Too long and the bust was really tight, I had high hopes but it just didn't work for me"
These boots are very comfortable. Run a full size small.  Spent the week in the Wisconsin woods deer hunting with absolutely no blisters. Down side is for me they were only warm enough when the temperature was above 35. My feet got cold when I was just standing for long periods. I had liners and heavy wool socks on as well.
I wear a 7.5m and got a 8.5w and they wasn't  wide at all
"Toeless pantyhoes are hard to find, and so although I don't love these, I'm glad to be able to get something in the way of toeless hoes, so I gave them 3 stars.  I'm 5-5 125 lb and ordered the AB size.  They have like tight bands around the top of my thighs and ride up my butt, which drives me crazy, but I discovered that a size CD is somewhat more comfortable. Admittedly, my thighs and hips are not skinny. The other thing I found disappointing is that they run so easily.  My idea of a 5 star product would be high -waisted to eliminate muffin top, more durable, and without that banding that rides up.  I normally pay about $25 for good quality high-top pantyhose, and they are actually cheaper over time, because they last.  Would that I didn't have spider veins and whiteness so I wouldn't have to wear them at all.  But not in this life."
Fits well. We thought that it would be higher on the waist.
"My son absolutely loves his new super hero shirts, but he will only be able to wear them for a short time as he will grow out of them quickly due to them being not true to size."
"I wear XXL, for XXL this is a little tight, but overall good quality."
It looked very unflattering. I am not sure if it was the color combo (black and brown) or what but I'll be sending it back.
"it is a nice bracelet a cute gift for someone.my problem is I only got to wear it once.& it broke I had it on & took my dog for a walk.& when I got home that's when my son said hey your heart is missing from your bracelet.so well
that was a waste of money. I have many of bracelet's & none of them came apart like that. I feel that I am owed a replacement .thank you."
the back posts were much too long they actually hit neck and they tarnished quickly but cute design
"It definitely does not look like a Longchamp.  The leather is obviously faux, but  you get what you pay for.  Functional!"
"Good looking watch, but it came with a dead battery. It cost me $16 for a new one before I could even wear it. Pretty crappy"
Do not fix well.
Very comfortable for a safety shoe But a bit pricey
"Keep in mind that this is not an official US Army licensed product. I knew that beforehand, but ordered it because I could customize it.  With that being said, the embroidered Army logo is not as sharp and crisp as what you would find on the official licensed shirts.  As far as customizing, its okay but could only be customized on the left side below the logo and not on the right side.  The shirt material is okay but is not made from a thick material like what you would expect from most polo shirts. For how many washes can this shirt endure is unknown.  Would I place another shirt order? No."
"These are a lot bigger and a LOT longer than the ""no show trunk"" name suggests. They also stretch out really fast. Not my favorite."
I should had ordered my regular size. It is true to size.
You would think Madden (and I've met the man) would demand better quality. Insides started comming out after second wearing. If you but these order some contact cement. You'll need it
"We have to separate the jacket from the customer service. The jacket is all they said it would be. I like it. However, I was SHOCKED at SCOTTeVest's CEO's social media post. He called conservatives who bought ScotteVests ""f...ing conservative...idiots.""  I was now embarrassed and angry and didn't want to wear the jacket that I paid $174.00 for.

I called customer service yesterday (Feb. 6) and the customer service lady apologized for their CEO ""who was not longer with us"" and quickly attempted to rush me off the phone. I said, ""wait, wait...why are you rushing me off the phone?"" and she started yelling at me (yes, the call WAS recorded for 'customer service improvement') and when I tried to talk to her further, SHE HUNG UP ON ME.  This morning I attempted to ""chat"" online line with their ""vest expert"". She apologized for their ""no longer there CEO"" and then suggested that I should talk to that CEO. She proceeded to give me his email address (Scott@scottevest.com) showing that he is still at the company - or why would he have that email address?  I asked that the present CEO needs to write to every customer who purchased a jacket or vest who was offended. However, now I am supposed to write to their ""no longer there"" CEO. Sense my frustration? I now have an expensive jacket that reminds me of a very rude and ineffective CEO and customer service."
Not true to size I ordered a size 10 but it fits like a size 9
Great price and looks very nice. But the quality of the material is not soo good and hurt a little bit the back of my feet.
"The headdress looks fantastic. Received many compliments on it. However, it doesn't seem to be holding up very well. The glue is coming apart in places. Great for a party or two, but may need to retire after that."
"The Best Shirt (male XXL) was printed way too far to the side, not near the front as shown. The Buds shirt (Female XL) was far too small. Maybe XL for a child, not an adult female. Not a good purchase."
The photos looks better then the product recieved. It is somewhat small and the color is different. It will do fine for Halloween.
"Snagged easily and ran a little small. Other than that, these were for a one time use."
Too narrow and restricting.  Even when laced as loose as possible.  They're wear-able and that's why I didn't return them but I probably won't buy them again.  I love the Nike Flex series and will probably stick with those.
"Toe area fits as expected, the heel area slips. I will have to put another insole in to wear them comfortably. Par for the course."
"These shoes look exactly as they look in the picture. I had to return it, however, because when I tried it on with a maxi dress the back bow got in the way. The hem of the dress would ride on it. Great quality though."
"The bracelet is beautiful, I have purchased this for my 13 year old granddaughter. Perfect sizing for her slender wrist."
"It's fine, sort of see-through, but ok."
Purchased several short/skirt sets like these for my Granddaughter who's an average 3 year old. Unfortunately after the second time it was laundered the skort was entirely to tight and the shirt was snug. I wash in cold water and dry all of her clothes on low heat. Really a shame because it's really a cute set
"I have owned a pair of these in the past that I had for about 8 years before my heel wore completely through the bottom. I LOVE these shoes.. but when I purchase the same size as my old pair this new pair stretched and flattened out until they are almost a size too big for me. I'm disappointed that they look so big and goofy, but they are still really comfy."
"Nice ring. I ordered it as a promise ring for my boyfriend, but it only fit the ring finger on his right hand, not his left hand & I told him that won't work for being a couple"
Fit ok but way more brown than olive so could not use for outfit intended
"At first I ordered a 7.5 based on other reviews. I am normally a size 7 and the 7.5s were too big. I then ordered a 7 and they fit perfectly although they had a bent zipper. I contacted the seller about the zipper about a week ago and am still jumping through hoops with the seller to get them returned. Love the shoes, but the seller is making it very difficult to return the defective pair."
Cool fit nice however my son broke them the first day within 2min or less of getting ahold of them
"Sturdy and cute but my colors were TOTALLY different from the pictures. The only purple part is in the center of the flower. The rest of my necklace is pink, white and green."
"As far as the jeans themselves go they are typical Levi quality. However the ""Sail"" model has button down flaps that cover the back pockets that make them unusable in my opinion."
The pieces all feel like they're different sizes
"this bracelet is very sparkly lightweight and pretty.  it is real gold !! but you have to be careful not to break it, it is delicate.  I like it over my shirtsleeve."
somewhat small but is  stretchable. pretty
"I ordered a 36""  but it measures 35"" . Nice thought. I like it"
"Doesn't fit well on bigger bodied men, if you are one, go another size up.  I generally wear size 36, ran too tight around my butt."
"It is nice jacket and nice color, the fabric is not soft but it is ok for spring to be around the house or to gout out informal."
Boobs come out of the back top etc. not very good.
I think that these earrings are ugly. Ugh!
Looks nice until you get close.  The lining is only what you see in the picture; it is not fully lined and the fabric is very thin.
"It wasn't what I expected because the hood was big and bulky and I could see the color of whatever I wore underneath the fleece, as it was lightweight.  I will keep looking..."
"the colour doesn't look as in the picture is pink.....the size is okay. anyone needs a pink bag, have a consideration on this product."
"I like this shoe a lot but the only reason I gave it a 3 star and not more was because my ankles are a little bit larger than most people's so the strap is a little snug where you clasp it. There isn't a great arch support so sometimes my feet feel a little sore if I wear them all day and am standing for extended periods of time.

Besides that the shoe is soooo cute! I love the sparkles. I wear these to work and for formal events. I would recommend to anyone who wants to have a flashy sandal :)"
Sleeves have no stretch at all and are pretty small.
"Love the shoe, but its smaller than excepted"
Great quality shoe but the M+ is just to narrow. I normally wear medium width in U.S sizes. Previous to these I ordered medium and returned. Reordered M+ hoping for better fit (no luck) to narrow through mid foot.
"The shirt is cute, and comfy. I subtracted two stars because the cut is a little small, and the fabric is pretty thin. Go up one size for a snugger fit, and maybe two for a loose fit. At $3, a solid buy."
Lining comes out of the bra in washer. They are okay.
"I ordered an XL based on some other reviews, and do wear between a L and XL, however, it is much longer and wider than expected.  The fabric is nice and soft, so I do like that."
"They were too small, I already returned these?"
Beautiful but clunky. Makes a better pendant. I made 2 necklaces to give as gifts and saved money in doing so.
cute dress but is not loose like i expected
"Love hounds, but the size chart for these are incorrect they were to small. I gave them to a family member."
I doubt the waistband will hold up for long. Very flimsy.  Not really a bikini type. Would look better over a depends.
I wear a size 7 5/8 hat and this hat is a little tight. The face protection is also a little tight. This tightness causes the cloth to go in my mouth a little when I open my mouth. Not very comfortable when I have to pull or spit it out of my mouth.
"Material is way shiny and not very regal looking. I am 5'10"" and the skirt reached the floor even with my 4"" heels."
They run a bit small so they slip off my heal. I wear a 7/7.5
Thought it was larger than it is.
"I wear XL usually. I'm 6 foot and weigh 185. I ordered XXL based on reviews here. Out of the box, it fit good. Wash it once, shrinks a bit. If you like slightly loose fitting clothes, order 2 sizes bigger than normal. If slightly smaller is OK, order 1 size bigger. Hard guess to make. All I can say is thirty five bucks is the max I would spend on this shirt. Shrinkage shows minor bunching around seams but will likely relax with wear. Not a bad shirt."
"The slippers are well made and pretty - just wished they fit according to size recommendations. Many other reviewers said that they ran small and I wished I listened to them. I have size 7 feet and the range says 6.5 -7.5. I thought they would be fine. Way to small. My daughter with a size 2 kids food fits into them, though!  ;) I am keeping this pair for her and ordering the next size up for me."
Pretty watch but the white on the band started to disappear after only using for several months
The smell was beyond what I could deal with
"The ankle support is really good.  The issue is below the ankle.  The shoe wears loose at the heal and the soul is very stiff, so it feels like your heal isn't on the soul of the shoe.  The disclaimer to this is that it is still a new shoe, so it isn't broken in yet.  The sold and heal of the shoe may soften up and allow for the shoe to fit more snugly at the base of the foot.  Time will tell."
I received these as a gift and they are so cute. Fit is good. However I have only worn them twice for just a few hours and they have peeled on the toe. I was hoping for the price they would have lasted longer.
"This is a nice shoe, but the size 10M was way to big. It wasn't a 10W either, but it fit like a 11-12. Also, in my humble opinion I think this shoe would probably look better on someone who has narrow feet or wears a smaller shoe size."
Not what I expected.  But wearable.
"My husband thought this shoe was very comfortable for walking.  He was shocked at how quickly the soles of the shoes wore down. He said he'd probably buy New Balance again, but not sure he'd get another pair of these. The sizing was pretty consistent with other shoes."
the Fur all to take off he is come to lags
Too big for me but the construction is well done.
"Vanity Fair makes nice under garments but this one is not a keeper. The material is not particularly soft and the neckline in the back is scooped rather low, which means the sleeves slip off of your shoulders while you sleep.  I tried wearing it for two nights and woke up in a tangle because the sleeve was almost to my elbows on one side. I doubt buying a smaller size would solve the problem since I bought the same size in the Shadowline, a much nicer fabric and better fitting nightgown."
My son is very skinny and the legs were still too tight.
"small ran really small, but overall a cute panty"
it's a nice comfortable bra but the girth was alittle snug so I returned it.  Otherwise if if wasn;'t snug I would have kept it.
"I really loved the look and feel of this corset. It looks just like it does in the picture in person, and I was not disappointed in the appearance at all. The only thing that made me give it three stars is that the second time I tried it on with my skirt, the boning on the right side popped out of the time and began jabbing me. I was able to sew it back up, but it was unfortunate. As I repaired it, I noticed that the fabric encasing the boning was very thin. Otherwise, great purchase and great fit."
"It shed a little, but for the price it was perfect for my costume!  As others have stated, please note that it doesn't open. I cut it and it worked out perfectly!"
"This shoe fit well and I really liked the style.  Unfortunately the inside stitching rubbed my small toes raw.  I called Merrell to ask if this was a design feature or a flaw; design feature.  However, they did a courtesy exchange for me with another shoe that is better: Merrell Moab.  Top notch service from Merrell and this is the first time I've had problems with any of their shoes.  I walk 3-5 miles 6-7 days a week, so I highly recommend the brand.  Their customer service is outstanding.  Hope this helps."
"I have finally worn through my old Merrell Jungle Mocs nursing shoes. So I called up Merrell shoes and clicked on white. The aluminum is not white. I will say that for the brief period that I had these on they were amazingly comfortable. But I can't wear silvery shoes on the floor. They're coming back, but I'm replacing them with another Merrell shoe."
I can now understand why this shoe is about half the price of my last pair of Sketchers.  The insole is not padded nearly as well as my old pair. I have never seen a Sketcher with such a skimpy insole.  I guess this is the economy model.  I will buy new insoles for these shoes and they will be fine.
"Made very, very  well,  and I'm sure it'd work great. I ordered a size up and I can't even get it done up"
"I bought this set to have some new pajamas following abdominal surgery.  I usually wear gowns but needed the 2 pieces during recovery. I also particularly bought the bamboo fabric as I have found it to be super soft in other sleepwear.  First, I normally wear a 1X but bought this set one size larger to allow for plenty of room and comfort.  After trying it on, it was a good thing I did because the top, even in the extra size was skimpy. Simply too tight in the bust. The bottoms, however, were so large that had there not been a drawstring they would have been on the floor. Not sure why the problems but I probably won't ever buy this brand again due to sizing variances.  On the plus side, the set will go to the women's shelter and maybe make one or two other people a good set or a good top or a good bottom. Finally, the set had a terrible odor upon being wet. Don't even have the words to describe accurately. After running through the dryer, it dissipated some but took a second washing and trip through dryer to rid itself of the noxious odor."
"Love the design and the bow, but fingers fit pretty tight."
"When I rec'd these pants I tried them on right away because if they didn't fit they were probably going back, and I like to wash all my new clothes before wearing them so I didn't want to take the tags off. They did fit but a little bit more snug than I would like and I know that the next sz which is 5 would be too big for me. Just so others have an idea I'm 5'5"" and about 115 LBS"
"as stated in other comments is too wide around the heals, heal grips you can use but be careful not to buy the gel ones, will give you blisters if its a sunny day."
The pants run on the small size. I don't like it when I bend over or sit down they dip below my butt crack or show my underwear.
Not even close to being jeans.  Look more like a dress slack.
"It's really cute and it fits fine,  but the first time I wore it the fabric at the neck started coming unraveled not the seam but the fabric itself. Can't return it since I've worn it and I trashed the plastic it came in. Bummer. Hopefully it was just the one. .."
"I bought a pair of these in '08. They were a much more substantial, supportive shoe. I read a lot of the reviews, but still ordered my regular size. My feet are more narrow than wide (though I do not wear a narrow shoe). I would say that if you have a wider foot - these might not work. I also would recommend sizing up by a half size as I feel my toes are close to the edge of the shoe."
"I did size up based on the reviews.  It could work for my bust, but even though I'm slim-hipped it just barely fit around-I could zip it but didn't want to hassle with having to tug to zip-back it goes"
"My daughter doesn't seem to fit Stride Rite sandals for some reason. She fits the tennis shoes fine, but the sandals pinch her feet. Too bad."
"Runs somewhat small, but a nice dress."
"Very comfortable but very long. Not really made for us shorter folks, Im 52 1/2. Good to wear around house but not flattering to wear out."
Its an ok dress to wear with maybe a Blazer or something. Its very see thru.
"Cute jacket nice material. However, extra material by the stomach if you zip the jacket can puff out and make you look like you have a little bit of a stomach. I have a small waist and do not like that aspect of the zipped look."
"This looks cute on. I'm 5' 6.5"" weigh 132 athletic with a small B cup. The bottoms could fit wider hips but not sure if it will fit a size 6. I'm a 3-4. A size 5 may fit this suit depending on body build. Would not suggest this to a xs 0-2. The bottoms tie at the sides and back but it fits a size small the best."
"I ordered a size 6 and they sent me a 5.  It's really too big to wear on my pinky and too small to wear on my ring finger (I had it measured at the jeweler, it is for sure a 5.).  The green stone is not at all like the photo.  The ring I received is VERY pale, almost clear/white with just a tiny tint of green in full sunlight.  The metal is beautiful and finely finished.  The design is simple.  I would have given it five stars if the color looked like the photo and they sent the correct size.  I attached a photo of it sitting on a white piece of paper.  It arrived in a small navy fabric pouch tucked inside of a cardboard box. I hope this review and photo are helpful to you."
"The pros: comfort
The cons: can aggravate PUPPS (pregnancy belly rash)"
Pretty but very thin. Good for very casual.
"Very cute shoes, but the leather is not very soft, which makes them not as comfortable as hoped for."
Wide was too large - returning.
"For the price, these shoes were good. They did fit a little small though."
Decently priced leggings. Okay quality; nice and soft. Fits as expected.
"Quality is great. Very beautiful top, but the XL fit like a medium."
"I really wanted to give these 5 stars because they did not itch, and they slid on easily.  They did not bind in any way.  Ironically, none of this mattered because after wearing them twice the crotch seam on the right side completely came apart.  I inspected it thoroughly and there is no fixing it.  The material is such that you can't sew it back in place because it has already unraveled. :(  Really disappointed."
"Quality is ok. Come along with nice box.
But the strap is smaller than expectation.
Overall ok.
Actually I bought 2"
Had to send back because didn't fit right. a litter snug. It's a nice dress and I wish it had fit
My fianc wears 9.5 10 and when I bought 10 it was too close
"returned , now what I expected"
"Ok, this shoe would get rave reviews.

I cannot describe how luxurious the fur is--unlike any other. It's like silk.  Plus, you're never cold with these.

And they are incredibly stylish.

Only one major peeve: the heel is too narrow and unstable. These are meant to be stylish comfort shoes.

If we wanted a narrow heel, they have a non-wedge version and I guiltily admit to owning that too. I wanted something I could wear during the day when at work or doing errands.

These heels are dangerous.  They should really adjust and offer something that is more stable and easy to use (others remarked about the driving being awkward).  Hence the 3 stars.

Also, the shoes run bizzarely small.  I wear a 9 in all brands, except La Canadienne, where even a 9.5 is a little narrow. Like others say, you need a 10. But it's now more than double in price what I paid for the 9.5, so it's out of the question...Once again, if you wear a 9, order the 10. One size up!

Strangest buying experience ever.

So please, you have the best shoes, please adjust and please make more. You've stopped the shearling mules.  But these are so popular.  Please issue ones with lower heels as well, you had one about five years ago."
Seems poorly made. I sent back. Don't think they'll last long.
"the holes for knuckles do not align. Maybe its jsut my knuckles, but the holes are spaced too fat apart for them. Which kinda defeats the purpose . other than that its nice smooth leather..."
I wish the foot had a little bit more room. The shoes are a little too tight.
Waist size was perfect but the length is a little too short.
needed serious ironing.
I had to return these because they were too small and narrow for my narrow feet.
"The fabric is very sheer and you can see right through the cream color. It is cheaply made, but will work as the under piece for a costume, but not as a dress as I had hoped."
Too tight.  Too much fiber residue on feet after wears.
"It is pretty, but very light weight, so much so that I have doubts as to the authenticity of the sterling silver, although it does have 926 stamped on the clasp, I am not convinced the necklace is.."
its weary small for size 36 eu
"The shoes are absolutely adorable but OMFG they smelled like freaking sharpie marker and some other weird chemical mixed together when I opened my package. I usually wear '7-7.5' in shoes. I ordered these in 7.5 but they were kinda tight. The width was fine, but my toes barely had room to move and the straps kept twisting around a lot which kinda razored into my ankles after I wore them for about an hour or so. Also the material for the shoe looks kinda cheap and it feels like a 'suede' like material. But they're still cute shoes, for the price I paid anyways."
"normally a size 14, these way too large for me. might need to try size 12"
I ordered my normal size and about half a size to big.
The boot itself fits okay but I wasn't to sure of the look. Boots look kinda cheap but okay for the price.
"Though I do like this slip tunic I was expecting it to be longer. It's more like a tank top, than the tunic I was expecting."
"Listed as a men's standard , but I had to use the last hole on band. I do not have a large wrist . The band was well made and did appear to be very hardy .Looked great on my watch , but I could not use , just to small ."
These aren't boy shorts.  I bought them because I had bought a Fruit of the Loom panties a few months ago that were called something like 'boyfriend shorts' that I really liked.  These aren't them.  These are what in my long-ago youth would be called bikini briefs.  There is nothing about them that says boyshort.  They also run a bit small.  I order a 7 - same as a did on the pairs I currently own that I like - and these are smaller.
"It would've been a good skirt if it was a little bigger, and I have a small waist."
"I purchased this as a gift for my neighbors child, an eight year old little boy.  Will let you know what he thinks after tomorrow, hee hee"
Slippers looked good and fit well. My only problem was a tag attacked to the inside of the slipper between the arch and the heel.  The tag constantly rubbed the bottom of my foot making the slipper uncomfortable to wear.  The tag was so securely attached that it was extremely difficult to remove.  I did finally remove the tag which left a small tare in the liner.
"Since these were petite pants, I expected them to fit better but still I had to hem them. The drawstring waist fit fine."
The clasp is oversize and a little too bulky in relation to the bracelet.
I love my wallet. The only thing I wasn't happy about is the small tear on the inside of it.
"I wear a 7.5 always have!!!! While these are cute, they run very very small! If you wear winter or even a semi thicker athletic sock theses will be too tight! I have to wear super thin socks or send them back. You need to order a full size bigger then normal"
This could look very nice...IF it fit properly!
Small but good product
I bought 1 size bigger and it was still small.  I am sent back and am ordering 2 sizes bigger.  I am having real problems with ordering dance shoes.  I ordered the Capezio charater shoes and they were huge.
I love the style of these flip flops as they are slightly more dressy than your standard flip flop. But these seem more narrow than my last pair that I bought with the same color and style. The straps on those shoes were slightly different. I am hoping they will break in because I loved the last pair I had but I left them at my brothers and my SIL has claimed them as hers. Maybe I'll do a switcheroo next time I visit and give her these so I can take my old pair back!
had to give to my niece...didnt like the fit
These sneakers are super cute but heavy.  A toddlers shoes shouldnt be this heavy.  Im going to return them.
fits tight on my wrist.
Good buy. quality a little thin for my taste.
I have a normal sized head and wanted a serviceable white hat for casual outdoors in the winter.  This is a nicely made hat of good quality but it does fit a little on the small size as though it was intended for a young teen.
Came on time - these are laces that I would use with more of a dress shoe.  They are thin and they are strong.  I ordered for some casual shoes and wanted something thicker and softer.  For dress shoes - they would be very good.
a little long in the sleeve
I like these shoes but they fit too big on me and I wear a size 12. So I probably need a size 11 shoe.
Probably a half a size too small or maybe a full size too small. I wore them for the wedding ceremony (in pain) and gave them away. Very cute though.
No real complaints about this jacket. It is just a basic unlined windbreaker.
OK for around the house
Someone might be wearing them now...it is Friday and comfy time
"Pros:
-Cute style
- Good Length
Cons:
-I'm 5'2,127 lb but and I bought a small and it's not as fitted as I would like."
"I ordered a pair of Hounds the same day - same size.  When I received them both, the Hounds fit perfectly.  The Dawgs are a little big, width wise.  I ordered same size, same width in both.  I am going to keep the Dawgs because of the hassle of returning, but Hounds fit better."
"Cute mini-backpack, perfect size to use in place of a handbag.

However, i wish the straps were padded."
I love the materials. I love the wide bands. It feels great on but it is definitely larger than I am used to. I almost need to wear padding to fill out the cup.
"Had high hopes for these. Always thought i had an average foot, but either my foot is wide, or these run narrow. Could feel the steel toe onot my biggest and smallest piggies."
Got these for the pool but the straps do fit large and I sized down as suggested. These I can not wear all day since they are really loose. But they are really stylish.
"I didn't like it much, I gave it away as a gift instead."
"Material feels good, runs way too small."
It is basically a stretchable t-shirt. Nice quality material.
"Bought these as a gift, didn't get an answer back to know if the person appreciated the gift or not."
"I purchased five of these shirts at the same time.  Within a couple washings, all but one has the bottom hem undone.  Material also snags very easily.  That said, they are very comfortable and breathe well, preferable to the Nike and UA wick-aways in fit and comfort; just not so in durability.  Sizing is perfect for XXL."
It's small and does it job but it's bulky
"These boots were just a hair narrower than i expected.  The upper material is not coated with a DWR finish and wets easily, but I don't know if it soaks through.  I experienced pretty bad over pronation when wearing these (ankles rolling inward) so I have to send them back. Overall finish and quality was quite good, just wish they worked for me.

I emailed New Balance customer support about my fit issues and they quickly recommended a different type of boot to correct over pronation. We'll see how this new boot fits when it arrives, but for now I'm very impressed with New Balance customer support!"
"I JUST LOVE AMBER, I HAVE ALOT OF PIECES.
BUT THESE ARE A LITTLE BIG ON MY EARS.
THEY ARE VERY NICE BUT BIG."
will not dry it
"Love the style, and I love Jade. I had previously purchased the necklace and then decided to order the earrings. Disappointed that the color did not match."
My husband looked on my list and ordered this dress for me. However this dress pictured is not what arrived. Instead a different dress with a tight scrunched skirt and a scoop neck arrived. I was stunned and even went back to check what he ordered to make sure it wasn't my husbands mistake. It wasn't
Good product that wears well but is not radio controlled as was indicated in the ads. I like the brand but would like the radio control so I do not have to think about keeping it set.
"Horribly cheap and spindly, but with some creativity and crafty hands, one can transform this piece of garbage into an incredible staff of power!

The Wizard I transformed this staff for, was impressed and greatful!  Spells were cast with might and potency.

P.S.
The LED color changing Power Stone at the top, is worth the price of admission, and looks really cool at night!

See my picture"
Ordered a medium (I am a size 8) and it was way too small. Returned the skirt.
"The pants looks good quality is nice,  hopefully keeps the color, it seems skyni but in reality is wide at the bottom, which I do not like is that it has a size real, ordered a size 1 and is like a size 5, a person weighing 50, 55 kilos one size 1 is not going to serve should do smaller."
These glasses are nice but fit me to big...
"For me, I like this suit.  Love the shorts under but the bustline in this one seems to run a little smaller
for the size I ordered.  Cute and maybe if I tighten the straps some, it'll fit better.  Great suit for an older gal."
Wire. Wire is evil. And this wire sneaks up on you when you turn the wrong way and stabs you.
there to long an they don't look like the shoe in the picture but there not that bad tho
"I'm used to Vibram Five fingers 3mm so these were a little thick on the bottom for my tastes. But they still feel better than regular sneakers.

(edit 6/20/2013)

I wore these on my vacation to Rome and I found out that they were def. the wrong size for me. There are 2E I think I'm a 4E or whatever the widest size is in sneakers. After the first day of walking all day, I had blisters and sores all around my feet. It would be nice if they sold a wider size."
IT'S VERY NICE
"While these are a little cheaper price-wise than other companies' pajamas, the fabric is a lot thinner and a little scratchy. The transfer on the front (the monster) is also a little thin and doesn't wash well. These are fun pajamas and my son was comfy in them after a wash. They're just not as cozy as I'd have expected from a brand like Gerber. They felt cheap and a bit flimsy."
"O.K.  Admittedly I have put on some pounds over the years.  I have many pairs of pants that are 34x34, jeans included.  The 34x34 size is a bit small, not too small, just smaller than I would like.  I decided to go up a size and bought a couple pairs of jeans and a pair of khakis is a 36x34.  These were too big.  So I decided to find the middle ground and was quite excited when I saw that these jeans were available in a 35x34, which is a hard size to find.  I tried them on and then tried on a pair of the old 34x34 to compare and the fit was nearly identical. I guess it's time to workout."
Very skimpy!
These weren't any good for me. They don't fit muscular legs. I believe I got a 33 inch waist and I'm 6'0'' and 185 lbs. I'm pretty muscular and they didn't fit my thighs and ass.
"I was disappointed when I received this necklace for two reasons.  The first is probably my fault for not paying attention to detail, but I was expecting the wreath portion to be about the diameter of a 50-cent piece, and it is only about the size of a dime.  Also, some of the colored stones are not set centered in their ""crater.""  But other than that, it seems to be of good quality for the money."
Again...Size does matter. It didn't occur to me that these were made for above ankle boots and that I was looking for slightly above the ankle zippers.  The product seems great though.
"It's an adorable top but it doesn't fit right. This top isn't for just anyone. It would be great to show off abs.

I received this product at a discount"
Even though I ordered a large it's not as stretchy as other swimsuits and I am a 36C and the top portion fits small but I bought it to motivate me for when I do loose these last few pounds!  So I'm looking forward to wearing it this summer!
Get a size down from size chart.
Great shades for the price.
A 3 rating only because my size ordered is too large. I would suggest to go down a size or two. Otherwise the material is really nice.
"i bought these strictly as ""bedroom"" shoes, and to be honest i wouldn't wear them for much else. very stiff inexpensive materials and the stones are not all afixed straight so some glue shows. for sure get these on sale if you purchase them"
"Way smaller than size. So they run small, also the straps are twisted so hoping they twist straight and uniform."
"I wear size 12.5 shoes and they seem tight at first, but I will know after I wash them if they fit better."
They fit a bit small.
Very cute. Fabric was a bit rough not as soft and plush as it looks or is described but it still a solid built item.
"It did fit as expected, but whn the boy sits the front opening, opens up and his pen,,, comes out."
These briefs are okay if you don't need a fly.
Top of Jeans needs better support
"Had to return, was too snug for my normal to large size adult head."
I ordered a 7 1/2 size in the silver and they are way too big.  The silver is very pretty. The design is lovely and the heel height is just right for me.  I would like to order again but not sure what size to order.
The shirt had horrible fabric but it was pretty. Just didn't fit
It does its job but it's a 20g rather than the standard 18g. You need to pry it open and the close it manually so if you bend it that wrong way it will stay like that. It's also not worth 10$ for a thin piece of metal but overall it's alright.
"Really nice dress, but it runs a little short so we have returned and ordered the next size.  Hopefully it will fit better.  If you are looking for a knee length dress I would recommend ordering up a size."
Very thin and a very shinny---looks a little cheap.
"I like them, they are sporty, but the shoe cuts in slightly to run up against the big toe. If your foot geometry is like mine with a straight foot (no bunions or inward-turning toes) you'll feel the same thing. I can't wear the new Nikes for this same reason. It's not a total loss for the shoe (it looks really good), but not sure if I'd want to run the risk of blisters to do hard core training in them."
Way to big for my sons ears
"This is a nice product but, as said by others, I wish I could have picked my own scarves.  Four of them looked alike--2 were the same designs as each other, just similar colors.  I work in food and they frequently fall off of my head.  The material is silk, so that could be why, but overall I probably wouldn't be inclined to buy these again as they don't do the job I bought them for."
Cute top but bottoms are way to small for size 12.
"Way to long even for me 5'8, they were cute to wear but the bottom legs were very flared out more than a normal boot cut so if you like the 70's style jeans buy these they are not PLUS SIZE if your a 14 the seller needs to be careful or they will lose sales by being insulting they were very dark grayish black denim hope this helps"
"It is cute, but is slightly too small compared to her other size 5."
Very pretty.  I received several compliments.  Be sure to  handwash (or on delicate) because it rips very easily.
These underpants are awful! I normally wear a small but with these there's no room for anything. It's like they're kids sized or something. Not impressed. Stuck with a bunch of boxers that don't fit!
This is not the best fit for me as I need elastic in the waist due to a liver transplant.  But it is a durable jean and does not lose its color very  much  at all.  Legs are nice width.
"The collars are crazy big.  You want the Propper Uniform Polo if you want nice polo, not this.  I don't know WTF they were thinking with that collar.  It is ridiculous."
It's ok.  Not very comfortable but provides a decent amount of support.
I was expecting a little shine to these earrings but they are have a flat finish -- too dull for me. I returned them.
"My husband does like this short as it is a well finished garment, although it is made with a very delicate fabric that will not last longer."
"I was looking for a pair of comfortable walking flats that would look good with a casual dress type outfit. I thought this shoe, with its cute leather button, would be just my (indie girl) style.

First off, my feet are pretty much exactly size 8.5 for most shoes. I don't think my feet are particularly wide either--I wear normal shoes in my normal size. But for some reason, my 8.5B (normal width, according to the measurement chart) shoes were super, uncomfortably narrow... yet the tip extended almost an inch past my toes. Also, you can't really tell in the picture but the tip is stub-nosed and squarish, which is not really my thing. I'm sending this pair back."
"Wayyyy too big. It's not tight or sexy, and it's kind of long on me. I'm 5'6 105 lbs. It goes down to my hips and doesn't hug at all. I am giving 3 stars because the fabric is nice and the quality is good for the price. Order your true size though,  don't size up if you want this sweater to be fitted like the pictures."
"Very high heel and oddly built.  Really wanted to like this boot.  So I kept trying them on but honestly I could not walk across the floor.  They were an odd feeling boot.  My foot seemed to swim around, the heel is quite high. But at the same time they felt to short.  Also they hit in a strange area of my ankle.  I love Tom footwear and own several pair of flats this was my first try with a boot and heel.  I had to return the boots as I feel I would have fallen off them"
"Nice, but shorter than I thought they would be."
"I bought the body suit in rust and while it is a gorgeous color, it was pretty low cut and fit my petite shoulders a bit strange. I sent it back and got the more plain cut one without the zipper in navy and I like it much better, since it doesn't scoop down so far  in the front or back."
Made well but my cards tend to slide out of this....
"It is not big.  Its narrow maybe half the size of the picture, not as fluffy, but very nice quality.  I will keep it."
"I think these pants are for bigger bodies. I have an athletic frame and thin long legs, and these pants are quite baggy."
"Bought this product just a few months ago. Used it only a few times, when it was raining of course. Then the other day, I felt there was something in my boot. I took it off to tap out the debris. Then the boot cracks! The boots are made out of cheap material. Not worth the purchase. I can only hope that I can fix the crack with some Gorilla glue..."
"I think I would have liked these shoes, but they were too short so had to return.  I wear an 11 in ASICS, but 11 in the RYKA was way too short.
Not sure they came in a larger size."
It is confortable and look wonderful but the material and some part was be cheat . The size is true I usually 8. Is confy
"Compared to another trouser I have the same size, these are a bit snug although they were to be relaxed fit."
I really liked the design but it ran way too tight for me.
"The extent of RFID snooping may be somewhat hyped, but as products like one designed by Bishop Fox show (sorry, you'll have to look it up), it's more of an issue in industrial settings than for individual citizens.

That said, this wallet has RFID snooping resistance as a net plus.

The design has 3 card pockets on each side, and space for a couple more by sliding beneath.

The wallet seems sturdy, though I notice there is a stitch on the outside surface that might conceivably break after heavy use.

I would rather have a much fatter wallet that held more cards and IDs. The cards and gadgets have to go somewhere, hence the popularity of cargo pants, with their numerous pockets ready for smartphones, battery packs, keys, and -- relevant to this discussion -- a wallet and the overflow cards that don't fit in one.

The typical wallet design -- can you blame Lewis N Clark for designing to the popular notion? -- is designed for paper currency, but with some occasional exceptions, currency is less often used by many of us. I needed it today for a cash-only venue, but that was the first time in six weeks, so I had only a general idea what was in the wallet. Wallets should be designed less for paper currency and more for IDs and paper maps (e.g., folding map or mass transit schedule -- needed during smartphone outages or travel settings).

If you've downsized your life so that you don't need so many cards, congratulations. You win the Luddite Award. systems.

I guess the rest of us are stuck with baggy, pocket-laden pants."
The rim of the hat is actually broader than it appears in the picture
"Wife says: I got this product for review and to be fair was not sure what to expect. The perfume is to be sprayed on hair to get a desirable smell. I liked the smell a lot. My big concern, however, was the alcohol in the ingredient list, which may be an issue with people like me. Also, it is quite a pricey product, so need to be mindful of that."
"If you are looking for a basic prisoner costume then this is a good buy. Nothing fancy. Material is thin, almost see thru. Not suitable for cold weather. It was roomy enough that my son wore a tshirt under which kept him warm."
"It initially does appear to give your hair a fuller look.  However, on closer look, it mainly falls to the scalp.  I didn't have problems with sweat or it staining my clothing, etc, but I didn't use it for too long for fear that people would notice that my scalp appeared black.  I have a slightly fuller head than typical guys that are looking at this product, but my hair is thin, and my scalp does show in brighter lighting.  I was hoping this product could disguise that.  In a sense, it does on passing glance or from a distance.  I have not had the courage to try it at work."
"kinda cheap, and bottoms are large"
"Glamorise Women's Front Close Stretch Lace Wonderwire Bra, White, 40DD
Fit was a little small and was very itchy while wearing it."
It is a beautiful vest and since we live in Florida we fish a lot. The only problem I had was I ordered a XL and received a XXXXL. Very durable and may even purchase a few for Christmas gifts
Nice was larger than I was expecting. But nice to carry you tablet or I pad along with you.
"These jeans are for my husband.  He keeps his iphone in the side leg pocket.  I used to buy him 33 X 30 & the phone fit perfectly in the pocket.  He lost a few pounds & always complained that the length was a bit long, so I bought 32 X 29.  The length is great, but the pocket is too small to fit his iphone.  Very disappointed about that."
"I like the cut and length (about 3-4"" above knee, I'm 5'2"") BUT it runs tight (I'm a solid small, sometimes x small, ordered small) and the fabric is quite thin.  Have not washed it yet. BUT it's so hard to find cotton blend clothing online that I may keep it."
"Not to be used every day.  Definitely turns a funny color (not the stone, just the ring itself) right a way."
Beautiful design. Shrinks in the wash.
Not awful but it's not loose loose like I had hoped. The sleeves aren't as long as I'd hoped either. I bought a size bigger too. They have this same shirt with shorter sleeves for cheaper at target.
Runs VERY small. I bought a medium and I usually purchase a small in other brands of hoodies and they are perfect. This medium looks and fits like an extra small.
"I thought that the product (being cotton) would be very soft- it's actually quite itchy and it doesn't fit very well. Note: IF YOU ARE CURVY THEN STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!!! both as harem pants AND a jumper, the outfit looks strange- I now just wear it to bed or when I'm belly dancing"
"The gore on this bra was too high and stuck outward. The cups were nice though, very comfy with a nice stretch. Unfortunately, since the gore wouldn't lie down properly, I had to get rid of this one."
These shirts are pretty and comfy but are way too short.  One washing and they hover around at the waist.
"From reading the reviews, I expected the sizes to run small. The quality is good but they're too large for me."
"I both love these boots (my daughter practically lives in them and gets a lot of complements on them since they are hot pink and light up), BUT...the lining inside is a joke and kind of frustrating. It's literally paper thin fabric that is not even glued down so as you would expect it butches up and falls out. I'm not sure why it's even there. I had to buy other insoles at the store and cut them to size to go into these shoes. I really hope they would fix that problem otherwise I would get another pair for my other daughter."
The strip of material on the heel that hold up the strap bends awkwardly and slips to the side of the foot.
Bought the wrong size apparently they did feel great
It's not a strong pants. Mine lasted 6 months.
narrow in the toe box and wide on the calf. very good leather.
Fit good work well except insoles came loose so I just took them out and they are fine!
Great shape and awesome glasses but they barely glow in the dark.
"I like the make and material of the shirts. It comes as two shirts, the blue under and the orange over. The size shows what I ordered, an XL, but its too small. That surprised me as I've bought a different Dragonball shirt from the same maker and the size XL size was perfect."
These are not the old school Vans- these are more akin to Keds... TOO NARROW and NO padding! Boo
"Larger than expected. I followed the advice from some of the other reviews and ordered a US Size Large based on other buyers feedback.  Fit is pretty loose and sloppy. Should have went with a US Medium. For reference, I'm 5'-10"" 185 lbs."
"I normally order things I like and don't wear them immediately. I do try them on but trying them on and actually wearing them are two different things. I finally wore them after breaking a toe, to find that they are a bit tight. It's an okay shoe. But I think I would have returned them."
"I ordered this item large because I sometimes can't gauze internet item, so it was too large. but the product itself was nice."
"Great looking shoes but I was a bit shocked when I pulled the insoles out to insert a pair of Dr. Scholls insoles. There are two rivets which are raised with rough jagged edges See picture. The rivets can't be felt with the insoles installed, but I can certainly see how the rivets could grind into the insoles over a short period of time. I've decided to keep the shoes and hope the rivets don't create issues for my insoles and ultimately my feet. I'd give them 4 stars if it weren't for this issue."
Cute and flattering but the underwire popped out the first time I wore it!
Ordered this dress in white and in coral. The white was completely see through and the coral was more like hot pink. Size was good and style is cute but I had to return these.
"Bought them for my 11 and 9 yr old kids.
At first, they were awesome.  Easy to put on. We are at 5 months of use.
The 11 yr olds laces have become stringy, like stretched out after 3 months. We are still getting use out of them by tying the ends as well, since the clips have become lost and don't stay shut.
My 9 yr olds pair, however, snapped on one of the laces.  He solved his issue while at school, by undoing the lace, and just wrapping it around the shoe so he could walk home. I'll take pics later.
Overall, good idea, but they don't last. So I marked it ""OK"", though I would give a 1 star."
I am allergic to the thread that was used at the seams. They work well as a second layer in cold environment.
Too small to wear as full-length pants. I will probably cuff them up to resemble a clam-digger type pant. The next size up is a 6Long and my 5 year old is very tiny. Shirt is rather small as well.
"Looks good, but a bit tight.  Rubs the wrong places, making it hard to wear all day without hurting feet.  Not as comfortable as other Sperry sneaker designs."
Fare.
I like it but it runs small. Looks bigger in picture
"These looked very nice and were what I was looking for. They were much to small for me. I didn't think to check the size because I knew I was returning them. They did the fastest return of anyone I've dealt with. I know the product is what is to reviewed, but when I buy clothes I want to feel comfortable returns won't be a major hassle and this company did great."
"I had to go down a half size after returning the item for being too large
Width was good now we will have to see if going down a half size
will work..stay tuned"
"I have a pair of ECCO Seattle Slip-Ons size 44 that fit perfect so I assumed the ECCO Men's Dublin Apron Toe Slip-Ons size 44 would fit the same way...unfortunately this was not the case.  The Dublin Slip-Ons fit is smaller, tighter and hurt my feet after wearing them several times.
Might have to return them."
"Biggest disappointment was discovering that the sides of the tongue were stitched to the sides of the shoe opening all the way up.  Even though there is some elastic webbing in there, it makes it VERy difficult to get the shoe on if you have even slightly wide feet.  Once I managed to stuff my Fred Flintsone like foot through the opening they were a great fit, but they are just way more effort to get on than I was looking for.  Change that opening and I'd automatically make them 5 stars because of price, comfort, light weight, color selections etc"
"It's a beanie what do you expect. It fits alright, but needs to be a little bigger."
"A little narrow, fit is not as comfortable for a basic slide. My dog loves them though"
"I followed the sizing information, but this was still way too small."
I got a large cause I am a size twelve and its big.
It says that its leather but i don't thing it is the quality its not what i was expecting but it is a good looking wallet.
Too big for my taste & my wrist
had to return them
Fits very good but over time it stretches and color fades fast.
"Very nice ring that I got for my wife. Looks great but be careful, the pearl has fallen out twice. I have reattached it and she has been lucky not to lose it each time.  Very nice to the look but like I said be careful of its disability."
"wasn't expecting it to be that short .came just below my bra,wasn't allowed to wear it"
Mask smashes the face-not really manufactured logically if it is to be worn.  Weird.
I got this as a bodysuit for a costume. I normally wear a 36B so i assumed that one would fit. The bust had way too much room left but the bottom part was hard to get into.
"I ordered the wrong size, so I can't really give an accurate review.  However, I  will say that the material used doesn't seem comfortable enough to wear under clothes; seems awkward.  But, again...I didn't order the right size, so take this review with a grain of salt."
"Unfortunately, these didn't work for me and I ended up just getting a strapless bra instead.  I felt that they pulled weird on the straps causing them to not lay flat."
"Great looking watch BUT if you don't have alot of experience sizing watch bands this one will give you trouble. Most reviews on this don't give you good details on HOW to remove the links so i'll give it my best shot... Unlike most bands that have regular pins this one has""L"" shaped pins that can only be removed from the inside of the band (the part that your wrist physically touches while your wearing it. Your best bet is using the normal punch and hammer kit for watches, lay the watch face down on a shower towel (so you do not damage it) and tap out just under the ""arrow"" until you see the pin start to ride out. Then using a small flathead screw driver , place underneath the pin and slowly pry it out. After you've done this and are SURE you've sized it properly i highly recommend you add a very small drop of super glue to the pin to insure that it will not back out. Its a great great watch and I like it so far!... I hope this helped you. GOOD LUCK!"
Thesr are ok but run small. Id suggest ordering a size up. Other than that they're very well made.
"These booties are very stylish. The color was slightly darker that I thought it would be, but still distinctively brown. I've worn them walking around the city, through work days, and running errands. They fit me well, and I'd say their level of comfort depends on how comfortable your socks are - at the office and doing errands I was fine, but after 4 hours of walking the city streets my feet hurt a bit. I think I may buy some sort of inserts for them before my trip to Spain, the purpose for which I bought them. All these things are fine and understandable and would have gotten 5 stars... but there's something they do that can drive me nuts at times. The left heel clacks differently than the right one. I don't know if I just happened to get a defective shoe, but it has a weird echo to it that the other bootie doesn't. I've tried walking slightly different in stride and pace but it seems to be a resilient sound.  The material of these shoes seems sturdy enough and they're rather cute so I won't bother returning them because I've been trying to wear them in before my trip. I wonder if anyone else has had a similar experience to mine, or maybe I've just inherited my mother's supersonic hearing. Either way, I have to dock 2 points for it because I find the sound horribly irritating and because I may need to find a cobbler to investigate if it's fixable."
very small...gave these to my daughter.
quality of product and zippers didn't hold up
"I read the feedback and bought two sizes up.  But it was wayyy too big. A bit disappointed. Since the XL said size 8 10( which is my size). This was a bit misleading.
I'll just have to buy my correct size next time."
"Will return this week. Would order smaller size than usual, but suspect while it would fit, still too over sized for me. Width and length seem too long, although the bagginess might be good for large guys. Fabric seems good, medium weight."
"Cute, but Really long! Like a review before mine, I am 5""3, but 200 lbs. & They could cover my entire leg. It was odd. But they did fit comfortably. Just be warned, if you are under 5""4, I'd say this will be too long for you. But they are doable. Just obviously made too long for shorter thicker ladies. Other than that, accurate look, & received it within 9 days (in standard shipping)."
Buckle sometimes lets the belt slip and loosen. Webbing is not sturdy enough use for holstering full sized items. Good buy for light duty holding up pants.
the strap was a bit short
Like the color and appearance however it snaps shut with a loud noise.
"Dickies are required uniform pants for our school, but oh, I wish they had adjustable waists, or were available in size slim! They wear well, retain color and quality, and are all-around wonderful, except for the sizes. I've had the problem with all three girls, but this daughter is the skinniest. I always take tucks in the top, but with four pockets, there is only so much room for tucks, and these literally fall off. She'll just have to keep wearing the size 6, which is tucked at the top, and above her ankles at the bottom."
Not long enough in the torso!
It's not exactly like the picture but it's still flipping cute!
They are pretty but way too big.  I need to exchange.
TOO MANY
They ate nice bit said size 10-13 but I am 5ft7  and 260 pounds they slide down. When they don't  slide they sre too tight.
Small buy nice and I use it with other eternity bands to stack.
"Okay, bought a pair before.they were much cuter, also they scuff very easily."
"I like the style, but they rub my feet the wrong way."
"The shoes are great, cute, but no room for arch supports so I haven't worn them as much as I'd like.  Comfortable otherwise."
"These are extra wide, but still hard to get the foot in the shoe.  Once on, seem to fit comfortably, but my son is super happy to have them off after a few hours."
I've had other shoes that took 2 days to break in and that's fine. After wearing these for a few days I returned them because they never got comfortable. After wearing these for a couple of hours my knees and shins would hurt.  I'm normally not picky about my shoes but these were too uncomfortable to keep.
It's a bit cheap looking.
Pretty flimsy. Came crumpled in a bag all wrinkled and overall poorly made. Looks good from afar not up close. Super thin and see through.
"Not a heavy flannel like my previous Legendary Whitetails flannel purchase. This is a light weight shirt, don't expect it to keep you warm."
I am a medium normally so I ordered an XL. I suggest you order 2 sizes larger.
"I was looking for good quality business casual socks.  The assorted brown pack came in nice designs, however, after a few months of use and washing the material started feeling polyester-y and rough.  Given the price, it would seem in line with the performance, but was hoping they would last better."
Gave them to a friend!
"These are work gloves.  They are thick in the fingers and are very warm.  I love the padded palm and actually use them as cycling gloves.  They work better than every cycling glove I've tried.  You won't be using these for things that require fine motor skills but they definitely work well as work/warm gloves.  I knocked off a star because the wrist wrap leaves a hole that exposes skin on the outer portion of your wrist.  After a while in windy conditions, this leads to your wrist getting really cold.

UPDATE:  After wearing these for about 2 weeks, the touch screen capability on the finger tips stopped working. I knocked off a star for that."
"I got this fast, I think one or two days after I ordered it.  It is a costume, so it isn't up to everyday wear quality.  I had to iron it, and the hoop did bend weird.  The hoop problem was fixed when I by accident broke the hoop.  After that the circle was a little smaller, but it lay perfectly.

As far as size, I'm 5'2 and a size 4-6.  It fit me perfectly.  If you have a lot up top, or if you're tall, this costume probably won't fit."
Not real happy the fit is way to big and the color is way to royal in my opinion. I do plan on ordering more t-shirts only not in this color or size.
A little bummed as the product I received isn't whats pictured. The one that arrived has a keyhole button closure on the back and MUCH skinnier arms. Worried it won't fit as I expected it to based on the picture.
"Too narrow in the shoulders. Somewhat small in the body. Nice & lightweight. More junior than women's.
Hopefully it will keep me warm"
I've never been disappointed in anything I bought from Amazon...but I'd received so many praises about the comfort of these shoes I couldn't help but be disappointed that Sketchers seem to run a little small.  I wish I had waited to see if I could find the 10 1/2 advertised earlier...I'm sure I would be singing their praises too.
"I love my purse. However the first day I used it, a piece that wraps around the strap came unstiched & fell off. Now I will have to return it or pay to have it fixed. Bummer."
nit very flattering
"I have numerous pairs of Clarks shoes and have always found them consistent in sizing and great comfort so I am a bit disappointed in these as they hurt my feet after a while. They are quite narrow and the strap goes across the widest part of your foot. I am hoping they will stretch a bit with wear as I have had many compliments on them. The zipper in the back is wonderful, wish all my sandals fastened this way."
Not what it shows in the pic.
"I am 24 weeks pregnant and my boobs won't stop growing. I have grown attached to a Champion sports bra, but thought a new addition would be nice. There is not enough support to wear this out of the house, but is very comfortable to wear at home and give the girls a little support while still letting them breath."
"Cute, but extremely thin. Had to return."
"The sweater is very thick and well made. I ordered a medium, but should have gotten a small because it runs big.  However I will be returning the sweater as the fit really isn't like the model on the picture. Meaning the sides/waist area does not hug but instead rather loose.  Overall a great sweater just doesn't fit how I thought it would."
"I typically have good experiences with Merrell shoes, but with this shoe I have some reservations. The outside sole and rubber toe coating are excellent for keeping the shoe from getting wet or losing grip in inclement weather. My main qualms with this shoe is the stability. The shoe is slightly larger than other Merrell shoes that I've worn in the past which were the same size (13 D-M) and as result I feel that my foot moves around too much making it a poor shoe for hiking or other serious outdoor activities. I was going to return this product but I had already worn them outside and I'm not sure what amazon's policy is on returning shoes after wearing them. Overall, I'm sadden to say that I was disappointed with this shoe."
pretty but daintier than appears in photo and runs a little small in fit.
When received one of the zip pull strings was already detached from the zip. Didn't think it a big deal and my son started using it for school. Now 2 weeks later a second zip pull is broken. I'm returning this bag as I think its a manufacturing fault but have also ordered a new one as my son likes it and it does seem a well made bag other than the zip pulls. I will add a review of the zip pulls on the new bag
"This product is fine, but it didn't suit our needs. It really is more for displaying for sales rather than for personal use, I think. My daughter asked me to return it and get one of the smaller ones from Kloud City."
"I usually wear a medium, but ordered a large. The large is also too small."
A little thicker throughout the watch body than expected
"Runs small, I should ordered a size larger, returned it."
"It's small - really small - but perhaps that is how a shrug is supposed to fit. I needed it for a costume, it served it's purpose...probably will never wear it again."
"stains easily, lasted me a few months will try the black next"
"The shirt is cute, but an XL was very large.  It looks like a maternity shirt."
Not sure if it was a manufacturer mistake but the large stuff pocket on the back does not have a hidden magnet as indicated both on product description and the attached product description - disappointed
I have been buying this brand for quite a while. Lately the fit has not been the same they run a little small
really cheap/bad fit
kind of strange cut... hangs kind of weird but I can work with it
Pretty boring wood color/detail
These were much smaller than I expected. Maybe a way to show carat size would have helped me choose the size I had in mind. Sparkle factor is there.
"Boots need to be broken in, I prefer to wear medium weight socks (maybe that's why they seem narrow). I applied waterproof spray, feet stayed dry. They are more stylish than other boots, the color choices are neutral, I can live with that during mud season in New England."
"I am 5'2 and weigh 114. I have a pooch that runs in my family lol. We are petite with bellys. I have to workout and watch what I eat. If I eat a chip or frie my belly will come back like the Terminator. I am still on the hunt for a seamless version. This one was very comfy. I ordered the small, so the xsmall probably could have gotten my tummy flatter. My concern is the boning showing through light colors. This will work for darker/heavier clothing. I want to wear my maxi dresses. A lot of the others have shorts, thongs, ect with them and I am not interested in those. If anyone finds one that is seamless similar to this one, let us know. I have included pictures."
Left shoe hurting foot not sure why
"nice sweats, but they do run small."
"These are nearly as comfortable as I had imagined.
They are slightly narrow in the toes for shoes sold a wide."
"This is basically a rectangular piece of fabric frayed at the edges, but stylish and a good price."
"Basic scrubs, thin material, some strings hanging, loose fit, easily wrinkled. Fit better after couple washings. If this is what's affordable at the moment, by all means this does the job. If you can spend a little more, go for something like Dickies that is of higher quality, you'll be more satisfied."
"The watch itself is pretty good, but I over estimated my ability to quickly tell time with a watch with no numbers on it.  That's my bad.  However, the watch is very pretty and looks great on my wrist."
Love the color.  The fabric is a little lighter weight than I expected.
Nice product but fit not as described.
It does not give much support.  I use it for around the house on my day off from work or for housecleaning.  I am a size DD.
The bottom soles are fraying.  Ive never seen that before.  It makes them hard to wear to work.  Otherwise extremely comfortable.
"Nice and pretty organizers, but the material that it is made out of is a little on the cheaper side.  But they did organize my suitcases very nicely!"
Good fit but hard to take it off.
"What a HASSLE to put on! ONLY because I hate fumbling with zippers, ties, and buttons in general. That's just a personal preference. Also felt the dress was snug in the back and chest area.

Because of the lining and material, the dress is a little thicker and heavier than I thought it would be, which is nice as it speaks to the quality of the garment. Might not feel comfy in warmer settings or if one gets hot easily.

Otherwise, it's actually quite stunning on and off the hanger. I will keep it and make it work. Especially for the cooler climate. Not a great dress but certainly not bad either."
"The cut is weird, but under a flowy sweater, it's cute. The fabric leaves a lot to be desired - like cheap polyester/costume grade."
Too small for my boots
The color was off was more pinkish than red.
The skirt part was a little thin. I also didn't realize that there was a side zipper on this dress which I typically try and avoid side zippers. It was a return.
Nice but fuzz all over sweatshirt
"Not as soft as the stripy socks I ordered elsewhere (more like nylons than socks--not so much thin as simply stiff/scratchy). Not a total disappointment, but will not be buying again."
"I really wanted these shoes, I like the style and the price was great.  Unfortunately when I received them I wasn't able to wear them.  I usually order a size 7 but decided to go up to a 7.5 based on reviews stating the shoe ran small.  When they arrived I could hardly get my foot into them and they were so narrow I could tell they weren't going to work for me.  If you have a very narrow foot and you can order either a half or possible whole size larger than you usually get they might be a good shoe for you.  I don't like to have to guess about the size when ordering shoes, they should be the size they say they are!"
I loved this corset as soon as I saw it so I ordered it.  But when it arrived and I tried it on I was disappointed.  But I just gave it as a gift .  They are sure enjoying it.
"I've been wearing these shirts for many years and they're fine. However, there's been a visual change that I don't like: the old ones had a 'matte' appearance that changed at some point and the new ones are shiny. The material feels pretty much the same to me, I just don't like the looks of them now. Most shirts of this type are shiny now, so perhaps NB felt they should go along, but to me it removes any reason to buy NB rather than something else.

Also, they have changed the sizing. I wear an XL in most running shirts and they are generally loose on me (I wear a L in regular shirts) but to get an equivalent in the new NB shirts, I buy a 2XL."
"I previously purchase a blue pair. They are great, and wanted another color, for some reason, this new pair doesn't feet right, too narrow."
"I like the product, it just runs small & I won't be able to wear it, but it will make a nice gift. It was delivered on time, as advertised."
"The sizing is odd. I'm XS and got a Small, but then I read again and it's because the size says it's XS/S. I would say is not an XS but an S, so it looks somewhat large on me. Anyway, I'm not returning it."
"Nice looking bra (purchased it in black), and unlined (a plus for me), but the fabric on straps and decorative trimming is rough and itchy. In a couple of minutes I had a full bra imprint on my body. On a positive side, due to roughness, straps do  not slide and stay the length you set them. Sizing seems to be inflated. I own 3 Wacoal bra styles (not a full coverage ones) in 32C, but this one in 32C was too small in cups (will go back). I also ordered 32D that fits right, but still is itchy-scratchy, so I am on the fence about this one."
"my kid felt in love with these at the Melissa Store but they did not had the size at that time, so we ordered them, she could not wear them for more than 15 min that all her feet hurt!!!!"
"I don't like the elastic in these shorts. The elastic combined with the rough texture means these shorts rub on my skin in a bad way. I need to wear an undershirt, or tucked-in shirt to be completely comfortable in these shorts.

The cell phone pocket is great for a smaller phone such as iPhone 5... but my Samsumg S6 doesn't fit in it.

I like the Large rear-thigh pocket and side pocket

The 5.11 Tactical Operator Belt is too thick to fit under these belt loops"
the jacket the zipper will not stay together
"My husband loved the look and feel of this watch, but it lasted a very short time.  Without any serious use, the hands just feel off!"
"So, for a cat suit, this is surprisingly baggy.  I have an athletic build but a somewhat larger chest and ordered a large so the girls weren't squished.  The shoulders and chest fit alright, but the waist was huge.  The length was fine for me at 5 7, but the garment wasn't really fitted.  I was torn on it (it is a costume after all) but didn't end up wearing it because of the fit.  It does look cheap, but it is a costume and thats just par for the course, but I did expect it to look a bit more like the material in the photo and it just doesnt.  Overall I would say that this might look okay on the right body type, but in a size large and with a waist that big, the body type it requires to fill it out probably isn't all that common."
Some lift but not much.
"Minus 2 stars for the shoe being WAY undersized. I ordered a size larger than I normally wear based on other reviewers' feedback, and I still needed another 1 to 1.5 size larger. Unfortunately I didn't have time to exchange because I was ordering this for a photoshoot. Very disappointing because I actually really liked the shoes and they seemed like they would be comfortable."
"These shoes are ok for a few hours, but I can't wear them and walk for extended periods.  They are very pretty though, and the quality is great!"
the fabric is a litttle too lightweight so it clings instead of drapesbut I still like it.
"I really wanted these to be perfect but I regret this purchase frequently. I have the taller version of these boots and I could live in them! These, however, have some serious downfalls. The height of the boot is not good, it's in between your ankle and calf. The top part of the boot fits so tight (and i have tiny ankles and chicken legs) it looks really weird with pants tucked into them and with rolled pants. The only way the top looks good is with tights. I still use them but I don't zip them up and just wear them with leggings."
"Overall I'm a huge fan of the shoe. They provide great support and fit very well. The only downfall is the fact that the inside heel started wearing within a month of use.

I'm to the point now where there is no longer any padding in a portion of the heel on both shoes."
"odd fit on ch hest and shoulders. great fabric,"
"I chose this rating since the hat is to large for my head and heavy.  The hat is a beautiful shade of red and the white trim is neat.
I found it is oversized for a woman's head and therefore doesn't look chic.  Rather heavy to wear for any amount of time."
it looks nice but not comfortable...my daughter's ankle twists when she walks fast with these
"Nice materials, but the sleeves are short and too tight, they have super skinny arm"
"Is somewhat large, very soft and comfy, I am giving it 3 stars because it started pilling after 4 times I wore them."
"Too tight on the upper part--could tell instantly they just weren't going to work. The length was fine--width, not so much.  The material would have rubbed the sides of my feet raw.  Maybe I just have a fat foot...don't have problems with other shoes though.  Had to return."
Definitely not the same quality as Under Armour Crew socks I've purchased locally but decent.
They are pretty but the color is much darker than what's shown
Did not care for these at all. The coloring was faded and quality was poor.
"It would be perfect except for the strange odor inside. I have left it outside on my balcony to air out, but so far no difference."
Cozy. But they slide off of our foot easy.
There is no buckle or stretch. I have a high instep and couldn't get my foot into it.
No spot for laptop like described. Cheaper material than my last Roxy backpack.
"Don't put this in the dryer, it shrinks up."
Another product that has to be layered. If that's what you want then this is the product for you. I haven't figured out how to get some of the factory wrinkles out of it. Washing and drying hasn't worked so far.
"Again this brand must run small....I tried the next size up but that was to long...this brand must only be made for narrow feet.
I wish they would have fit. The color is beautiful."
"Biggest drawback - The heart rate monitor does not work very well / reliably!  Sometimes it will read for me, other times it refuses to.  (I took 2 stars off since that was my primary reason for purchasing this watch.)  It doesn't matter if I adjust where it is at on my wrist or off I move it to the inside of my wrist. Charge on the watch lasts for 2 - 3 days consistently.  The watch face does tend to light up with everyday common jesters including turning the steering  wheel. Very nice being able to read an incoming text message including picture messages without pulling my phone out.  Voice response to the text message works simi ok.  I found it more work than it was worth.  I do like being able to answer/reject phone calls.  It's great for driving with older model cars.  I'm able to keep my hands on the steering wheel without having to pull my phone out. (Hands free device)  the pedometer works quite well and I get roughly the same number of steps as my Galaxy phone reads."
Liked the style but the fabric is too thin to support my 2x size.
Love the shoes but they are a very small fit so order up a size for sure
Had to return. The material was fine but listen to other reviews -- it's way too short and I'm only 5'6.
The waist i believe was okay fit but the legs way to narrow for him. He works out a lot and has issues finding relax fit that fit well.
"okay dress, it was not what I was looking for so I will return it. I'm 5'6 115 lbs and I ordered the 4/6 or small size. it was a little tight (not unbearable) the dress is very short. if you want more of a classier look (which I did) this is not the dress. Also the bottom of the dress is tighter almost like a mermaid style which is weird. I could barely move my legs"
not the best quality but ok for the price
Not as good as the Capri pants.
A little too big from me but will wear it.
"I ordered 4 JD apparel shirts in coral 2 large, 1 xlarge, and 1 xxlarge. I ordered them all from JD Apparel on the same day. The quality of the shirts are great. They are sized correctly. I would have loved to give them 5 stars. Unfortunately these were for a wedding and the xxlarge arrived in a different color. 3 were the pinkish coral pictured and the xxlarge came in the same box as a large and an xlarge but arrived in an orange coral totally different in color. If you need these in a specific color order them early just in case you need to reorder."
Super cute but very uncomfortable compared to other Chinese laundry heels I have owned
"Had to return. Also, the top is too low and digs into my ankle. Maybe just my feet though..."
"the shirt is adorable, but I received the 2T instead of 12-18 month size. Unfortunately, it's way too big for my son to wear on his first birthday."
I was hoping for a casual look. But these pants (material & color)  look more like work pants. I do like the pockets.
"These pants are really cute, but the bottom was not what I expected at all - they actually have elastic on the bottom and therefore are not wide legged the way they look in the pictures.  They're very comfy and I love the print - but I'm disappointed because I was really hoping for a wide leg flowy pant.  And also, because I am 5'11"", these fit more like capri pants than pants."
I have to stuff it with tissue paper to make it fit.
to small its made for a child
Very nice sweats.
"WHY did my black Tevas come with white soles?  The photo shows them with black soles and all my other black ones have black soles.  While they fit well, as usual, they look really tacky with the white soles.  I might have to send them back, but I'm not sure that I can replace them with a pair with black soles if the photo isn't true.  I love Tevas and literally live in them all year round, but am really disappointed with this pair."
This is a little tight in the arms and shoulders.
"Good Quality material and looks as it does in the picture.  I wish I had ordered a size smaller, but this is a good beach cover up."
"This is a very attractive, but very heavy watch.  And the weight and bulk are the main reasons I am docking its rating two stars, so maybe that's unfair so long as you understand what you are getting here.  I just can't imagine routinely wearing a watch this bulky and heavy, but I do see men who do exactly that (our last car salesman wore a similar watch and it did look nice).  Also, it has some functionality, but not really as much as a sports watch, so I still have to believe the target market for this watch is men who want a bracelet that tells time and looks sharp and don't really care that it's making their watch arm longer than the other due to the weight stretching it out (that's a joke, no extra charge).  So, I'd say if you really like the look and don't mind the bulk, give it a shot.  Otherwise, go for something lighter."
"I bought this thinking it might be big for my 11 year old daughter, but it turn out just right, maybe even slightly tight. She normally wears a size 3, and the other size 4s I have for her, she 'flaps' in! So, I would advise to get a half size up, and the Wide fitting really doesn't feel that way at all. On the whole, I am rather disappointed with New Balance for kids - I love their adults shoes, but the kids fitting and quality are not nearly as good."
Seems a little small or tight. But feels like good fabric
Package delivered on time. Product is exactly as said except it's very dark. The pic makes it look as light as silver or white Gold. This is very dark and doesn't match my white Gold engagement ring. I'm keeping anyway because it'll work for now but once we get our white Gold bands I'm tossing this one. It's definitely good for the price.
This is a very big size 4 sandals. It fits like an adult size 6 so if you have small feet be careful. I would say apart form that it is a cute sandal
"Nice looking shoe but imcorrectly sized. I bought my normal size shoe and had to add an additional insole before I could wear the shoe without it falling off. If you buy this shoe, buy half size smaller than usual"
I'd rather have it altered that to send it back.
"I ordered this RFID-blocking billfold out of concern of having my cards ""cloned"" while still being in my pocket.
The wallet appears to be well-made, and for me it's impossible to know if It really offers the protection claimed.
The wallet is thicker than my regular, plain billfold, without the two plastic ""windows"" my regular wallet has. Being thicker, I will have to carry fewer items in my new wallet, or it will ruin the back pockets of my casual and dress trousers.
In any case, it was not too expensive........I guess I'll get used to it."
Just buy women's underwear. These are super sexy but fit a little small. And after two washes they tear up. You can get 12 pairs of women's underwear for this same price and they are meant to be worn and washed regularly.
"Cute and darling, but run very small. Had to give them to my daughter! She thinks she looks like Taylor Swift now!"
A bit tight and short. Order bigger than normal.
"I wish the Beenie was a bit larger. I would like to order more of the caps, but I don't want them fitting so snug like the Beenie. Is the knit cap larger?"
We bought this because he liked the shirts at Fred Myer but they were selling for $40 which was stupid.  Half the price here but of course we forgot that we usually by Big and Tall XXL.  Still okay.
"I was disapointed I could not tighten these up more, since there is a velcro adjustment. I can still wear them, but it's not as comfortable of a fit as I would have liked"
the straps slide down but I like the material it is very comfortable
Not as useful as the advert made them out to be. One bag is totally useless but the others are ok. Just ok.
"Comfortable and good support on hard floors. I have a black pair that has been great, but the red got a size bigger after a couple of wearings. OK with $20 inserts, but that adds to the cost."
"Ok these boots are hot. Like putting them on and looking at them, im just in love. HOWEVER, they are extremely uncomfortable. Within a half hour i want to rip them off. Maybe size up? I am a true 7.5 and i bought 8s to see and they still hurt and were sliding off. Im stubborn and im not returning the 7.5s, but BEWARE. They might suck."
"Sleeves are really saggy, fabric is kind of itchy but it looks like the picture."
I love these pajamas but they do shrink in the dryer.
"It's comfortable and smooths nicely under a dress, but not firm enough to pull in the tummy."
I liked this corset however I ordered a Small and received a medium and it's ok quality. It still fit okay but a little bigger than expected since I received the wrong size. The fabric on the top halter area is very thin and stretches easily. I bought this item at a discount in exchange for a review and I don't think I would buy from them again.
"Color is not olive, it's LIME GREEN. I kept it because it fit my frame well. I will only be wearing it on special occasions."
"Necklace is very cheaply made, and is definitely not worth the ""retail price"" of $24.99. But for this listing price, it is nice enough for the small charity auction I am donating it to. Arrived in a black velvet bag, not a pink gift box."
"I bought 3 of these and one showed up broken, this one is the one i'm replacing it with, not real happy with this."
First time buying online so maybe I jut didn't know my size but it was pretty tight. My head barely fit
The size runs very small. The material in the front is very shiny and looks cheap. the dress is worth $30  but it also looks cheap. I am returning because of the size and quality.
Switched to American Eagle underwear made from a similar material.  They are more comfortable and seem to hold up a lot better after going through the washing machine a bunch.
I liked it but the stone is crooked.dont like that.
Very nice material.  It ran really small thru the shoulder area and is a little tight.  But over all a very nice shirt.
Can not open wallet if you choose to wear on your belt. Good quality leather. Not worth $35! Would not buy again or as a gift.
"warmth is good ..material is good ..but runs small..i gave it to my son ,,he wears a one size smaller than me..order a size up and you will be fine ."
"Beautiful watch, but the cronograph does not works well.. i hoped a better watch.."
"The shoe fits pretty good. I ordered a 13 and it seems a little short, but that is OK.
The shoe provides the basic support and gets good traction. The one thing I do not like, and a big factor, the in-sole is not comfortable. There is no cushion or arch support. I used an insert and now it feels much better.
I got a ""deal"" price, the deal price was lost by having to purchase the inserts."
"I bought this to replace a worn out front-pocket wallet I have had for about 3 years.  I received this, and while it is nicely crafted, it is way to small to be functional for me.  My biggest issue was with cash storage.  The billfold area isn't deep enough for the paper bills to sit all the way down (doesn't matter if you use 1 bill or 10).  No matter what I tried, the long edge of the paper bills would stick out up to 3/16 of an inch outside of this wallet.  That made no sense to me, so I returned it for something a little bigger."
"Can't review shoe yet, since my normal size was a very tight fit.  I ordered a 12 and exchanging for a 13..just a heads up for anyone considering this shoe."
"These toddler sandals are indeed so cute and my daughter likes them but I wish the sizing was better. And I would say the comfort level is probably a medium for her. She currently wears a size 9 (and some normal nines are even a tad long and loose on her still)... but I bought a size 9/10 in these and her toes hang off of the sandals, as you can see in the pictures I attached. Yes, maybe she can get a few more wears from them at least but still, I'm worries she is going to stub her toes somewhere because of this sizing issue. The ankle strap is on the looser side so I imagine if I went up to a size 11/12 for her to fit better in length then the ankle strap would be way too loose on her foot. Beside this issue they are really cute and I like the butterfly on this blue pair. At least I did receive these at a slightly discounted price in exchange for my honest review. So, I do hope you find this review helpful in your purchasing decisions as well. :)"
"Ordered in white for a costume, it fit well but was a little thin and see threw"
"They run small.  Love the green color.  How often do you get a color like this in a bootie?  Overall, I love Miz Mooz, but the 2013 Fall/Winter lineup sizing was definitely way off on many styles."
I love the color and the soft cotton. The lace was ripped when I got it .The sleeves are tight and body is loose. I kept it anyway just for lounging around the house. If I would of see it in the store I would not buy it .
The sandals looks well and fit well but are not comfortable. The sole of the shoes are to hard and it's difficult to walk with them.
Daughter did not like.  Bought dress for her.
"The lenses arrived on time and were packaged well in a nice compartmentalized box for easy storage in my car. I rated the product ok because I bought them to reduce headlight glare, or 'eyelashes' from oncoming headlights. These glasses do brighten the night but they don't reduce or minimize the glare. Instead white lights are shaded yellow. I don't plan to return them because I do find them useful, but not for my initial problem."
"It did the job well, but this glue is very thick and difficult to spread.  Next time I'll use contact cement."
sleeves not long enough
"My daughter loves this nightgown because it is super cute.  Unfortunately even with washing it on delicate and hanging it to dry, some of the tulle came loose and had to be mended.  I ordered up one size for her and it fits perfect."
wear fast on the heel
"I love almost everything about this dress except for the bust. I am 5ft 5, about a size 16 and I have a 38 DDD. While the rest of the dress fit wonderfully, my boobs were falling out of the bust. Unfortunately if I had gotten the dress any bigger (I think I ordered the biggest size, however), it would have fit my bust and been like a tent around the rest of my body. Needless to say, this is a gorgeous dress, the material is beautiful and comfortable... But if you are a DD or bigger I wouldn't bother unless you are using it as a bathing suit cover up. Because it doesn't cover up much else."
its not as pretty as the pictures but its nice.
These look great and I get a ton of compliments. BUT they're very uncomfortable.
Killed my feet. didn't fit like the ones in the store.
"The Duet Skimmer fits a bit more snug than most of the Crocs I buy.  It's tight across the top of my arch but not uncomfortably so, and I think it will stretch out a little over time.  I bought my usual size and my toes are right up against the rubber bumper on the front.  The material is nice and stretchy and the footbed is comfortable."
"First it's not shiny as the picture,
The material is just normal, not for luxury ware
If you are this..this won't be tight,  little loose
It's would be good to complete halloween costume,
If you match it with elegant evening dress..maybe it's wouldn't be much great as you like"
I ordered according to the scale shown and this is tight. I wore it a few minutes and cut the tags but then it started feeling snug. Before long it became too tight to wear. The scale from Bali is not correct for everyone so be aware of this when you order. I used the last hook and it is still not comfortable. Consider the extension/hooks when you order just encase it does not fit just right. Prefer to return but already cut tags. Pretty bra.
"Nice fit, don't like color to much."
"I just finished the whole bottle. I can't really say I hate it, but can't fall in love with it either. It is a thick, heavy serum. Once applied on the face, it takes some time for it to sink in (or dry up), and it leaves a sticky feeling on the face. I was using a face oil when started this serum, and had to give up the oil to try out the serum. However, this product is somewhat picky to use with other moisturizers because of its sticky texture (maybe because it's made with real juice as how the label claims!!)

The best thing about it was that it didn't make my face worse than how it was, but my acne problem wasn't clearly improved. So if anyone can forgo the stickiness that this serum leaves on the skin, it can be an ok choice as it doesnt dry out the skin."
Material is so nice. I kept the pants. But the top was too large for me. Ordered a medium. I am in between a med and a small. But medium was too big
"I'm 5'5"" 130lbs and it was a little loose all around.  Did not flatter me at all. It was also a few inches from the ground and I prefer my maxi dresses to be touching when I'm bare foot."
"Bought them for my son, they seem on the large side.  Maybe it's just his feet.  But either way they are fairly durable."
It looks nice but was not quite as roomy for what I needed it for.  I found another bag for that and used this one for something else.  It does have a smell to it which I don't care for but is not so overpowering that I cannot use it.  I do with it zipped all the way but it is short about an inch.
"I usually order 6.5 shoe size.  This item is about half size smaller. Width is a little narrow, I wear normal. Unable to wear two socks due to size. I work in the deli cooler, which I get super cold feet."
Strong Oder and not packaged in the box.
"These boots are way too big. I wear a 12 in most shoes and boots but I am swimming in these. When I walk in them, they feel very loose and I feel like I'm going to trip over my own feet. I recommend getting at least a half size smaller than usual."
"Don't understand why the 550 relaxed fit jean size varies between colors.  Rinse 38x30 fits as expected, Dark Stonewash 38x30 waist is too small."
"The boot stretchers are great... made out of wood but second application on my boot, the plastic broke that stretches the width of the foot.  It comes in pairs and I only needed one so I have been extra careful not to break the other one.  That part is very weak while the other parts are excellent quality."
The shoes are very stiff and a little on the small side.  High quality materials and great sole.
It's ok. The superman symbol is MUCH less prominent than pictured.
"To small for a plus size . Very sheer in bra area. Used as a gift. she loved it,"
OMG...THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL SHOE... BUT IT RUNS HALF SIZE TOO SMALL.  I CAN NOT WEAR SOCK WITH THIS SHOE. ORDER ONE SIZE BIGGER.  I WILL TEST OUT THIS SHOW WITH NO SOCKS ON AND SEE IF I MAKE IT THROUGH OUT THE DAY AT WORK.  I HOPE THIS SHOE PASS THE TEST;
"See through material, otherwise great. Finctioned exactly as needed under my vest for my wedding. Love the black link buttons!"
"I returned these jeans.. They did fit but were not comfortable on me. I think looked pretty nice, but just not the right fit for me. The return process was super easy.. so I like that:)
I think Jeans are just tough to buy without trying on.. at least for me."
"very nice dress, had got this for my daughter, if you have large breast you may want to get two sizes larger even if your small on the bottom. I really"
"It seems a nice sneaker, but I wore today and it bothered my left foot a lot.  The sneaker it is narrow.  I don't have a wide foot, neither narrow.  I will have to buy another one."
"While I liked the SPF25 of this moisturizer, I didn't like the way if seemed to sit on the surface of my skin.  This gave my face a whitish cast and it ""pilled"" when I tried to rub it in.  That means when I tried to rub this product in, it would actually rub off instead leaving what looks like the residue left over when you use an old fashioned eraser all over my skin.  This residue had to be brushed off which, in turn, tended to create even more residue.  This also left residue and white streaks all around my neck by the end of the day.  I would not purchase this product again.

Update: I ran out of my regular sunscreen and, in a pinch, had to make this one work.  I found that when this product is used alone, as in clean, dry, naked skin without any serums, primers, anti-wrinkle cream, make-up, etc, that it didn't pill and it was much easier to rub in.  Being able to rub it in well also eliminated the whitish cast that it previously left on my skin.

So, if you are at an age where you can get by with just a moisturizer, then this sun screen would be worth a try because, as sun screens go, it's pretty moisturizing.  However, if you need to layer products to address other skin issues then this isn't the sun screen for you.  Maybe someday they will make a moisturizing sun screen like this that does ""play well with other products"" or that is a multi-tasker, eliminating the need to slather on so many products.  Until then,  this is better suited to younger skin.  And, if you need to use acne products you younger folks might run into the same pilling issues when you try and layer the two.

I've  since been using up my bottle on my hands.  Does a good job.  My hands definitely look better and feel softer and the high SPF is helping to prevent future age spots."
Love the shirt but it runs small! I would order one size larger to be safe.
"I like the retro design. The cotton has a slightly rough feel, so these are not what I hoped they would be. All of them have been through the wash several times, but they have not softened significantly."
"I wish I was small and thin.  I'm just a regular sized woman.  5'5""  140lbs.
The clothes are cute and very inexpensive.
But they are made for smaller and thinner girls.  with a AA bra size.
I think that they should be in the JR category.  for girls not women.
Will give this one away to my tiny 5' tall girlfriend.
sigh."
"It should be said that this ""letterman jacket"" is basically fleece in its entirety. Unlike a traditional letterman jacket the sleeves are not leather, or even a faux leather. Otherwise, it is a nice quality and feels good. I would not purchase this again. This is not a letterman jacket."
"It was too small. I bought the 24"" chain and it was only 20"" ! Very disappointed.  Bought for my daughters birthday."
Loved the last pair. I wore them out. This pair is not made of the same material.  They are stiff and left one is quite tight. Disappointed.
After only few months starting to wear off
"Look good at first but shrink every time that you wash and dry them. I am now wearing them as ""hand me downs"" and I am a petite xs."
Adorable sneaker but a full size too small. Size up and you're good to go.
"Got my beautiful new mocs and I am seriously bummed, I have a pair of Jungle Mocs in tan pigsuede, size 6.5 that fits me perfectly.  I wanted a pair in smooth leather, and I ordered the 6.5 Lavish in Midnight.  The shoe is beautiful, but it is too narrow and too short. Why the gross size difference?

I went to exchange them and find that the price has gone up 20 bucks - I wasn't offered an even exchange.  Back they go.  I really needed these to work.  I have no choice but to order online. They are still $80 at the competitor's site, and that one allows me 365 days for returns.  I'm overseas and it takes forever to send things."
"Should have read up on them better, my fault, no pockets*"
That material is stiff and took numerous washings to improve.  They aren't bad but they're not great.
"I wear a size 10-10.5. These boots fit great for foot length but the shaft was very big.  My calves are slightly over 16"" and these boot were much too wide.  They would probably be great for someone with 19"" calves."
"pockets were uneven; one high, one low.  It is cute but I wish they were the same."
"Shorter than pictured. More like a crop jacket than a regular one, and I'm short. Can't imagine what it would be on a normal sized person"
"Traction is too grippy for dance. The yellow band was cutting into my toes. The flexibility and light weight would have been good for dance, if the other problems were not there."
"loved the color and the feel of the material, but the neck is not very ""V'ed"", and it was tighter across my middle than I expected from the photo."
This was a gift so I can not answer
Didn't realize they were hip-huggers and didn't work for my sister.
Should have fit but did not
"The sandals are a little heavy, not very flexible to walk in for very long."
Plastic beads joined together no string between them it looks like a mold was used. I bought it off a friend's wish list and if I am this disappointed with the bracelet I can only imagine she will be too.
"loved it online, but the skirt is surprisingly short."
"Beware of knock off. See pictures for variations (print on inside of shoe, wrapping paper, and underside of lid) between authentic and knock off versions.

Size varies slightly per shoe due to shoes being handmade.

Size 6.5 fits well in authentic black pair and 6.5 fits looser in authentic brown pair.  I am normally purchasing other shoes in a size 7 which gives me plenty of toe room and does not flip off my feet.  I am 30 weeks pregnant and the black and brown are not true to size (6.5M per the provided sizing guide given the length of my feet in inches). Prior to ordering I pulled out the ruler and measured my feet and selected my size per the provided sizing guide.  Visibly, the authentic 6.5 brown pair had a sharper taper at the toe than the authentic 6.5 black pair. This sharper taper makes the brown pair a bit looser.  The authentic 6.5 black pair fits more comfortably than the authentic 6.5 brown pair. I GENTLY tightened the bow on the authentic 6.5 brown pair and it fits a bit more snug.  I tightened the bow on the authentic 6.5 brown pair because it was loose on the insides and outsides of my feet.  This caused large gaps between the shoes and my feet.  Tightening the bow brought the sides of the shoe closer to my feet and was an acceptable fit.  I did order a half size smaller in an authentic brown, a size 6, to compare the fit. The 6.5 authentic brown will work while I am pregnant with swollen feet, but the authentic 6 brown will work better after pregnancy and my feet aren't swollen.

As far as comfort these feel nice. I am unable to add inserts to accommodate my heel pain, but that's okay. They do not rub my feet to cause blisters and I love the style.  I'd definitely recommend these to other pregnant soon to be mamas with a warning to check for authenticity."
"I have a pair of New Balance shoes that I love, so I ordered the same size.  These were much to large for me.  They didn't have the support that I need, so I tried them with my inserts.  They were still to large.  It was very disappointing because I really need a pair of black athletic shoes for a performance group I belong to.  Overall, they are good shoes for someone who doesn't have a need for a shoe that provides support.  I would not recommend them for athletes."
They are much smaller than I thought they would be. They are the same size as the children's earrings that I bought.
"This is a great item however I do a lot of walking and find the rubber soles will crack after a short period of time.  The comfort is there, the shoe I believe is made of good quality it would be nice if the rubber soles lasted longer."
"This is a nice looking scarf, but the lint it leaves on any type of shirt is awful. I made the mistake of wearing it over a black cotton shirt, and it looked like I'd had a hairy dog sleeping on my chest... The lint was really hard to get off of my clothing."
"My girlfriend says I look pretty sexy in them but I feel bare and as good as naked. I personally don't like that but that's just my preference. If you have great bod that you WANT to show off (unlike me) go for it.

In addition, this outfit is really thin and elastic."
"The only down fall these shoes have is the fact that the liners are made out of tiny bumps. They are met to be comfortable but after a few hours of walking they feel like tiny knives going into your feet with every step. great if your not going to walk much or if you only need them for like 45 minutes of walking past that they are just awful. I had to replaced the liners, to fix to the problem."
"Very cute, but a bit smaller than expected."
"Cute shirt, nice fabric and print but I had to return it because it was too large. I am 5'4"" 130 lbs and ordered a small. I normally would exchange for another size but it was much longer than the shirt in the photo and I didn't think a size smaller would fix that."
"Grey was not very attractive on, but I kept the black one in the same style.  I gave it 3 stars only because the fabric is a bit thicker than expected (polyester) and not really good for summer."
we returned them as my son found them uncomfortable
"Little more space than I wanted I like my shoes not so roomy. End metal pieces on the shoelaces are annoying, laces come undone more often. Not cushioned at all and really flat. Cheap."
Okay so I ordered these in a few colors word to the wise they all fit different some fit fine and drapes as expected but some fall back behind my sides like it want to drape behind me....... Not even sure how to describe it... Maybe order a size up?? If you want it to fit like an actual cardigan they are soft and vibrant. I ordered a medium.  I'm 5'9 140lbs it comes below my bum.
"Very cute shoes, however they do not fit like other Dansko. They have more of a curve to them, did not form to my feet well. I have osteoarthrits in my great toes and these were painful for me to walk it. The Dansko Professionals are a much better shoe for me."
Very nice boots but could not zip up
"I was expecting this to be more like a dress, since that's what the description says... but it's actually a shirt with a tulle ""tutu"" attached.  It's too short to be worn as a dress.  Looks very cute with pink leggings like in the photo, though!  Part of the tulle tutu was sewn to itself, so I had to carefully pull it apart.  This left a little snag on the tutu, but it's barely noticeable.  Overall, I am mostly happy with this item.  It looks adorable on my daughter, who wears between a size 5-6.
I was also hoping the barrette that was included would be a Peppa Pig barrette, but it was actually a knock-off Hello Kitty barrette."
"They look great, very substantial materials but they're going back. They are pretty much shapeless even with the strap behind the heel."
I ordered three different belts like this at the sqme time....this one cane in 2nd. Cheap and ok....just ok. Wolf tactical is MUCH Better.
"They were ok, but I didn't like the way they looked bunched up on the heel when I walked. I sent them back cause they weren't really my cup of tea."
"I actually ended up ordering a bigger and wider size. My daughter wears a size 6 shoe, but the ballet shoes were way too small to wear comfortably. Super cute and seem to be high quality."
"Rides up from my hips to my waist with any real movement, i.e. running, dancing. The color is accurate to the screen. It's okay for walking, but even then I have to keep pulling it down - an annoying distraction. I have a pear/large hourglass shape, so maybe that's part of it, but I won't be buying another one."
"too weird looking, and didn't stay in place"
"I really wanted to LOVE these shoes, but the band across the toes are just too tight, thus they were returned."
Did not look like the pick and following their size chart these were way too big.
it's too large in my regular size
"My daughter wanted a HP wand for Xmas, but you know how kids are.  They grow out of stuff so quickly that I didn't want to spend $35 on the other wands I found.  Then I found this guy.  It was cheap so I bought it.  The picture doesn't do this thing justice.  It looks like someone took a long, thin poop and shaped a wand out of it.  It's hollow plastic too, so it got torn up almost immediately.  Luckily I was right.  My daughter grew out of her HP phase, but if your kid is a huge HP lover, spring for the more expensive options.  They're WAY better."
Would order two sizes smaller then what you think
"Shirt was way too large. I purchased a size L; I am 5'-9"" 190 lbs, and the shirt swam on me, and was way too big. The material was thinner than I expected, but seemed to be quite warm. I returned the item to Amazon due to the size."
"Overall, I paid a decent price for a set of knee high socks. I wish they had been bigger to accommodate larger thighs, as soon as the sock goes over the knee it begins to roll down. I would also like to suggest anyone interesting in purchasing the product go with a solid color or variety pack as the nonstop red and black stripes made me feel as though I was constantly getting dressed to work in Hot Topic."
fabric is hard
"I had high hopes for this headband, but it slides off of my head constantly, and I'm having to fix it throughout the day. I love the color, but this isn't the best material."
The wig was a great price but I am very disappointed in the color. I bought this for a poison ivy cosplay as it appeared it was a deeper red and when I got the wig it was more of a Ariel the mermaid red.
Color has faded a lot. seems to be wearing thin quickly
A lil too tight.
"Didn't fit as expected...a little too small. I think this is the one w/the European sizes? When you look at the sizing chart, whatever size slot you fit into, I recommend going one or two sizes bigger."
I bought the incorrect size-thinking a XL would be best but have ordered a large to get something a little smaller.
Waist needed to be 37 vs 36; otherwise ok!
"I was so excited to get this bag, but it unfortunately did not meet my needs at all. The shape and style are very cute and I immediately threw the short strap over my shoulder and looked in the mirror. As cute as I hoped! The bag is not too large or cumbersome, but has tons of room inside. Now for the issues: I started transferring things from my previous bag, and nothing fit quite right! The top of the bag is so much more narrow than the bottom that as things sunk into the main compartment, the bag became misshapen and more difficult to zip. Then the cute shoulder strap would not stay out of my way to fix the placement of things inside. If you are not wanting to carry a 32 oz or larger water bottle and a tablet, this bag will probably work for you, but it didn't for me. I sent it back and got a different haiku bag with a shape that works more for me. Love haiku and their high quality, cute bags!"
Not my favorite FitFlops. I'm hoping they will stretch out around the opening because right now they hurt the top of my foot. The toe box is very room. The sole is not as cushy as my FitFlop sandals so I can't wear them for very long.
it wasn't as comfortable as the other reviewers posted.
They are a size to big and very wide and heavy.will keep feet dry.
"Very cute, in the box!  Flimsy, does not hold shape."
"Love these shoes.  So chic and timeless for the right occasion.  However, they run narrow.  My foot is somewhat normal but leans toward being wide.  Loved the color.  Wish I had been able to keep and wear them."
I have now ordered two Hot Leathers shirts and had to return them both.  I normally wear about a Large... You have to order two or even three sizes up for these shirts to fit.  Great shirt... but runs really small.
"Like the hat, but it keeps slipping up off my head!"
"the shirt fits my 3.5 year old right now, but the undies won't fit for probably another 2 years... weird match up."
"The boot leather felt thin, the straps across the top flapped loosely and seemed as if they would easily catch on various obstacles.  Boot fit was loose in length and super tight in width.  I do have a wide foot, but order a 1/2 size larger boot which usually compensates.  In this case, it did not.  These boots were very stylish, however."
"Not the best, however for $15 they were worth it"
It was really beautiful but it was so small when it got here I was shocked. And now my 10 year old granddaughter loves it thank you
"love the fit, seems like fabric starting to fall apart.  I currently use the bare naked and i like its fabric durability better but i like this fit better.  the inner thigh area on this product is coming apart  been about 5 washes)  comfort level is best i have EVER had. i only bought 1 pair to test. agian i already use a similar top quality underwear and heard about this one so wanted to try. i will not be switching over. even though the fit is amazing the durability has me concerned."
A little different from what I expected but it's still a good item.
It hurts the toes! It should have been wider .
"Cut the back of my ankle. Left foot only
Add some insoles to boots and they are great. Comfy boots and no more cuts on back of ankle"
I have the pants and long sleeve version of these and I love them. I am not happy with these. These seem to run large. The hem on the shorts make them feel bulky in between my thighs. Id say this would be a problem for anyone without a gap between their thighs. Im returning them. The quality is great though.
"Fits well, comfortable, material is quite thin though"
"The outside of these boxers is nice and slick and silky. The inside, however is much rougher and not what I was hoping for. They fit well. The patterns remind me of my dad's tie collection."
"Gorgeous color, but much, larger than I had envisioned. I gave it to a dear friend of mine who likes big purses. I cannot see wearing this across my body at all. It's much too large for that."
Same as Walmart
"Much smaller than expected, fit my 1 year old ok but was purchased for 4 year old who wore it like a baseball cap, no way the face part could come down like it is supposed to"
"The underneath is a bit short but the lace flows past that perfectly. You will definitely need a slip because the bottom is definitely see through but its very pretty, similar to the picture bit not exact"
"These shoes are not red! I ordered red patent and it is more like burgundy brown. So I cant use them for what I wanted because I needed red. I will keep them in case I need a burgundy brown shoe. I don't recommend the red. They fit ok. Also not sure if they are new, they have some marks on them. Just disappointed about the color."
Ok quality but WAY too narrow
"Instantly became my favorite shoes!  No breaking in at all and instant comfort.  They were the only shoes I brought to Honolulu and wore them for 5 days straight, and my feet were happy!  I love the fact that they are closed toed shoes but I do not feel hot or sweaty in them.  I did however add an Aldo terry cloth insole to them, so my feet would not stick to the footbed, and adds a little more cushioning.  The best part is the outsole, which is fabulous for walking on any type of terrain, as it has a lot of grip, and is super sturdy.  If you're traveling in warmer climate and can only bring one pair of shoes, these are it!  The reason I'm only giving them 4* instead of 5 is because the memory foam footbed compacts down pretty quickly and does not rebound after the first 2 wearings, making the front much more roomy (maybe even too roomy if you have a thinner foot).  I wish they would mix some other types of cushioning in addition to the memory foam layer for a more sustained cushion.

Update: May 6, 2017.  The memory foam has really packed down to almost non existence, and for the first time I was very uncomfortable walking in them, as the front is so loose and the heel has almost no padding.  So I've added a heel pad and it is feeling a lot more comfy now.  Will be adding a pad for the front too and see if it will help.  There is no excuse for using inferior foam in such an expensive shoe, as the cushioning in all my other shoes are still going strong after way more wearings.  Therefore I've deducted a star*

I hope you found my review helpful. If so, I would greatly appreciate it if you would click the HELPFUL or YES button. Thanks so much and Happy Shopping! :)"
"This particular veronica boot (slouch boot black) was VERY slouchy - the upper leather was really different from the lower leather. Product says to order half size up - so I did, but the boot felt a little too big. I have also tried on the veronica in the stone wash - which does run small, and the leather is stiffer. I think that each style of veronica boots fits and wears differently so not all reviews can apply to all styles. Ultimately this was a nice boot - I was just looking for something a little tougher."
did not fit the chest.
Fit a bit tighter than I expected however a good sandal around the house.
"I am a true size 7 so I ordered a 7 since there is no 7.5 and they are barely just too small. A 7.5 would be plenty more room for me and an 8 too large. Other than the sizing malfunction of the brand the quality and style are otherwise great, but haven't been able to wear them to see how they hold up in the rain or how comfortable they would be."
Bought this for a gift. Nice purse but the color was way off compared to what the picture showed. Try to find the color you want at the store first then order over the internet. Would recommend.
Does not look like picture. Is not a shiny finish at all.
"I loved the size and design; however, I ended up returning this item, for I no longer needed it and it seemed cheap."
"Damn tight. For some reason we continue to think we look like the models shown in the pictures, which is wrong. We look like ourselves, squeezed into tight jeans."
"This bag is cute! However, I would reconsider my purchase because of the price of the bag. The bag is smaller then what I thought it would be; I don't think it's worth $29. It's a fine size because we were using it for a newborn girl but I don't see being able to fit a lot in it for an older child of 5 or so."
"I've been ordering the same Under Armour Charged Cotton men's white crew socks for years.  Sadly, it is clear that the quality of these socks is getting increasingly worse over time - not as thick as they've been previously which means they won't be as comfortable and won't last nearly as long - very disappointing.  I'm going to have to shop for other brands in the future."
not comfy but good support
"I saw this shoe in a store and immediately went to Amazon to try it. First, I ordered an 8.5 and they sent me an 8, which was disappointing. The 8 was just too small. I usually wear an 8 to 8.5 and with pumps I always start with the 8 first. But with Amazon, returns are easy and free, and I was able to get the 8.5 the next day! Unfortunately, I have a narrow heel and the 8.5 slipped off my heel. Otherwise, it fit perfectly and was very comfortable. I might order the sister pair with the straps that hold the shoe on. If you have medium width feet all the way then this shoe will probably fit perfectly!"
The wigth is a little snug.
"I bought these to wear with my flats and heels.  They still show in my shoes ( I bought these so my socks wouldn't show!).  I wear a shoe size 7, so I bought the small/medium.  They fit great and stay up due to the rubber adhesive thing at the back of the liner.  I'll still wear them, even if they show as it doesn't bother me much, but next time, I'll make sure to order a smaller size to make sure the liner does disappear."
"Looks good. Not worth the 450 they say
is the regular price. Worth about 100- that
is about what I paid. Dials hard to set- lugs to set dial do not work very well. Three star rating based mainly on the look of the watch."
Pants are cut to fit very well.  The only down side to these pants are they are very thin.  I do not see these pants lasting nearly as long as other pants I have bought in the past.
"Not really made for postpartum bodies. In 5'7"" and 185lbs post baby. I purchased an XL and I had to squeeze into this top. It wasn't comfortable and it rode up my belly when I walked. It is long, it's practically a dress."
"Five dollars cheaper than the comparable Eagle Creek product .
The Pacsafe belt has more rugged zippers and a zip pocket that
is 8 inches longer.  More for less.  However both belts share the
same clasp mechanism with is vastly inferior to that on an older
Eagle Creek money belt of mine.  It will not stay buckled if there
is any outward pressure.  Any tightening of the gut, ... say when
you are hoisting your pack, and the buckle unclasps.  Not much
of a belt.  Obviously the engineers never tried their redesign."

It has adequate strength to protect a pair of eyeglasses. Certainly more protection than a sleeve or soft case. It is not indestructible though so if you are the type to step or sit on your glasses, then this case may not be quite enough protection.

The case is small. It will only fit a pair of narrow readers (small to medium), like the type that you wear at the end of your nose. The magnet closure is nice, but it will not close if your glasses are too big. The material the case is made out of is like a synthetic cross between suede and velvet. On the inside, it will protect your glasses from getting scratch. However, the same material on the outside seems to gather some dust pretty easily. I think a leatherette or other smooth type material would have been better on the outside of the glasses case."
It's ok for t he price.  the Leather started to crack and peal right away.
"Loved my NB 846s, but thought I'd try this one.  It looks clunky, so I don't care for that, but it seems a good fit for my foot with medium toe box, narrow heel, very high arch and super flexible.  I also have Morton's Neuromas and they don't bother me in NB shoes--the 928 included.  My other complaint is the tongue is narrower and the corners of the tongue hit the front of my ankle in a spot between tendons--not  comfy.  I'm hoping it ""breaks"" in better, but I never had to break in the 846s."
"The white is see through, like sheer tights or nylons. Even nude underwear are visible through these. My daughter will have to wear these under a skirt, not alone ."
not fond of this stretch material.  The shirt is very snug fitting and I like my clothes looser.
"I loved the boot, so sad it did not fit, I thought it would because of the laces in the back looked promising. However there is no stretch to give on the material of the boot, it did not even pass my calf. This is perfect for those with very slender legs. Sadly I returned back and will continue my search for knee high boots that will have more give to their fabric."
In all honesty I haven't been able to wear it too often. When all three pieces are on it's difficult to move around/sit down (pretty confining). The directions say do not put directly on skin so I can't wear it out to put under clothing. When I do have on it holds everything in.
"The ankle strap even on the tightest loop is a little loose and the backs of my ankles get a little scraped if I wear these all day, but other than that they're adorable and durable!"
"was smaller then I expected and I thought it had a chain.
Over all it looked nice I guess.
I gave it to my youngest and She had a chain that She put it on"
"Love the colors, but the hat looks stupid on me.  There's no way to sugar coat it - just looks dumb.  I would send it back, but then I'd have paid more in shipping than I did for the hat itself.  Also, leave a ton of static in my hair.  Warm though, and fun."
"Runs small and narrow. This is a 9-Wide; my size is 8.5 Regular. That is what I got first, and had to send it back, exchanging for a 1/2 larger size, wide hiking shoes. The only reason I got this brand again, because I like the design, and it is a dark color.
I have several other Keen hiking shoes, they fit perfectly, and I wear them all day for work (I am running around 9 hours/day in a grocery store)."
"The boots appeared to be good quality but they ran narrow.  I wear a 7.5 med width shoe and these were not going to allow for enough room for a good wool hiking sock and still be comfortable.  Every boot needs a break in period, and I really wanted to love these, but the fit was just not good for me personally. If you have a slightly narrow foot - you may find them to be better for you. With Amazon's easy returns its worth a try."
"I chose the rating because the shirt is a little thin, however I notice that much of the junior sized clothing these days
are thin. My Grand-daughter loves the shirt, so that makes me happy. She does wear a tee underneath it however."
Moderately uncomfortable
"I love these! But even being very careful with care, washing by hand, hand drying..., as I read the reviews... still, the fabric came opened at the seems... poor quality, but comfy and cute. Don't expect to use these for a long time, they are a bit disposable,."
A TAD SMALL FOR THE SIZE BOUGHT!
"I'm a half size and purchased the size the site recommended. It was a smidge too small for my foot, and since I had also purchased the All Out Blaze Sieve, I went with that instead."
They were a bit scuffed
"This could have been a very comfortable, stylish sandal, but the straps are much to large for a normal foot.  The toe loop was extremely large...someone with a plump foot would benefit from these sandals.  The other straps were also loose, and even on the last notch, my foot tended to slip all over the place.  The length was perfect in my usual size, but unless you have a hefty foot, the straps likely will be too big!"
"Cool shirt but, for a large, it fits like a small. The quality is poor and there was a hole on the side. It was a Christmas gift so I made it work by stitching it up myself. :( My boyfriend loves it or he really loves me because he didn't complain. lol I'd buy it again once they add an extra layer of fabric."
"I've only worn this once, but I couldn't wait to take it off when I got home. Maybe it just needs to break in, but the fabric rubbed a bit and was somewhat uncomfortable. I will try adjusting it, I guess. The color/pattern is pretty, though, and the price was good."
Nice long wig. Sadly it tangles easily.  I paid for express shipping and it came a day late. Don't think I will buy again.
A beautiful shoe but very high heeled.
I like the charm it's delicate looking but disappointed the charm will not fit on my sterling necklace. I will now have to buy a new chain in order to wear this charm. I wouldn't have purchased the charm had I know it would not fit on my necklace.
Hoped for a somewhat looser fit- to fit sweater underneath
"This is super cute and I like it ... its shorter than I thought it would be and not quite tight enough yet not quite lose. Outs a little tricky getting ALL the hooks done.i struggle giving it 3 stars, it's a decent piece though.
NOTE TO SELF: pay attention to the direction of the ribbon when leaving it; top to bottom!"
Huge huge huge. Could have fit three people in this robe.  Sent back for refund. Was very sad because it was well made.
"Great shoes but the zipper broke after 2 months, the sole is also very week and the tongue always moves to the back of my foot"
"This is a pretty piece.  After I got it, I decided the chain, even at 19"" was too short for me.  I gifted it to a friend and she loves it.  Looks good on any shade of blue or green."
"cute, but somewhat small."
"I give it 3 stars bc it fits too small. If it had fit I would of rated it 5 stars. I love the cut and design just sad that the medium fit like an extra small. So, I will return it for an extra large to get my desired fit."
a little loose around the legs will not buy again
"I purchased this item hoping for a standard, onesie-type top.  It's unfortunately extremely thin and see-through.  It's very soft, and I appreciate the eco-friendly bamboo materials, but it won't work as a stand-alone top.  However, It might work for you if you need a thin layer under sweaters or other tops."
"These are cute, but they ran large on the front of the foot and front is not adjustable."
"the glows is amazing when the light of the sun hits them, i really don't like it"
"They're cute, but I can't wear them long, they make my ears itch."
I bought this chain and intended to use to put some pearl beads on but it was just to dainty.  While I was not overly thrilled with it I decided to keep it and just wear it by itself without anything on it.
"Based on reviews I bought a size too big, and should have just bought my size. They are as described, but I was envisioning something less... polyester-ey. The fabric is a thin, 1970s style polyester jersey. I was thinking they'd be kind of funky and retro, but they're just not something I would wear in public. My daughter in law said they're fine for lounging around watching tv, and they're comfortable enough.  I guess for the price they're fine but I won't buy more.  Sweatpants serve the same purpose, and you can also work out in them."
"Got these as comfortable walking shoes for work and was pleased with the product.  I walk a lot for my job so needing a comfortable shoe that looked a little nicer than just casual street shoes was important.  They broke in fast and polished nicely....however about 3 months in the sides started to crack and split.  So unfortunately I had to find a different pair.  I recommend these if you just need to sit in your cube/ Office all day or just for a night on the town.  If you do walk a lot, I recommend a different product with thicker leather."
This belt is not leather.
"The only complaint I have, but it is a biggie, is that the dial information is so tiny against a grey background, that my 50-55 year old eyes simply couldn't see it. I do wear contacts (monovision) but the only way I could even come close to deciphering the information was to put on readers.

Seems like a great watch, but I tried this and the stainless steel model, which looked like it would be more readable with a white background. Well that background is NOT white and it seems to be the exact same watch as this, face included. In the end, I just couldn't enjoy the multifunctionality of this watch because I couldn't see the face well enough. If you've got good to great eyesight, you'll probably be fine. If you're over 40 and starting to wear readers, be warned you might have issues."
"xxl, fit as a XXL should. Poly cotton blend."
I used to like them until I bought a pair of brooks and that was the end of these. ;)). Once you try brooks its impossible to go back to anything else
"I orderes based  on the size charge and it's too big eveywhere except in the booty coverage.  Half my cheeks hang out.  I like it a lot and would exchange it for a smaller size, but don't was my entire booty hanging out."
"I purchased a six pack of these leggings and went back and forth as to whether to give 3 or 4 stars, and I'll explain my reasoning for both. First of all, I'm 5' 10"" and 200 lbs and I wear a size 12 pants.
Right out of the packaging I was thrilled with these leggings. They were thick, and felt super soft on the inside. When I pulled them on they felt maybe just a touch high on the ankles, but came up decently high around the belly as well which I liked (I have 3 kids and some flab to hide!) I wore the Burgundy pair right away and stayed cozy and comfortable around the house.
Now to my reasoning for giving 3 stars:
1. While decently comfortable, these leggings ARE rather cheaply made. The seams stretched considerably from the first time I wore them, particularly in the crotch.
2. I washed them inside out and hung them to dry, but there was still pilling after the second wash, and this proved true with each pair. It's not significant enough to be highly noticeable, but I imagine it will only get worse.
3. I continously have to pull them up. This is annoying, as well as somewhat embarrassing in public.

I believe that if you are under 5'8"" and a size 8 or under than you will not have some of the problems I listed, although the pilling seems to be a common curse."
I will have to take it in to get it tailored. I like the shirt but its cut larger than the Large black one I bought.  I have to pay to return ship to this seller so I guess I will keep it and get it fixed.
My daughter like them they cud hv been a lil bigger so they do run a lil small but they look gd on her
"I guess for the price I should have not expected better quality, its alright, had some fabric coming out"
"It's cute but didn't even cover my 11 month olds diaper, so had to return it"
the lips on the shirt are way more neon/bright than in the picture. There were a few strings of fabric hanging off and the shirt is not completely opaque. I will need to wear a bra + a nude bra. its soft. haven't tried it on yet. Its okay. wish it looks exactly like the picture (the lips)
Great fit but kind of irritated my ear.
Well mixed reviews... it's a nice purse the main one. But it's not big enough for me. The other 2 bags they were sent with it tho are a way darker pink so they don't match....
"If this is a look you like then perhaps it may be more for you. The twisted top was ill fitting and the material was very thin. I never wore this swinsuit, but not too upset as I didn't spend too much."
A little darker than expected.  & not very flattering.  Wanted more of a fitted scrubs.. I bought some more from scrubs & beyond
"Fit is not quite right. Slide down off my feet, Colored socks from same company fit well and are fun to wear. I might have just gotten a bad batch."
Easily causes blisters.  But very cute
Dockers need a longer rise and more relaxation in the seat.
It's about a half size too small. My toes are really cramped in the front and the way the shoe is shaped there's a lot of room in between my Arch and the shoe.
my daughter was super excited to get theses but was disappointed when the medium was way to large for her but the seller was super nice and refunded our money and told us to keep the shorts since it would have cost us more to send them back then what they are worth we are hoping in a few years she will grow into them they are super cute and the fabric was soft
I know of the legend of the three wolf one moon t-shirt.  I was hoping this shirt would come somewhere close to that level.  All it did was make my fiance go and get a pet cat.
Waist sizes run small.
I normally wear a size 8 US. I ordered a medium. They are snug. Snug to the point where they probably won't be comfortable after a few hours. The left boot shows yellow stains from the glue at all the seams. I'm not impressed but they are just costume boots so I will survive.
"This coat has very little insulation, so is not very warm.  Also the hood is way too big.  I will be returning it.  I found a great poly-fill (synthetic down) long coat at Macy's for half the price.  It's much warmer & cruelty-free to boot!"
Cute outfit but sort of difficult to get on and off.
The elastic becomes loose after wearing few times. it keeps coming out of my baby's feet. Not very satisfied.
"You get what you pay for.  It's just ok.  I don't like the velcro, it's too wide.  I had to cover half of it with felt."
I had to have a white skirt for an event.
"Pros: If you're looking for plain, cheap, decent workout shorts, then these are perfect. They are breathable, loose-fitting, standard mesh shorts. I got four different colors, and can report that they are accurately represented in the item listing.

Cons: They are shorter than I thought they'd be, but still suffices for workout shorts. These shorts also run small, so definitely get at least one size up from what you normally wear."
The three different tones are not very defined
These are very cute but they don't stay in place.  They slowly slip down the back of your head
Shirt is short.  Can't put in the dryer.
"It is comfortable, easy for walking.  The only issue is... you have to wear long socks because the edge of the boots will rub your skin."
"This product is cute and coverage is great, however, unless it's wet, it's VERY hot.  My 3 month old got heat stroke after wearing for a short period of time in the shade.  I didn't think about the breathability aspect when purchasing."
"So yeah..these did fit me..but was just a bit loose. As for the string, it wasn't cut so like that you can tie it like shoe lace. Its like one big ring & it doesnt hold that well. However, it does keep me warm esp. when the snow is here."
"This dress is really pretty, but I could not get it zipped. I ordered a size 14. I am just under 5'9"" & just under 200lbs. Measurements are 40x37x47. the length was not bad. I thought it was going to me longer on me, but a moderate heel would have sufficed. It is sheer on top. I had on a black corset body shaper while trying on & it didn't look bad underneath. Would have probably worked had I been able to zip up the dress."
Get a size or two up. I have long legs and a long torso and this skirt is very short  Quality is good thought
Was way too small.  I had to return them.
"A pretty ring, though runs large."
Don't know much about the shoe. Was a gift for my friend but they liked it for the moose part.
Very nice. The material and elastic is very thin and feels fragile. The assorted colors I received were 3 pinks 2 blues and 1 grey. It should be advertised as random colors.
Loved the looks of the book and made fairly well. But the sizing was way off so I had to return them. Which is why I can only give it 3 stars.
Its child sized (In America). I did get a partial refund. Besides that Its exactly as pictured. super cute I'm sad I cant wear it.
"Returning because there's a lot of extra fabric on the cups for me. It doesn't lay flat against my skin and will show under clothes. I'm a 34C 5'2'' 116 lbs, and other bras in 34C fit me. Rather than trying a B cup I'm returning since I found another brand that fits better. It seems well built though."
"It's like buying any shoe or trouser where size is important.  Why can't the folks in China get the lasts' sizes right, and why don't the folks in Boston make them do so?  I ordered an 11 but it's about half a size small.  I dare not send it back because the next one might be a half size too big.  I had this problem recently with an ""American"" brand of utility trousers.  When I wrote a review, the company actually called me up and when I explained the problem they told me ""The waist size can vary plus or minus an inch"".  So, a 34 inch waist size might actually be 34+1 or 35; a 36 waist size might be 35-1 or 35.  Really? that's the best you can do?"
"These pants are definitely maternity pants & I am not pregnant so it's a bit weird. They even have the band at the top that would go over a big belly. They are big at the waist & long (I'm 5'2"" so that's par for the course)."
"Dress is skimpy, one size should have fit me"
A bit too flimsy for what I was looking for. It's like a duffle on wheels.
"First off, I'm a certified ""watch guy"" and own quite a few.  I have a particular affinity for dive watches, as I both like the look of them and enjoy swimming and snorkeling.  Though I don't dive, and don't need a 300m or up timepiece, I insist on at least 200m water resistance and a screw down crown.  I've got a few Citizens and two Seiko Solar dive watches, all of which are great watches.

I decided to try the SKX as it's a traditional favorite among water sports enthusiasts, and I wanted a reliable automatic movement.  And at around $200 give or take the occasional sale, this model is a good watch for the money.

The 42mm face diameter is fine for my wrist.  I'm not a big guy, and anything over 45mm dwarfs my wrist.  42 is just right for a guy my size, and a nice alternative to the current trend of giant watches marketed by Invicta and other makers.  It's a decent weight, not too heavy on the wrist.

The jubilee bracelet is a new one for me, and although a lot of folks aren't crazy about them, I find the fairly light weight comfortable, though pin adjustment took a little getting used to.  I may swap it out in the future, but it's fine for now.  Simple and understated.  The clasp is firm without being too hard to close.

Hand alignment is good, though the one knock I have here is that you can't ""hack"" the watch to a time source.  Setting the hands does not stop the second hand, which is a minor annoyance to someone (like me) who likes to set a watch to an atomic clock.  That said, you can move the second hand back slightly with a counterclockwise motion of the crown to the 12o'clock position and get a pretty close hack.  Crude but it works. And there isn't the too-loose movement of the hands while setting you see on cheaper watches. A professional diver might have a problem with the smaller minute increments on the bezel (less visible in the water), but I think there's a reason for this, as the bezel doesn't take away from the overall look of the watch, which you often see with dive models.

I haven't had this watch in the water yet, but as it's already getting warmer here in Arizona, that will come soon.  I don't expect any problems. I've never been disappointed with a Seiko, and don't expect the SKX to be any different.  Based on years of reviews on watch collector websites, this model is a reliable ""go-to"" for divers who prefer to wear that expensive Submariner or Tag to the after dive happy hour rather than in the water.

Another nice feature is the crown, which is recessed and screws down for the tightest seal.  And it's placed at 4 o'clock, which gives the watch a cleaner look.

Though time will tell, (no pun intended) the SKX is a great watch for the price, and while I own quite a few watches, this will be worn often.  While if it's not a daily wear, it isn't a bad idea to invest in a winder, the watch ""rewinds"" with minimal wrist movement.

I expect to get a lot of years out of this watch, if previous Seiko experience is any guide.  Highly recommended.

Update:  After about three weeks with this watch, I reduced my rating to three stars based on a couple of factors:
1.  Accuracy is poor, compared to other automatic Seikos Ive owned, 20-30 seconds per day slow.  After having read a few articles about this movement, I may be able to have it regulated to improve the accuracy.  Ill give it another few weeks to break in the movement before taking it to a jeweler.  Im used to solar and quartz movements with much better accuracy, I guess.
2.  The lack of hacking turned out to be more annoying than I initially thought.  I can get the minute hand lined up, but it always moves off the mark when pushing in the crown.  If you're OCD about this stuff as I am, it can be a deal breaker.

Im keeping the watch, as it will be a good (if rather expensive) beater, and has performed fine in the water as expected.  But Ill stick to my Seiko and Citizen solar-powered watches for general wear.  Having to set the watch every day is annoying."
"Very, very wide!"
The quality is decent and the colors are so cute but the inseam length was disappointingly short. Other reviews mentioned them being long so I figured at 5'9 I'd be OK but they're just on the other side of too short and I feel stupid walking around in public in them. They're super comfy so I'll keep them but ultimately way too much to pay for a pair of pj pants :(
Color was different than in listing. But ok
"for being a size 6 they are very big, really did not like them"
"Still looking for old style high cotton content ankle high socks. These are good but not great.  I miss the cotton socks with thicker, more absorbent sole padding and not so thin everywhere else."
"I do wish Amazon would correct their website - - these are NOT made in the USA, they are made in China. I've had mine for about three years with almost daily use, but usually less than 8 hours per day, and I don't do heavy work. They have held up alright for the most part, but the welt started to rip away from the outer edge of the boot after only six months. Still, they are comfortable after breaking in (doesn't take long with the dual density soles.) I really appreciate the aluminum toe, which gives protection with little added weight. They support my ankles well when I walk on uneven dirt slopes at landfills and demolition sites. The soles do show some wear, and I suspect that they might not hold up as well for a guy who does heavier work than I do.

I bought mine at a Red Wing store. They measured my feet and told me I would need an 8.5EE. I told them I'd been comfortable wearing a 9D for nearly 40 years now... but they were right! I tried them on, and they fit perfectly, better than my previous 9D Timberland boots. The Red Wing guys knew what they were talking about.

These are pretty good, but I think next time I will try a pair of USA made Red Wings."
The fit is very nice true to size but i don't think the zipper going to last. It very hard to zip and it is not tight at all
"It fits slim. It is stretchy spandex material with rubber leopard print. Some of the sowing wasn't all that great some of the lettering wasn't fully covered on some corners, but its made in china kind of expected it.  I would not purchase again. Its just not worth the $35.00 imo. I cant believe it used to be upwards $150.00. I would have been very upset if I had paid that much.  All in all Its unique no one has anything like this around. If you want to be different and stylish its a pretty cool addition."
These leggings run small.  I should have gotten a size bigger than usual.
"Someone had hand altered the label.  The pants were supposed to be 50 inch waist, 32 long and they were 38 inch long.  Someone had hand written 32 inches. Husband does not like the pleats.  He says the pants are too baggy."
"These shoes are very nice on.  However, it is a bit narrow so by the end of the day after work my toes were grateful to have these shoes off."
The heel was a little higher than I expected so I can't wear them all day at work like I was hoping to.
"l like the concept of the glasses, but they are a little heavy in weight."
"Lovely pattern, but sadly, a bit smaller than the other two skirts I've bought from this listing. Also, lots of loose threads that needed trimming."
"Fits pretty well in the waist, however the inseam is ridiculously long. No need for these to go down to my knees..."
"I purchased two pairs for my son, who is a 31x32. I was so disappointed to find they did not fit. I see other comments with the same problem. He is consistent with his size on all pants. These arrived and they were way to small."
"The bright pink is really bright fushia, and I mean really really bright, not at all as pictured. Soft robe, still feels nice, but also seems somewhat cheaper than expected."
It's for my brother he just use it for less than month he till me it's nice but the way it's Handel the money it's bothering him it's good quality
"Fun idea, but I had to add wire to the ears to make them visible and stand up."
"The leather is quite comfortable, but the ankle part is very narrow and I tried hard to put it on."
"Order 2 sizes up. The fabric is hot and sticky, not for warm weather."
Not as nice of a it as my Sorels. Very thin sole. They are nice looking but I'm returning them.
I got a second pair because the first ones were defective....Still not right
sad to have to send it back but it was to small great color and quality other then that
"I bought these for my boyfriend, they're pretty good quality for the price and he likes them. The bottoms are not too thick like most flannel, and the top is very light for sleeping. He gets very hot during the night and he slept fine with these pajamas. I bought him the extra large, hes 6ft and about 230 pounds, they fit nicely.

*Update*
these shrunk in the wash, and there is no button on the fly!"
The shirt is a lil thin. But it looks super cute on. And he likes the camo.
"First, it must be known I give 5 stars to this seller who showed stellar speed in getting me the shoes. And 5 stars to Amazon for handling the return of the same.

This pair of Cyprus III Croc's gets three stars rather than the usual 5 (given to three other pairs of Croc's). Why? For those of us with high arches this shoe is troublesome because of the strap at the top. Particularly where the two straps meet and form a bump with a particularly inflexible (stiff) and unsmooth juncture which presses in to the top of the (very bony) part of the foot. For my feet these are an impossible design. Which is sad because they were adorable.

All other aspects of the construction of the sole, inner sole and how the vamp (top of the shoe) attaches to the bottom of the shoe is in keeping with the great quality expected from Croc's. I really wish it had worked for me. Hope it works for others. But those of you with high, bony arches, be advised."
"The mask is good quality and is really cool looking. My son loves it. The shirt is a very cheap material.  It is the kind of material that is a lint magnet, so will need a sticky roller. Also, it is a bit small. My son is 12 years-old and is average sized. He's not overweight at all and the shirt is snug. Not so much that he won't wear it, but, this would be a much better costume if it fit more loosely. If you are at all in doubt between sizes, go bigger.

Also, in agreement with other reviews, the mask is pretty stinky... but we just aired it out. Not an issue now.

Arrived quickly and in good shape."
Ordered pair a month ago and pair fit perfectly. Ordered second paiand was at least 1 to 1 -1/2 sizes smaller.
"Five stars for quality and style. And narrow calf ladies can cinch these up. They are extremely uncomfortable to walk in and are pretty heavy. I loved them, but for the price, I want better comfort."
"Shoes look great. Love that I can have non slip shoes that are stylish. This pair seemed much tighter then my other 2 pairs, which are both 9."
Arrived on time  in it's original box and at the begining it fit my son well but must say that the strap evenutally gives out
"okay, these shoes are very cute.. BUT.. first, I was sent a 6 instead of 9, but that's forgivable and not to big deal as I bought it on prime, so I exchanged for a 9.

the 9 came and they were really tight. I mean, realllly tight.  I had to walk around with thick socks on for about one hour to get them to open up a little bit, but I was still literally losing circulation in my toes... and I've never bought shoes over a size 9. In any brand. I am an 8.5 to 9.  these were tight, but not that bad, except the toe area..  my toes were so confined and my poor toes were totally squished. And I am not a big girl, I weigh 105 pounds and have pretty narrow feet.

if that wasn't bad enough, the glue where the shoes were put together turned yellow, being visible through all the little holes on the sides. Had they been more comfortable, I wouldn't have let the little spots bother me because they were so tiny and barely noticeable, but like I said, they were entirely too small, especially in the toe area, and a size 10 prob would be too big."
Orthaheel is the only shoe I can comfortably wear all day.  I usually wear a size 6 in Orthaheel- 1/2 size smaller than other brands.  I was looking for a mary jane style that would be a little dressier than the mules.  This shoe was too short for me.  Will have to reorder in a 7 and hope its not too loose.  I'd like to see a dressier version of Orthaheel.
"They were size 40, which I have in other Haflinger styles, but they were huge. Had to return them."
runs too small not good quality.
I bought a large thinking it might be a bit to big and it fits a small. Runs too small. Colors are true to the picture.
"A bit too small, be careful putting them on so you don't snag them."
"I ordered a size down as everyone said how big they were. They just barely fit my feet and I should have gone with my usual KEEN size. Also, the toe strap is really big and dug in uncomfortably into my foot. I love the style, but couldn't get over the discomfort.
I returned them quickly."
From the other reviews I expected a sturdier mask. This is a small step above the flimsy masks that come with the plasticy costumes at Halloween. My son likes to wear superhero masks so I wanted it for play. Will be more careful next time I order.
my daughter is a 10/12 and I ordered a L I could have gone up a size
"It fits OK, but too flat in the bust area, I guess it's OK for the money I paid. But I would recommend it to anybody."
"I purchased these looking for something with arch support. I hate wearing shoes in the summer, but need to have good support to keep my plantars fasciitis in check. These do have good arch support, but the shoe itself is not wide. Seems like it is made for very narrow feet. I also think they were a bit expensive for a basic pair of flip flops."
"wear a bit awkward, probably wouldnt buy again."
I love the look of these but they run really small.  I have normal width feet and it feels like it's gripping my toes too tightly.
"Arrived quickly, but don't work as well as pictured.  Had to use water and excess pressure just to get then to make a picture worthy foot print."
Puffy on the side
"It's fine for what it is.  It's large, but not huge.  It is exactly the dimensions the ad listed.

It looks like plastic, not leather.  The seams aren't perfect.  I suppose if you're going to fill it with cheap jewelry, then it's perfect.

Why did I give it four stars?  I'm not blown away.  I think it'd be great for a kid but for an adult?  I'm unimpressed.  I'm going to return it."
"These headbands are super cute, and I get lots of compliments, but, like anything made in China, they seem a bit cheap and flimsy.  Plus, the sizing is not consistent.  Some of them fit my baby's head well, and some I have to tie a knot in to fit.  A few of them are falling apart after a few uses.  I would recommend them if your baby won't take them off and play with them."
"Cool ring, decent quality (a bit ""light"" feeling- sort of ""tinny""), love the design.  Sadly it only comes in one size, and it's a bit expensive with shipping."
"These are a good supportive shoe but they run short.  I normally wear a 8.5D, but my toes are right at the top in these shoes.  I would recommend, just buy 1/2 a size larger and consider the next wider width."
They are light and comfortable but I need more arch supports then they give me.
Somewhat tighter than expected. Also yellow (yellow & black) wasn't as displayed. It was more neon yellow than the plain yellow shown.
"I had at least 6 pairs of the 846 indifferent colors (and over time) and LOVED them so thought I'd try this shoe. I also bought at least three of those pairs online with no issues with size. But this shoe - It's only OKAY - for some reason ALL of my socks slide down on my feet in these shoes. Thought maybe my socks were bad so I bought new and they still slide down and don't with the old ones??? Weird but it is an issue I'd rather not deal with. ALso the fit seems a little tighter in the toe box but as I'm breaking them in, that seems to be getting a little better. I'll be back in the shoe stores looking for a better fit!"
"I've found Hanes to be very inconsistent, changing fiber contents, sizing, and styling in the same product bought over a period of time and although these were tighter than the last batch, they're fine."
"Works okay, get what you pay for"
very nice but was a bit big for my newborn she was 6.6lbs
Lightweight.  Good quality for the price.
Had to return these shoes as they were too small. My spouse does have  very wide feet so i wasn't surprised. Otherwise we liked them. I returned the shoes approx. 10 days ago looking forward to a credit.
Two washes and bye bye
"LOVE this top, but it doesn't hold up well because of the fabric. It's nice fabric but stretches easily. I've hand washed it once and stretched out so I wouldn't dare throwing this in the washer machine. As a mom of 2 under 3, I can't really wear ""hand wash items"" but it was worth the 11 dollars. Just be careful! It kind of drapes the body, so if you're looking to hide bulge I don't think this will work well."
"I purchased one of these bras in a store, and I LOVED it! I ordered this one from amazon which was about $9 cheaper. It makes noise! Whoever heard of a bra that makes noise when you move? This is crazy! For the price, the company needs to figure out how to quiet down their product. The one I bought in the store, however, did not have this problem. I'm wondering about the sourcing...if they are made in different places?"
Uncle Fester polyester
"The tight is very thin and I don't think that can call ""sweater tight"". I bought it for cold days and I do not think that thin tight will work."
"Really like the style of the bag. Like the pattern too, except for the pink. Was much brighter than I was expecting. Hot pink just isn't me."
Nice for someone without curves
"Cup size is somewhat small I think, but still comfortable."
They fit true to size but they had some pumice stones or something left in the pocket. Probably during the detailing of the pockets. And they smelled strange. It reminds me of when my family visits from Korea and unpacks their luggage. But for the price and conveience I can't complain.
"I should have taken a hint from the model pictured, who is probably a size 2. The material is thicker than I expected, and would probably feel nice on a cool evening, but the cape does not wrap around me the way I'd like. I'm a size 16, and the edges *just* meet around my hips. Neck ties are rather short at 13.5"" each; I tied it without a struggle, but couldn't really give it any extra girth by tying wide.

It doesn't look bad, and would work in a pinch; it just doesn't give the flair and drama I was hoping for. And what is a cape for, if not flair and drama? Sending it back."
They get baggy easily.
"I love the look but on the inside top of the shoe, it is uncomfortable.  Hoping that will stretch and will be better, but right now it hurts to wear them.  If the shoes decoration was smoother inside by the big toe, the shoe, it would be more comfortable.  Hope this explanation is helpful."
"It was a good size and quality, but I ended up returning it since it didn't expand the way I expected it to"
"Returned, uncomfortable for old feet."
"This blouse is a lot longer than pictured. I'm 5'2"" and this is definitely a dress on me! It covers my butt, but it's does not flatter my shape at all. Other than that, the material is soft, the sleeves are nice, and the color is beautiful. I might keep it and just use my sewing skills to cut this ""short dress"" into a blouse. Then it'd be PERFECT!"
Fit okay but a bit shorter than the picture
Wish it had some polyester or spandex and was available in a women's cut and v-neck.
I liked the cross.  Very detailed but it was on the small side not what you would give a man something you would give a child
Felt great but this didn't last. The wedges only lasted a month so sad because it was comfortable
A little tighter than other Nike's. Buy a size bigger.
"I love the color of these, but they tend to run a little small and I think the quality could be better for the price.  The DKNY jeans I bought are half as much and far better fit and quality."
"It is made fairly well. The nightgown portion is a bit scratchy, but can be washed to help with that. It has elastic in the neck and sleeves, making it easy to wear. The fur is everywhere, but I didn't expect a really good quality, either. My only complaint is the mask is very misshapen. The package insert contains directions to use a hairdryer to heat up the mask to reshape it. I placed the mask on my wig form and tried to use my fingers and the hairdryer to get the bridge of the nose between the eyes to reshape. Ended up using a string tied between the eyes to get the correct (humped) shape. Doesn't seem to hold the shape. Black electrical tape will most likely hold it... granny glasses will disguise the tape. I'm using this costume as part of an illusion. Big, bad wolf in back, holding little Red Riding Hood (my upper body) in front."
I wish I would have spent a little more for a better pair.
Gloves are so little!!
"It wasn't until after a bit of observation that I realized that I had not received the swimsuit pictured. Though I will not post my own photos, you can see from other review photos that, while the design is extremely similar, it is not exact. I was quite disappointed when I had realized so.

However, I still do quite like the swimsuit. Like I said, they are very similar designs and it fit nice, though a bit tight around my hips. Make sure to follow the size chart, you'll most likely order 2 sizes bigger than what you're used to, but measure yourself just to check.

The material is comfortable, I had a bit of difficulty situating my breasts (D cup) at first but eventually I managed. The cups in the fabric are removable, though I've chosen to keep mine in. As for the underwire, it was a bit awkward and taking it out would be difficult, though I'm keeping that in as well.

I did in face make me look slimmer, though I had to frequently tug the fabric covering my stomach down because it would bunch at the top.

I haven't worn it into water yet, but so far, the purchase seemed neither disappointing nor thrilling. I'm fine with it."
"My son really wanted this belt as part of his Halloween costume as Luke Skywalker. It's a good belt. However, the ends did fray a few days after we got it. We burned the ends to stop the fraying."
"Excited when I got them out of the box, but my enthusiasm soon waned as they felt floppy and big on the sides. I have never had that problem with any Crocs. I checked and they were 9M (I wear an 8.5M in regular size) as they only have whole sizes.
I decided to take a chance and wear them...
I walked to the market for an hour and got huge and very painful blisters on the inside near the bridge of my feet,
What a waste. So sad."
returned too much money for what i was looking for
"I chose ""too small"", but maybe it's ""too large""?  I'm not sure what causes the problem... The problem is that in the attempt to have coverage, the cups go out to the side more, being wider-set (which I thought I needed), but I found that it touches and irritates my underarm area and decided that would drive me nuts.  I'm sending it back. Otherwise, it seems like a nicely-made quality bra. I like the styling in between the cups!  Sorry it didn't work out for me fit-wise...."
Not sure about these shoes yet.  I had to return the first pair because they were too big and very wide.  I ended up ordering a half size smaller and a narrow and the fit is better.  But the leather is quite stiff and I'm not sure they will be comfortable.
"This is rather large...bigger than needed. It serves the purpose but is very tough, like it's been starched. Hoping a washing will make it a bit softer."
Purchased this as a gift was disappointed in what was sent looked cheap. Was too late to return couldn't find a better replacement it is pretty don't get me wrong and the receiver loved it the quality could be improved.
Honestly they feel and look kind of cheap. I have only worn them once because they do not make me feel cool. Like something you would find at a drug store. Although I think they were pretty inexpensive so perhaps I expect too much. Just going to spend some money and buy Ray Bans.
"The watch is awesome, bought 3 of them, the reason I only gave it 3 stars is the watch band is crap, I weren't to Wal-Mart and got 3 new bands because its just a matter of time before the other watches bands break."
"I ordered a large do to my ddd, but it was slightly too big so I couldn't wear it, it's so cute"
"Good price, but uncomfortably tight on all but my skinniest of days.
I don't think a size up would have been proportioned correctly."
"It's okay, kind of bulky. I bought it to match my scrubs so it's cool for that. I would buy from this company again."
LOVE this item......wish I had got it one size larger tho....tends to run tighter than expected
not water resistant....nope
A lot thinner than I had thought. Definitely slips down...not good with my Converse.
"The bag colors are beautiful and the size is perfect for when you need a bit more room than a typical handbag.  It's good for overnight stuff, yet not too big that it looks like you're carrying luggage on your shoulder.  The 1 thing that I do NOT like is that as soon as I got the bag I went to unzip it and the zipper came off track.  So sometimes when I carry it I just don't zip it because it keeps coming off track and getting stuck."
"My order arrived on time with no issues. This nightgown and robe set is very nice. The quality is good, especially for the price. I would have rated it higher but, it was very small. I suggest ordering one size up, or even two sizes if you like sleepwear to fit full."
"Says 8.5, fitted more like an 8.. runs small."
"Love carters shoes cause they go with everything, especially if you shop the clothing at carters. The only thing I don't like is that they are not that durable so this is not a shoe to have the child play outside it. Wears very easily. Actually return them cause the front toe started peeling after not much activity."
its well made--but cut small and too long
"The arms on this jacket are abnormally long. Like they are for a 6 year old. We bought her a 4. It's really strange, but for the price we got I just rolled up the sleeves."
"These look good, but they are way too  large!"
"This seemed to be what I was looking for, a lightweight vest with many pockets. I ordered 4, one for myself and three as gifts. Mine fit well and seemed OK<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mrignt-Men-s-Travels-Sports-Jacket-Coat-Vest-Coffee-US-XL/dp/B00NIMOYI6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mrignt Men's Travels Sports Jacket Coat Vest(Coffee,US XL)</a>&nbsp;until I wore it first time and discovered the cloth lining between the lowest right pocket was not stitched at all on the bottom. Items put on the inside were easily removed from the outside and vice-versa! Otherwise the vest was as described and seemed fairly well made. I haven't heard of any problems from the recipients of the other three I sent as gifts so I hope only mine had a rare construction error.

And it seemed strange the zipper tab was on the left side!

As noted almost everywhere sizing runs small so check and measure carefully before ordering. I believe I ordered a 3XL, got a 4XL that seems to equal a normal USA Large so it fit well."
I like it I ordered the wrong size
The hanger hooks are exposed. Some airlines will ask you to sign wavier.
Had to return. Too large. Plus it looked cheap.
"They are not exactly like OMG!!! I gotta have this, however they are nice for the price I paid can't beat that."
"I ordered the red with navy, and was careful to choose the size based on other reviews. I'm 5'3"", ~125#, 34D chest, and the ""XL"" was fitted across my chest *without* a bra on (so the space between the buttons definitely would've popped open with a t-shirt bra on). However, this shirt is long enough to be a dress on my. It fell well past my bottom, and I was disappointed that it fit fairly well up top, but really widens out at the bottom and is so long. Sending back due to the fit, and also because the ""red"" was not red at all but a bright pink that really isn't nice to look at (in my preference, at least)."
"I received this item as a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  So I bought a XXL in this top because based on the size chart and the reviews, it was sized like most Asian clothing and ran a couple sizes too small.  OH MAN.  I should have bought a M or possibly a L instead.  The top I received is a tent! I literally can't even wear it to sleep in because I would be just letting my girls hang out the top of it.  It's definitely plus sized, regardless of what the size chart says.  Just for reference, I am 5'4, 153lbs, and I wear a 36D bra.  I am not a tiny girl.  I'm a size 12 in most pants/dresses, so a XXL in Asian sizing is normal for me.

Now for the good things.  It's actually very pretty.  It's quite vivid, and the top is very similar to the picture (something that rarely occurs when you purchase patterned clothing from China).  Now, the top appears to be a light cotton material from the picture, but it's not.  It's actually a heavy stretchy type fabric.  It's not bad, but it feels more like you'd wear it to the gym than to dinner.  With that material, I feel like it should fit tight, not loosely as in the photo.

All in all, had I gotten a size that I could actually wear, I would have been quite happy with the top.  The fabric is admittedly not what I was hoping for, but it still feels nice and would be quite comfortable.  I would have definitely kept the tank and worn it all over if it had fit me! So 3 stars because overall it really is a fairly nice top, even if it's huge and not exactly what I was expecting."
"I ordered these walking shoes 1/2 size larger than I normally wear.  They came in and fit just right.  If I had to do it again, I would order them a whole size larger to make room for thick socks.  They are very comfortable and plenty of traction.  I would give it a 5 star rating if rhey had disclosed the shoes run a size smaller.  Good price, good shoe."
"Beautiful ring, gave it to my daughter and within a week the cz fell out."
Love fabric. Pretty.  Too short. Only covers butt.  Only beach wear.  Not in town.
Great beard set. Did have an issue with the stick on eyebrows as the adhesive tape ripped right off the eyebrow itself when trying to get the backing off.
Not near the quality of the 812 shoe!  The straps have an elastic anchor that I suspect will not last very long.  I suspect that they did this as a solution to the complaint of short straps on the 812.  Also disappointed that the shoe no longer made in the USA!
"So big! In the pictures it looks like a cute, somewhat compact bag, but this thing was huge. Just to give you an idea, one small inside pocket can hold a tablet. I could fit a 15'' laptop, a change of clothes, water bottle, etc. The quality is good and the colors are fine. I returned it."
Low quality and runs small but at a reasonable price
The fit is small and I understand these are filled with memory foam but they are not very comfortable.
"Cheaply made, but gets the point across. It's spandex and one piece. The Cape is much shorter than its should be, and the mask is a halfmask that suckkkks. I opted to get the full mask on amazon, added a small bluetooth speaker behind the belt they give you, making the sounds of his breathe, and also able to play the music the dark lord marches to. Add in a really nice red light saber, and you will be the hit of the party. I got the XL, and it was somewhat small, and felt like my junk was bulging out, since this is a one piece suit."
straps broke off a week later.good to wear for a few days.
they were a little lighter in color than the photo and a little tight in my opinion.
runs small a extra large fits like a medium/large. I wear a large and order a extra large so it would be a roomy no such
I used these for my Poison Ivy costume and they were not bad. I didn't like the black shorts that were supposed to be somewhat of a liner so I cut them out put them over green leggings instead. However these leggings are kinda short. I'm 5'7 and about 130 lbs. They fit ok but  I wish these were longer.
To samll.
It appears to be well made and warm.  Will know better after this winter.
"Amazingly small, 1.5 sizes smaller than I usually wear-in New Balance I always go up a size, but this requires 1.5 sizes! Nice color, I ordered larger pair, we shall see. I hope to wear them on safari."
"The color is much darker than the photo and has a greenish, greyish tone to it. I don't mind the color, but I bought this for hiking and was hoping to have a brighter color so that I could be easily spotted in case I need help. The darker blue with the greenish, greyish tone makes me blend right in with the wilderness.

It's thicker than I hoped, but that would make sense with the tight weave that is necessary for true sun protection. It's fairly breathable. I was in the heat, but not overheated while wearing it. The heavier weight was not ideal for me and that was the uncomfortable part."
I was expecting some padding in the top for the boobs!  There was none there.  I liked everything but that.
These were smaller than the size L I have gotten for other Palazzo pants.  Other than that they are beautiful pants.
Arms were extremely small...I could not wear it but my girlfriend loved it
"They are nice shoes. The fit is slightly on the snug side  (to me). The back is very stiff and rubs my ankles raw... honestly, they'll manage; but, I'm a bit disappointed."
It is OK.  A little heavy.
Beautiful earrings but the pin is a bit big and my wife couldn't wear them because it was stretching out her ear.
These sneakers are absolutely beautiful and so cute on the little feet but not really true to size.  Would definitely order a size or even two sizes bigger.  I had to return the product twice to get the right size.
"It's really soft material. Very Comfortable.
But the colors are not what I was expecting. The hand that's hidden on the models waist has pink material, and the entire shirt has got lighter colors than what I would have thought. I was iffy about keeping it, but the money and effort I would have gone through to ship it back convinced me to keep it.
I've ordered other stuff from this seller, and liked one shirt but disliked another, so it's really a hit and miss with them. But everything is shipped promptly, arrives quickly and in great condition, and representatives are very quick to help with questions or complaints. So I wouldn't exactly recommend this, but if you're considering it, I wouldn't tell you to close the tab and walk away, either."
"Not crazy about the silky material, I like cotton better .. Haven't warn these yet so will see if I like this ."
"Bought a size medium due to the reviews and fit perfectly, but I put on just a little bit of weight so I feel like the fit is actually ""as expected.""
I'm 5'6"", size 27 waist, and 34 B/C bra size.

This crop top is cute; however the arm holes are cut sort of low, squishing my armpit fat out. This was never really a noticeable problem with other clothes I've worn, so I'll put most of the blame on the shirt. You can pull the sides up to cover that area of fat, but of course it will slip down. I think I'm going to return it."
not particularly impressed with boot. boot appears to be well constructed but the materials seem a little cheap.
"I've purchased southpole jeans from a retailer near my home before.  I saw that it was about $20 cheaper on amazon, so my intuition was to order it.  When received, it fit just as I assumed it would.  Only problem I have is the zipper is very hard to zip up or down.  It's as if i need to use WD40 on it or something.  Otherwise I'm happy with the jeans."
Irritated my ears. Beautiful earrings but I can't wear them for too long without them making my ears itch sadly. I have sensitive ears so if you do too I would advise you to stay away from these.
It does make my butt look higher and bigger but the material is very thin so it doesn't work for too long.
"The hands are not white like you see in the picture but have a metallic finish and are sometimes hard to see, depending on lighting conditions.  I wouldn't get a white nylon band again and probably go with a band that wouldn't stain.  After cleaning a 70 pound Amberjack the band had some ugly blood stains, that I couldn't totally get out.  Looked at buying a black replacement strap, but they cost over $9, which is a third of the cost of the watch.  Tried using a double sided velcro strap for awhile, but it would catch my clothes.  Ended up using a brown marker to stain the watch band brown.  The reason I bought the watch at all was because of the slip through strap.  I have broke quite a few watches where the strap hooks directly to the watch.  This watch was a replacement for a $100 plus Seiko watch that quit after about nine months.  Seiko doesn't make watches like they used to."
Great product just runs smaller then expected if you are buying get it 1-2 sizes bigger
"It's a nice shoes, I order one size up however it was a bit close."
Nice looking boot but it's clunky around my ankle and it runs small.  I wear 8 1/2 usually and I needed a 9 in this boot.  I wouldn't buy them again because of the way the ankle fits.
Got this for my little girl who is Wonder Woman. Was not happy at the craftsmanship. See photo
Pretty normal flannel pajama bottoms. They developed a ripped seam after one wearing which is why I only gave them 3 stars. Mended them and hope they last a while longer.
It is very big!  a little bulky but will carry all your needs.
"I was hoping these would fit in my hubands dress shoes to keep his feet warm while outside directing cars at funerals. Unfortunately they are way too thick and cannot be used for that purpose. They will be good for in his boots while hunting, etc."
My shoe fits but the area around my ankle has already torn at the seam.  I would almost suggest a half size bigger to prevent the tear.
"The length compared to the standard length t-shirts is excellent, but in the large size, it feels tighter than most other large t-shirts."
"Have to say these shoes don't feel much like my previous Asics Nimbus 14's.  They were stiff ...and felt ""cheap.""  Have broken them in now and they feel fairly comfortable, but wouldn't buy them again."
"I usually go with a large, but with past experience went a size bigger. Still not enough. Live and learn!"
Not quite what I expected but it works
"I ordered this because it's one size up from my daughters current dance shoe, but unfortunately it much too big for her. I should have selected the half size in between."
Niice looking but very stiff and needs more support.
Run small and quality is not good.
"Lovely jumper, but too small. I ordered a size up and it was still too small."
Little toooo small
a lot smaller than it looked
It's very cute but it doesn't even cover my breasts it is just above them very short unexpectedly short
"I just got these so I can't speak to the durability but I normally wear a 8.5 , and they don't make half sizes in this style so I was worried about an 8 thinking they would be too small. Turns out they were actually too BIG. I was thinking the 7 would be WAY too small but turns out they actually fit me. So all in all great shoe so far, just make sure you order a size smaller then you usually wear."
"really like the fabric, but a bit too small.  Excellent sller."
"Just to short really other than that really cute I would recommend. I wished they were longer to wear,they might fit others better than they do me."
"I like this dress, but I feel I should reiterate another reviewer: the fabric pills and snags very easily. Because it doesn't have a defined waistline, I wore a simple elastic belt with no rough edges to it and the fabric already has tiny rips and pulls. Otherwise, I like the feel of the fabric. Also a fair bit shorter than I was expecting. I wouldn't wear this to work without leggings. I got this at a great discount, I wouldn't pay more than $30 for it."
"These are tooo small unless that is what you need. One wash and they shrunk up to
fit a baby doll."
"I like this bracelet, however the more I wore it, I was not a fan of the clasp to hold it together. The clasp doesn't lay nicely and isn't a firm hold and I'm afraid the bracelet will fall off. Overall the bracelet is stylish and comfortable. The leather is two tones as pictured with alloy metals. I like the design and style as a woman but it's a men's bracelet. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
"Very Pretty - But - heavy - didn't fit well at the back.  Seemed to be a ridge there.  Not comfortable,  Didn't like at all.  Only kept because I didn't have others."
"I gave the shoes 3 out of 5 because they were too wide. Other than that, the shoe is pretty and comfy."
Fits small around the arms
"Cute earrings (for nose), but a bit too small."
Decent belt- my only issue is that it takes a lot of force to actually clamp down. if you can get a better hang of the clamping it would be much better.
"Shoe was made in India, I knew they would be too small before I tried them on. Seems like all items from India are under sized. Had to return shoes to seller."
Gold toe socks aren't what they used to be.
This headband is adorable but it was very awkwardly on the baby's head it sticks up and doesn't wrap around
The dress was only serged at the bottom not a turned hem.  Otherwise very cute a comfortable.
I love the look and feel of this bag. However if you wear blue jeans with it know that it will turn blue. Very sad that after carrying it two times it looks like an old worn out bag. Also the opening is too narrow and hard to fit much in it.
"Cute paints, but pretty flimsy. It would be nicer if the fringe actually was real and not just part of the print. They are comfortable though and I am glad to have purchased them."
The necklace is as described.  The chain looks like it may break easily and need replacing because it ia ao fine. I didn't pay that much so it's OK.  So glad it was on sale.
Size was a little small.  The color tone did not match the picture that well...
I continue to buy thorlo walking socks but the same problem persist...the heel gets a hole in it while the rest of the sock is still in great shape.
"After buying one shirt in an store, I really liked it and decided to buy more via Amazon. After purchasing and receiving three shirts of different colors they all fit differently. One was perfect, one was ok (little small), and another way to small.

I've run into this issue with jeans before and the issue was the origin of manufacture, the same with these shirts.  After inspecting the tags; each shirt was manufactured in a different country resulting in different sizes. Upon review of the shirt I previously purchased, that as well was a different country. Four of the same shirts (just different colors), four different manufactures, four different sizes.

Me personally, will be purchasing these in a store to ensure the proper sizing and lessen the hassle of returning these item in the future."
"Too thick. Perfect for winter, but terrible for summer. These would not be good for warm to hot weather. When did they start making these so thick. Bizarre. Totally ignore the review by the person that said these are thin."
"Not worth the price for me. Decently comfy but i was hoping the material would feel better. Slightly large to. Im a 29 waist, 6'1 and 150 so im not a big person but ive never had a small size underwear fit this big. I havnt dried them yet so well see! but decent underwear, not my favorite. These will be my workout boxers. Also the length is perfect. not short. i want to give them 4 stars but the price held me back"
Okay but mesh material is very thin...pulls easily. Must be very careful pulling on and off.
Nice hat but wish it were made bigger my head is not that big but the hat is kinda made for a child.
Very nice but gold is so soft. They bend pretty easily and I'm sure I broke one already.  Definitely won't last long for me. But then I guess I shouldn't wear them to bed.
"The earrings were much smaller than pictured.  They are ok, but I was expecting the hoops to be larger."
Chest was see-through. But rest of it was nice. Ill probably just donate it.
They are ok but look a little cheap.
"For the price, you absolutely cannot beat these. They are the same quality as the ones you'll find in a gas station for $10-$15 each. They look nice and fit well.

However, these are very hard to see through. I personally cannot stand when sunglasses make everything darker with far less contrast. I feel less safe driving with the sunglasses than without. They cause glare and really do make things more difficult to see. They are nice if you are going somewhere with a high likelihood of losing them or breaking them, but I would recommend spending the money and getting polarized lenses that aren't mirrored."
"Sleeves are to long and extend half way to my palms. The material and style is good. I should have bought a small. I went according to the Amazon size chart but was a bit large.
Does anyone know how can I return this blazer to the selller in exchange to a size small  or can I Taylor it?"
"I had compared the dimensions on the site to a fleece jacket I had and the Condor came up a little short (less than 1/2 inch though) in each dimension compared to the fleece dimensions.  I ordered the 3X (there is no 4X).  It is a nice jacket, I just do not like the way it drapes on the body.  The Spandex does not really allow it drape anyway.  I am 6 feet plus and about 260 pounds.  It does fit snugly but I think it is really the Spandex.  If I could relax the Spandex a bit, I would really like this jacket.  I love the number of pockets, especially the fore arm pocket.  I use it for my ID card.  I love the hood with the visor.  I wear it to work over a tee shirt and polo shirt normally.  I would say it would be comfortable no lower than the high 40s F by itself.  You could extend that if you wore a fleece or sweater underneath.  It is more comfortable in the 50s F though.  I have worn it in some pretty good wind and rain storms.  Wind intrusion is not a problem.  So far, the rain has not penetrated the material either.  The slash pockets are a little high up for me though.  It could be an inch or 2 longer in the overall length.  It could also be a bit more packable.  I wanted it to roll up in the bottom of my work back pack for when I travel.  Does not really lend itself to that though."
a-ok
Bought it for a friend and he wears it to the club!  Sometimes to private parties.
They hurt the back of my left heel.  I'm hoping breaking them in will help.  I have long skinny feet and boney ankles.  Not sure if it just hits me wrong but I hope they feel better the more I wear.
"Last batch was better. But for price, not complaining. Sizes were a bit on the small side and wore out fast. But again, for the price, I'll still return."
"I thought it was kind of small, but then again I have never worn this kind. Anyways I did like the material and style. Very cute!! Next time I'll order a size"
It's a good quality hoodie but the sizing seems off. I bought the size I normally wear and checked the size chart to make sure. Doesn't fit remotely.
It's OK-looking but not great quality. Looks like something you could get at one of those $5 stores.
Fits 2 small but made well. Would order again but in a bigger size.
"Really cute, but not durable. The wings got ripped within a few days. The wand lasted quite some time though."
got these shoes for my granddaughter she was a bit disappointed because they were too big but she will grow into them other than that I think she likes them they look sharp and hopefully will hold up well concidering the cost
"Meh. Its ok. I don't really think it fits like a boyfriend cut. That or their sizes run small. I like the color, but it appears more muted in person than in the photo."
It is a beatufiul swuimsuit. I purchased a 3XL because Im a 38DD bust. The top Is extremely small wish it was true to size.
"Boots are well made and extremely comfortable. They are very light weight and comfortable for all day wear.
If you want a light weight boot for your feet, These feel like gym shoes.
Update 7-7-2016; One big drawback is in the wear dept. The soles are thin and shallow in the tread. Would have been a great boot if the designers designed a deeper tread on the sole.
The soles are wearing baled within 4 months. You wouldn't get past a year with this sole if you wear them everyday.
If the mfg. re-fits the boot with a deeper tread sole, you have a winner, However, the sole should never wear out before the rest of the boot does, which this sole will.."
"The wedge part of the boot seems like it's made out of the gummy shock-absorbing type of material, but it actual makes quite a loud sound when you clip-clop around on a hard floor.

The sizing is not exactly generous.  I wear between an 8.5 and 9, and the 9 in this boot was juuuust large enough.  Any smaller and it would have been a dealbreaker.  Order your normal size, but if you like to wear thick socks you may not be happy.

The best thing about these boots is how small they make your foot look.  It's a neat optical illusion the way the sole cuts inward below the tip of the toe, because your eye registers the shoe as being much smaller than it really is.  So that's a plus.

I haven't decided if I'm going to keep them yet---it's hard to find mid-calf wedge boots for some reason.  They're not extraordinarily uncomfortable, but they're not over-the-top comfortable either.  They're just okay."
"I bought the skirt for a casual summer outfit option...but i am going to have  to make some adjustments. The material is really see through, and i bought the burgundy. I will have to wear a slip under it, but other than that its really cute. I would suggest to stay away from the light colors because of the see throughness.
 It  fits perfectly, and even though Its see through, its really soft and light fabric. It hides most of what i don't want to show through and still keeps me cool during the hot muggy summer days."
"It's nice, little hard to connect, and it runs small"
It's ok if you need an umbrella infrequently. Wind gusts makes this bend & flip over.
Ran a bit large; went down a size.
"The reason why I am giving three stars comes down to two things.

Functionality

and

Style

Functionality wise, the scarf is quite thin. When held out in front of you it is nearly see through. Therefor it doesn't do great at keeping you warm. Most likely fine for anything above 40 like a chilly autumn day or a warm winter day. But bellow that you will feel the cold come right through.

And style wise, same problem. The scarf is very thin and the knitted pattern is very feminine. If that is a style that doesn't concern you or what you're looking for then more power to you! I was just looking for a simpler more masculine type design to it. That is all.

The scarf itself has nothing wrong with it, it is okay, as to why I gave it 3 stars. It's alright. Just not the warmest and in my own personal opinion, rather feminine. Just simply not what I was looking for."
"I have a thin foot and the new tongue design (fixed on the inside) does not work for me. The tongue is made of very stiff material and when I tie the shoes tightly, the tongue cuts into my foot; very uncomfortable. This is a case for me where the evolution of the design does not work as well as the original design. I'll have to look elsewhere in the future."
"Decent quality, but on the large size.  Normally I purchase Asian sourced items 1/2 size larger as the vendors primary customers are in Asia and the customers are generally physically smaller.  Consequently they use patterns and menus based on this smaller size demographic. I did return the shoes for a refund. Good value for the price. Thank you Amazon!"
"Too large, way too long.  I washed them to try to shrink them, so I cannot return them.  Bummer."
"The price of this boot far surpasses the quality. Maybe at a 75% off it would be doable. Not luxurious, they look and feel like an average pair of boots. Nothing setting them apart from others. Sorry this one goes back!"
"These are cute, but I ordered the smallest size and there is no way my baby will be able to wear them this winter. Might fit when she is two years old, but these won't work for an infant. However, if you don't need them small they are very warm and easy to put on it seems. Decent quality for the price."
Buy a size up than your use to. Still a good quality hoody.
"Looked sort of big on me and one of the shoes was larger than the other, but they were very comfortable and worked well."
Shoe is great and comfortable but one fault is that the elastic near the buckle has a tendency to break
"the final QC/QA department needs to check the size of the product before they ""stamp/silkscreen"" the ""size"" on the item. Received (3) items but one was obviously small in size but marked XL"
I loved this but I had to return it because it was way too small.
it works but its fussy having to put it on. But it is waterproof and is a good product.
The quality is not great. After a week of use one of the clips of the laces fell off.
"Good quality ring and I like it for work, runs small I would go up 1/2 to 1 size higher."
"I am fit, strong and normal weight. I usually look good in jeans called ""slim"" ""skinny"" ""tight"", etc. I seek them out. These fit my butt and waist, but the legs are so slim I could barely pull them up. If you have any muscle development in your legs, these will be too tight. It is best to be slightly underweight. I had to return them."
"These socks are thin and don't cushion much.  They fit on the small size as well. There seem to be different qualities of Hanes socks, since I have some that have very thick material and cushion toe and heels, and the part that holds your ankle is very elastic.

These are an inferior grade.  Arrived quickly, packaged in a big box."
Spandex cotton? I just wanted cotton. Why do these fit weird?
Actually very pretty but worried about having to clean the delicate moving parts if it darkens as silver does. Opted for a bit more expensive white gold piece.
"great for one time use for basic costume. quality is not very good. shirt is very itchy. item comes incredibly wrinkled - we hung it in the bath room during showers, washed it, ironed it.. they do not come out. heads up."
"Love the shoe, but ordered up a half size due to heel, dress pump, etc. Usually wear 9.5 t- he 10 in Vnce Camuto runs vety tight in the toe- ball of foot. Had to send back. Pretty color, broke my heart!"
"These earrings are very pretty and have an elegant look, the only reason I had to return them was because the stem was so thick it was painful for my pierced earlobes.

I found another pair of leverback drop earrings by Berricle that were actually more beautiful and far more comfortable to wear.  BERRICLE Sterling Silver Asscher Cubic Zirconia CZ Solitaire Leverback Earrings."
"Not as long as picture appears, barely at hip level. Fabric is thin, as expected for the price."
"This is a good thickness to keep you warm, however the fibers on this shawl are surprisingly long... on average they go out about 1/2 inch beyond the connecting threads... so it made me feel like you have to maintain the look and pile of this by brushing the fabric with some sort of delicate brush or your fingers and also dry-clean only. I'm sure you'd also have to be fairly careful when wearing this so it does not snag or get tangled too much. That being said though, it does look stunning. I gave this as a gift so I'm not sure how the upkeep has been."
"Not as much slouch as expected, but still a good beanie."
"Cute boots, but does not fit a child with wide feet.  The boots do not stay on wide feet for more than a second"
"My husband has had many pairs of these over the last few years.  One problem seems to be that every time we order, the size is just a little different."
"It's okay.  Not my favorite suit, but cute enough to wear to the pool!  Just fits me a little funny where the key-hole sits.  The description on this suit said ""Red"" but is definitely a dark pink.  I have a short torso and usually wear a small/medium; this I ordered a sz 6.  I'd say they run a little small!"
"Unfortunately I received these a day too late. (had to cut nose ring out the night before) but I like these. They are quite small, so when I repierce it I won't have to worry about these sticking my septum. they are very cute too!"
"bought them last year, comfortable and cute but not well made. they scratch easily and look extremely worn after 8 months or so."
"The space between hooks is smaller than it is on actual bras, that makes these really inconvenient to use. I am crafty, so I can make it work, but I suggest you buy another product, if you are not good with your hands."
"it works ok for standard size watches. however if you, (and a great many) have the oversize timepieces it does not have the adapter to handle them."
"Here is a SIMPLE Review:
I bought 2 pairs of these pants. Wearing Pair #2 right now, they are 4 months used.
I've Worn them while Traveling back roads and RR tracks from Central Oregon to California, 2 months everyday use - and a Hike from American Canyon to Yuba City just a week ago.

YES:
-The Sizes are True: 32x34 i think - though I cant read my tag, it is worn off.
-They have leg room, almost too much. I always rip the crotch after a few months. I Gotta tuck em like a Samurai before getting Low.
-The Belt Loops are Wide, Double Thick, Spaced nice for a knife or holster- I have used both on these pants .
 (I am a Man, so No ""Leg Drop"" Holsters for me.)
-They are Light.
-They are Tough against Abrasion and Sharp stuff, holes Dont Grow after they are made which is awesome. Wouldv'e been neat to see the Bros here mention that...
-Cops think they are BDUs. Lol.

NO:
The Strip inside for ""Keeping shirts tucked in"" IS NOT ""GOOD"".
I said the same thing, ""Neato!"" - until I rucked up and put on miles. It rubs me RAW, my shirt stays- but only a Compression shirt will stay after working on ground level and getting up again.
- Also Note -
Check the Picture.
These are One Layer of Ripstop. Nylon can burn EASY - the hole by my thumb in the pic was made by a SMALL ember from a Hemp Wick... ""Wow""... I did that months ago, the hole hasn't got larger thanks to the ripstop...

If you Stand and Walk around, get in and out of vehicles, want to look ""Tactical"" with the Bros - You will probably never notice these things. But, I hope my Observations can help you see something other than the standard ""Avid Hiker"" ""I Like 'Tac' Pants"", ""Leg Drop Holster"" ""Law Enforcement"" ""I'm a Marine"" noise about these pants.
As with most things- there are Upsides and Downsides- That is what I have tried to bring here."
"The fit was good and the shoes look good, but they rub really badly at the top of my heel. Wish I could fix that problem without messing up the shoe. Otherwise they were as expected and shipped fast."
"Nice business ties I've otdered the red, brown and the blue they contrast nicely with a dark suit. Price also very good"
"Pretty interesting watches, lots of compliments. .. it is a shame you never know what size you will get. .."
"Bought the Toto, which is my third pair ordered through Amazon. All three were the same size/style, just different colors and they ALL fit differently.

I really like the style, color and the length is perfect. The fit around the waist is a killer! I don't know if I should have gone up two sizes. Try them on at a store before ordering online."
"Size is good but I seriously doubt that these are ""Diabetic"" socks as they are much too tight at the top."
Horrible Size! Not happy with them at all!! They are too small!
Nice shirt but very lightweight and a bit large
turned out to be too large for my bag.  takes up more space than the other two cases together.  Maybe I'll get a new bag because it certainly is efficient as a glasses holder.
"This shoe is adorable.  If you are going to purchase it though, ordering might be tricky.  The 7 which is my normal size, was not only too small, but so uncomfortable.  If I was to reorder, I wouldn't know how to...extra width, size up, would really need to try them on in a store.  The sizing available to me made me think...what size should I consider.  However, this shoe is so stunning!"
Nice but way too small and overpriced. Returning them.
"What this product lacks in it's zipper design it makes up for in versatility and cuteness.  If I had to purchase again, I'd be on the fence for something less cute but much easier to zip/unzip.  You always have to leave room to sip up so you can zip down to take the coat off.  It also almost takes me 2-3 tries to get the zipper started to unzip.  I love that you can switch sides to have a water/wind repellent outside or a cute fuzzy side.  It fits great and look cute."
"I love the look and fit of these shoes.  Why the three stars?  They don't last.  I've had two pair and they each wore out before the warranty expired.  I don't consider myself especially hard on them, either.  I wear them daily to walk the dog on sidewalks, in parks, and on some trails.  In the first few months, I can walk through puddles (and streams, if I so desired) without getting my feet wet.  Fast forward 10 months and I can't walk through wet grass without getting soggy socks.  I thought maybe my first pair was defective.  I was disappointed when it happened to my second pair, too."
"""The small bag was too small for my needs so I returned and reordered in the
medium. Item put together very well, roomy and have already received the medium
bag. Contact with the seller was prompt and pleasant."""
"I like this top. The medium fits snugly, while the L is more relaxed on my size 10/12 frame. While I kept both sizes, as I do find this top cute, it is a HEAVY fabric and does not breathe well on hot days."
"These are a little bit small, but i have just been squeezing in to them because i love the way they feel and look."
tey won't last a week
Great shirt but way too bug. Had to send back.
"it is a nice hat, the color is green not tan, the center arc of the bill is off center of the hat probably because of the eagle on the bill, took a while to get it to look right, having said that it is a nice hat with an eagle on the side and an eagle on the metal clip on the back"
"When I review a product or service I try to be very straightforward and candid. My goal in a majority of cases is to provide enough information to help someone else who may be considering the same purchase.

I was excited to receive this dress. All those positive reviews I read over and over again convinced me this would be a great buy. Then, when I received and opened the package, there was a very large pink note card that stated ""...After you leave a positive feedback and a 5 star rating on the product review, please email us at ""---"" with your order number and the buyer name used. You will receive a complimentary necklace or bracelet. :)""

I love leaving 5-star reviews because doing so means I received something I truly loved. Unfortunately, a free bracelet or necklace will never convince me to endorse something I am not 100% happy about. I'm really beginning to question the authenticity of all the positive reviews I read about this and some of the other products I'm interested in because in so many cases the product didn't live up to the hype.

About the dress: the fabric is wonderful. It flows nicely and is very soft to the touch. At 5'4"" and a size 8, this was a perfect length for me. The pockets are a very nice feature as well. This would be comfortable on a hot, sunny day when you're lounging around home or out for a quick bite to eat, shopping, etc. The downside: it's unbelievably large and did not flatter my frame at all. I felt swallowed up in this and I doubt that even a small size would have alleviated the problem. It's a great concept but simply not for me. I'll keep it to lounge around the house in as it is truly comfortable and the fabric is cool and luxurious.

Some of the other reviewers probably look lovely in this dress. I'm not bashing the dress as every fit is a personal one. Since it is oversized, this would likely look beautiful on someone with a tall, slender frame. I'm just tired of receiving endless emails and notes in packages persuading me to write a positive review for a free gift or future free merchandise; hence, the deduction to 3 stars."
"Super cute, but not as thick as I'd hoped. Also, I don't have big calves, but they seemed pretty tight. I DO own WW socks now though!"
"I was really excited to wear this Eternatastic Women's Plus Size Vintage Floral Swimsuit Bikini With Chiffon Long Skirt bathing suit, it is so beautiful! There are so many great reasons to love it! First the floral print on the top is so gorgeous and the XL fit me so perfectly (I have size 38 D bust)! However the stitching on the top was horrible because after wearing it one time the stitching was already coming lose. I was so sad when I saw that. Also only one side of the top had boning with i thought was very odd.
I really love the bottom as well. I love how much coverage it gives me but I was expecting it to be a little more higher up on. But the skirt is nice and long and hit me right below the knees. I am 5'7 and XL fit me so perfectly! Other than the stitching and boning issue, I realy love it.
I received this at a discount for my honest opinion."
It looks as described. Is very cute. Unfortuanatly it ran very very very small and was way to short for me to where. you should be fine if you are of normal height. I am 5' 10.
"These are... OK? My daughter loves them, but they are not the quality I expect from a name like sketchers, nor do they live up to previous twinkle toes we've had. The sizing is inconsistent between the two shoes. One has much longer Velcro strap s than the other and/or is somehow wider... Basically when she has them on one side has excess Velcro, and the other side is sort Velcro. It's weird."
"These are nice pants, especially for the price but they run really small. I normally wear a size 6 but ordered up after reading other reviews. I ordered an 8 and they were still too small. Had to send them back."
"Nice ring, but runs small."
"These mittens are OK.  They are very soft and snuggly, and seem like they will be very warm. However, the thumb part is hard to work on an infant (8mo), and the velcro actually seems to annoy my son.  Other mittens stay on his hands better than these do."
I bought a large size for my husband it was too small for him but just right for my 12 years old son
"I now the sunglasses can be better, there not $8, but $14 because they don't qualify for free cheeping. I bough them any way because I needed them."
"I had never had these types of ear muffs before so was worried they would not stay on.  They do work, but after a long period of time they can start making your ears sore from the pressure of the metal that holds them on your ears."
"Cute shirt, fit pretty well and has held up through multiple wearings and washings."
"Like this dress, but wished it was 100% cotton."
Guess I will lose a couple of pounds for it to look as good as I would like for it too!
I returned them.  They run wide and a little short.  Order up half size
I like it but it's very big.
Too small. I had to return them.
"Not as pictured. Thought I was getting a nice cerise, turned out to be fluorescent, glow-in-the-dark pink. Ew. Nice buckle though."
Like the fit but the material is really scratchy on mine. Hence the 3 stars. Will have to wash it to see if it will smooth it out.
"It's of excellent quality, but It's very short, as someone very thin"
"Way too much glitter for me. The size was slightly smaller than expected. I would have kept them except they were much too glittery
for me. Sent them back and purchased a basic color."
A little small for my 2 yr old. But it will have to do
feels good but lining of shoe is not smooth with some socks i guess its a traction thing still not bad for price
Nice but looks very ship.
"Runs big, at least a 1/2 size too big. The color and style is great and the heel a perfect height for my evening dress. Unfortunately I had to return because it was too big, especially in the heel"
They just run small--
"Wasn't as comfortable as hoped, so returned it.  Nice sandal, but not for me."
"they look much better on the photo than in ""person"" they fit ok, the finishing is not so good, they are a little unsticked in the join between the platform and the pad. I thought they were more elegant"
"These are really cute, but run large. I wear a 7-7.5, bought a 7, couldve worn a 6 or 6.5. Theres a big gap at the back. Didnt feel like exchanging, will wear anyway."
"This was impossible to get on my 2-year-old's foot, despite being a tad big for him. The bungee closure system may be ok for bigger kids, but I don't think it's the best for toddlers. These are going back and we'll find something with simple velcro. Too bad, because the shoe was really cute and seemed very sturdy, as can be expected from Keen."
"Very, very small. Returned with no problems"
"Needs more padding or whatever for the bottom of my feet. They're ok, probably won't last too long, will try another brand next time."
"Really cute cover up; however, the sleeves run tight."
Doesn't look like the pictures but still kinda cute
Smells bad for almost 2 weeks. Leave it open with everything out so the smell goes away. Takes about 1 week for the smell to somewhat go away. Nice looking though.
"I love this bag so much that I now have it in black, red and now purple.  Very nice durable material and great zippers all the way around.  My only negative is the strong chemical smell.  This has happened with all 3 colors.  As soon as I opened it up I put a couple of dryer sheets inside and hung it out in my garage to air out.  However, a week later there was still a bad smell.  Hopefully the smell will dissipate as I use it.  I always carry a pack of tissues in my purse, so that will be a good test if they don't take on the odd smell.  If the smell goes away as it did eventually in the other 2 colors, I would definitely give it a 5!"
A good belt with a quality feel.
"I wanted a pair of inexpensive boxer shorts because I didn't feel like throwing away money for just freaking underwear. At the same time, I wanted something that would be comfortable or something that isn't noticeable. What you can expect from these boxer shorts is just that. When I got them out of the package, my first reaction was negative because of how the material felt. It felt so cheap and weak that I could probably find something like this at a Dollar Store. My reaction changed after they went through the washing machine. The material still feels weak, but it feels a lot better then what they were originally. I'll try and post pictures of the boxer shorts before they were out of the original packaging to show you an idea of what you'll get. Just keep in mind, that the colors are random and you might not get the same colored boxers."
Loved other Kamali dresses but this was just odd. Not sure whether the top and bottom were supposed to remain attached. The top was a bit too long on me to give that silver of bare midriff and it looked wrong. I was happier with the more streamlined style.
"Looked nice, seemed good quality, but barely too small in the calf area.  Had to return.  Probably fine if most boots' calves fit you.  Shoe area seemed to fit as expected."
Bag has feet to save the material on the bottom which is good. The material itself looks study but feels a bit like plastic and not material or luggage like as I expected ... the good news is you could wipe it down and since we'll be using it for art supplies to take back and forth - it was fine.
"Fit good, both buttons broke though"
"Unfortunately, these fit more control top than I expected.  The pretty lace kind of gotten lost in the legs and I felt like the tighter support panel actually made my stomach look bigger.  I usually wear a a 9/10 in vanity fair briefs and found this 4X to be snug.  Important!  Colors fade, too!"
a bit smal but wear with thin socks and it is okay. I would suggest ordering up.
"fit well, but are thin"
"Great to wear when you are getting a pedicure, but the fit is too floppy for the size given."
fabric is fairly thin and rough. they tend to get so wrinkled that i cant even fold them after washing unless i iron them. cheaply made but very inexpensive.
The shoes are fine. I just didn't like the way they looked on my feet and I'm returning them.
"I had to return these, but I am not sure I should blame the sandals for the issue I had. I have flat feet, and so I was looking forward to the arch support. Unfortunately, the shape of the sandals did not match the shape of my flat feet very well and so I was left with pressure points in a couple of places that would rub and irritate me as I walked around.

I was also surprised by the weight of these sandals. Note that the sole on these things is built like that on a hiking boot. It is solid and heavy."
"Good, use it all the time."
"I was expecting these to be a little nicer after I read the other ratings. They are comfortable and cute, though. The first issue I noticed was that the socks leave a lot of black fuzz on my feet compared to other black socks. Also, my feet are on the smaller end of the given range, but the socks were still a little too big. They lasted only about a year or so before wearing thin and developing holes. I was expecting some more durability. I liked them enough to continue wearing, but I will not repurchase them."
I love the shoe but they should tell you that they run small. I needed a half size bigger.
"Its okay, just cheap material."
"The wig was garbage, but had to return outfit."
"It's smaller than I expected. I wear a medium in pretty much everything so I bought medium. A large may have been too big, but this one is a little snugger than I'd like. A foundation garment may help. But it is beautiful."
"Cute, but get dirty fast  One was missing the plastic cover, so I am not using it. The price was right though"
"these shoes are beautiful and the color is really nice.  They are a little narrow at the widest part of the front of my foot, but since they are leather, I hope to stretch them a bit.  Otherwise, they are a really nice fit."
"Thought I would like it better - it only carries the bare minimum of ID and credit cards. I occasionally when I just need some bills, D.L. and a credit card."
"Cute, very cute, but a super weird fit."
It fit and is comfortable.
Fit is smaller than sizing would suggest.
I ordered my normal size and they are at least a size to big.
"The hoops were broken when they arrived and I couldn't fix them but the rest of the earrings were nice, for the price."
I fell in love with these pants but after about 3 wears they split up the butt crack seam. I would size up if I bought them again.
"Cute dress, decent material but size 2 was quite  big and so I had to alter the dress."
The ring looks good but it is hard to see the blue. The picture is not what you get. The size is right on and it came on time.
"Amazon does not provide a sizing chart for these shirts - sleeve length, neck, etc.  As such you are just guessing.  We returned it for a different size.  The shirt appears to be good quality, including an elastic button on the neck."
Bought this to go under a costume for Halloween as it was cold out but the arms were like 3/4 length.
"Nice shoe overall.  However, this style seems to be narrower in the front foot area than another style of Tsukihoshi shoes.  Nice and versatile colors, though.  Have to return these and purchase the previous style."
Fit a little small and the color was not Bare.  Nice bra otherwise
Quality was good but it was waaaay to big.  I am a 25 inch waist and usually fit a small. I ordered a small in this and it was unwearable. The size was more like a medium.
"Very nice, but run a size small."
"Not what I expected, but need a skinny belt, so will have to do!"
"I gave this a 3 bc while the quality was decent it was labeled a ladies Xl and was more like a medium. I know we're bigger in the US but I wish stuff would fit according to the country you're sending it to standards. And even though customer service would exchange or refund, with a 26$ shipping fee. It's not worth sending back."
"The wallet is very functional, with a lot of storage and plenty of credit card slots.  The design is very cute.  The problem is that it looks old and worn almost immediately.  I saw one review that said it started to look bad after 2 months.  I don't think mine even took that long.  After 6 months, there is almost no red on the edges of the wallet anymore."
"I liked these, but they were smaller than expected. I ordered them for a pageant, and they are maybe an inch and a half long."
"It definitely pushes my boobs together creating more cleavage, but when I put on a shirt, it makes my boobs look like they're shaped weird."
"This La Roche-Posay Respectissime Soft Eyeliner Pencil for Sensitive Eyes is true to its claim. It did not irritate my sensitive skin. I was able to easily apply the eyeliner. I have found that it is easiest to apply when the pencil is sharp because it doesn't pull at all. It doesn't come with a sharpener but you can sharpen it with most any sharpener. As I said before, this product works well with sensitive eyes. I am emphasizing this because my friend who has even more sensitive skin than I do borrowed it and had no problems with irritation. It stays on pretty well but I found that when I did light exercise such as dancing, it did start to smudge and it made me look like I had been hit in the eye. This effect didn't last long because the eyeliner was very easy to remove. For me, the most annoying part of this product wasn't the product itself or its application but its packaging. I broke a fingernail trying to open it and ended up having to use a box cutter to open it."
It is very thin and clingy.  I bought a s/m and it shows the lines of the shirt underneath.  I guess you get what you pay for.  The color is nice and it did not run in the laundry.
These don't take long to provide a relax fit
"The shoes fit really well, however they looked very clunky and big on my feet and I wasn't a fan of the shiny leather. The shape is a bit strange too, narrow in the middle with a thicker heel. Sent them back!"
"She is really cute. My foot is on the narrow side and my feet don't slide to the front, clawing the shoe....a plus. Only down fall is that they run too small. My feet were hanging in the back! Order a size up or you will be returning! I ordered a 10 but it fits like a 8 and half or 9!"
"Larger then expected, but will try to work out"
"Not what I expected, very trendy, looked more like a very old lady coat. The boat was pretty warm but not for me."
Great concept for a shoe / Aqua sock. But after awhile it will rub on your skin making it raw especially if you plan on trekking through sand. It's perfect for extremely local use but if you plan on walking a mile or more you may want to consider something else
"I love the look of these boots.  However, the sole is not very thick and after standing for an hour, my feet do hurt.  Maybe an insert might help."
Sou-sou.
"Nice material soft and comfortable. Runs small. I normally wear a large and I couldn't even dream of zipping it. Mostly small in the chest/shoulders and im not large in either area lol i would order 2 sizes up if i were to reorder. Nice length,  Nice flow when spinning lol"
"A good-looking high quality shoe. The length is fine, however the toe box on this new pair is much narrower than that of my comfy older VANELi loafers that I've greatly enjoyed and had high hopes of replacing with similar kind. Regrettably, I cannot wear the new loafers and had to return them."
Fairly good quality verry roomy but they take forever to ship
"The bodice and bust fit fine, but the seams are weak for something that needs to stretch going on (over hips) and the leg holes are too small (they don't follow the rest of the suit sizing). You're getting what you pay for."
Picture looks a lot better than what you actually get. They look very cheap. Not the best quality. They fit strange as well. Returned them
"This serves its purpose. It is warm enough but does not make my head too hot. The band size is just right.
I do not like this color at all which is why I gave it 3 stars. Also, where the band loop  and button meet, it is
already stretching out."
"Good pricing, showed up in individual bags instead of on cardboard holder as shown in the pictures. Already lost the back to one earring though "
"The shoes were really cute, and the size is just as expected, but the buckles were too big and made it really hard to fit through the hook. You have to use force to pull it through and in a way it wrinkled it and makes it look cheap. It also has no grip so it's slippery.
I like them, but maybe not worth the price"
I was expecting a bit more with this necklace so it was okay.  The quality doesn't match the picture.
"My wife got this for me to use as a wedding band... I wore it one day and then we got something else. The ring is super thin and wide. It was uncomfortable for me to wear it. It also looked and felt really cheap, which it is."
Flying Fisherman 7715BS Sunglass is excellent
"Although the waist fit perfectly, the legs were extremely loose. My husband could have put both legs in one leg of these pants. We like the tough fabric, which I'm sure would wear well for years. It's unfortunate the legs of these pants are cut so wide. We're returning them."
A bit bigger than I thought it would be
"Yes, nice tapered leg, but I suggest spending a little bit more money on a Nike pair. These are too thin to run outside in the winter. They are baggy everywhere but the ankles, even wearing a size small. The material is also cheap; I've been wearing them a week and there are so many little fabric pulls in the weave that they look old. Perfect for the gym."
"These shoes are nice. But they weren't as comfortable as I would have liked. Plus, I was caught in some rain, & they got ruined. Can't afford to buy another pair like that. Plus, the price I paid, you would think they would be more comfortable."
"UPDATE: 15 NOV 2014
The newest version of the Wind Resistance Gloves uses C40 Thinsulate (40g) insulation, with an all-fleece exterior, and touch-screen friendly materials on the index and thumb finger tips. The new touch-screen material works on the capacitive HVAC control ""buttons"" on the MyFordTouch system, but the new material also adds extra thickness and significantly reduces the tactile feeling of the thumbs. I have a hard time using the steering wheel controls with these new gloves. The all-fleece exterior and Thinsulate doesn't seem to do anything extra for insulation compared to the old gloves (which used a wool/polyester exterior blend and some generic insulation). I recommend going 1 size larger than what you normally wear, just so you can get in/out of the glove more easily. For example, I normally wear MEDIUM for all of my standard Mechanix gloves (Fast Fit / Original) although I can use LARGE just as well, the LARGE Wind Resistance glove is easier to put on or take off.

Mechanix Wind Resistant Gloves, Large

The sizing is true to Mechanix gloves' other sizing. My hands measure in-between Medium and Large. Medium will fit, but gets to be tight. Large will be slightly larger/looser but is usable. These Wind Resistant gloves are constructed of a polyester fleece material on the inside and outside, but the palms and finger tips are wrapped with a thick and heavy-duty polyurethane material not unlike many ski and hunting gloves. Out of the box, the gloves feel stiff. I experienced minimal tactile feel through the fingers, making it difficult to manipulate controls in my car while I drive. However, the polyurethane material was grippy enough for steering wheels.

The Velcro strap gets in the way because I cannot keep it on the loosest setting without the Velcro sticking to other clothes. It would have been better to use a ""fast fit"" style cuff. That said, the material definitely blocks out cold wind, and the insulation is good down to around 30 degrees. Any colder may require thicker insulation or liners.

UPDATE: 4 APR 2014
I have successfully used these gloves with the touch-screen system on my Ford, which has MyFord Touch and touch buttons for the HVAC controls as well as touch buttons for the door and keyless entry pad. The glove works through all of these systems, but the HVAC MyFord Touch buttons require a better connection (meaning - I have to push my finger against the glove as hard as possible for the capacitive control to work).

The wind resistant material works as advertised, but the cuff area will expose some of the wrist. It is not as well insulated as I'd like, because at -10F up to 20F, my fingers and hands will feel numb.

The polyurethane palm and finger material isn't very durable. It is already crumbling on my index finger, and I did not abuse or really use the gloves for any heavy labor. It was used only to drive to/from work and for opening doors. The salt/ice/snow/cold must have weakened the material.

Overall: 3/5 stars - inexpensive, blocks the wind, has heavy-duty but stiff polyurethane layers for the palm and finger tips that reduce tactile feedback, and the Velcro strap gets in the way more than it is useful as a winter glove."
It is not very soft.
"Looks ok for cosplay, but I really wouldn't try walking with it a whole day."
"Ordered a 12 in case too small.  It fits like a snug 10.  Nice looking dress, but very heavy material.  Needed as a bridesmaid dress for upcoming wedding."
It's ok.  A little darker than pictured.
"Wrong color, and the material feels kind of ""fragile"". Fit nice."
They are ok they are kind of tight and hurt my head made small.  I will have to try to find another pair that fit me better.
I would have liked these shoes but I ordered a B width and they came in a wide.  It took me a couple days to notice and by then it was too late to return them. The box said B but the shoes said wide inside.
Ordered a half size larger like other reviewers recommended and they were too big
"It's cute and well made, It was tight around my bust (34C, maybe D at time of birth) so much so I didn't end up using it. I wanted to change into it after birth to take out first family photo in, but that never happened."
"I purchased these sneakers two months ago because I have Hallux rigidus. The Olympus brand came recommended because of its rocker sole which is supposed to limit toe movement. At first, it was very good. But the sole is weak, and the ""rocker"" feature quickly degraded. By this, I mean that the sole softened up to the point where the bottom would just squish flat instead of rolling.  But my biggest issue is that the shoe is poorly made. After about a month the stitching started coming apart. The fabric became frayed. The tread started wearing down significantly. As it is, I have to repair the stitching around the toe box, as it had come undone very badly to where I can stick a finger in it. This is VERY poor quality from a shoe that costs over a hundred dollars. I used to buy my shoes at Walmart for $10-$15 and even THEY lasted at least 4-6 months before getting to this point (some lasted longer).

The wide toe box is very comfortable, even for someone like me who normally takes a 4E. Overall, a very comfortable shoe. Unfortunately, as I said, unless you have a lot of money to burn, I would buy this again."
"The same size as my other bibs, but fits tighter."
"Very long. I like the Kohls long tanks and these are almost a dress on my long torso they aren't very thick and the straps don't stay shortened, I find myself readjusting them all day long. I think they will just be my beach tanks from here on out versus wearing them under my shirts because they cause me to fidget too much..."
"I didn't expect the world's greatest boxer shorts when I ordered these. I searched and searched and searched for light, cotton boxers. Something basic. And I finally ordered these. Would I buy them again? Probably not. Why? Because of the dual seams in the rear. They are annoying and the way they are sewn they are felt constantly whether standing, moving, sitting - whatever. They work and perform their basic function, but I hope to find a better quality and constructed boxer, but then good luck with that search, right, since everything is now made in China, or Bangladesh, or Asia and the quality of everything in our lives has gone down, down, down, and down some more while the prices go up, up, and up. I'm sick of Chinese garbage. And it's all every American company sells!!!"
Cup sizes run skimpy and small. I exchanged mine and it's still too skimpy.
"The footbeds are terrific, as always. I do not like the straps though. They are uncomfortable and have not gotten better in the 2 months I've worn them. I have 4 current pairs of birks and know how to adjust them properly. These cannot be made comfortable on the top of my foot."
These shoes are a bit bulkier than I expected them to be though they definitely keep my feet dry and warm!
"This review is a little bias because the shoes just didn't fit me very well.  If you have wider feet, these will probably not work for you.  They were too narrow for me and my feet felt too snug on the sides.  The sole doesn't provide much support, it is a standard foam sole that you would find in a regular sneaker.  The price does not justify the quality of the shoe."
"I love some other dresses from this seller/manufacturer. Tjis was not 1 of em'. Quality is not great. For $30'ish dress it's fine..but ithers from tjis in tvat price range were way nicer. But Medium fit great, I norm.wear a sz. 8."
Cute well-made a little bigger than what I thought they were going to be I'll probably give them away
"The shoes are very soft, However they loosen up quickly and have no support. After a few hours my knees and ankles start to hurt."
They are cool but they really don't fit small children's shoes...especially if they have narrow feet. I really like the concept though!
I love the corset but I had to exchange it for a large. It is great quality and the shipping was fast.
"Ankle was loose which is a bummer because they were super cute otherwise. If you're expecting these to be form fitting around your ankle, you're in for some bad news. The zipper was INCREDIBLY stiff, and there is a stitch that stops it about halfway down, which is a bummer, but that's how big the entire pocket is."
"These shoes are comfortable and true to fit, but they are not the quality I expected - they look and feel as inexpensive as they are."
nice fit but thin fabric
"These are slim fit. My son works out. While they fit his waist, they were form fit to his legs and behind."
"I loved this dress. Nicely made and good material.. Fits to size and is flattering on bigger girls.. I'm 180, 5'5 size 18 jeans and got an XL.
The reason for the three stars was because it came with animal hair (cat or dog) on it right out of the plastic.. Gross.. The lost stars were for the fact that someone else had already done who knows with it THEN I got it uncleaned.. At least pick the fur off the returned clothes if you are going to resell a used clothing item!! A washing machine fixes it but Yuck !!!"
kinda cheaply made and the glass has come unglued...but it is ok for now.
"The plastic is thin and tears easily; the credit cards, license, etc., are hard to remove from the slots."
Amall
"I would rate these a 5 for comfort, a 4 for durability (they catch on everything) and a 3 for length.  The socks are different lengths and different calf sizes."
I would say these are just OKAY.....they are okay for the price but I would not purchase again.  The tabs fell apart on the first trip.  The next time I purchase I will go with a better product.  The color and styling is nice and its great to get a product that isn't the average BLACK. Very pretty but the tabs fall apart.  I am also concerned about the pull up part.  The 360 turn is great.  They are beautiful to look at it.
"It is larger than most front pocket wallets.  Also the it shines like patent leather, not like most most carbon fiber wallets."
Dots are half white disappointed  not the same as shown in the picture
Fits a bit tighter than expected however it is smooth and seamless
Does not stick well or push up the girls. I'm a D cup and see no difference when wearing them or removing them in my dresses
"I ordered the large. I am normally a large in compression stockings and these were so small on me I could not even get them to my waist. I would recommend ordering a size up at least. That being said, I tugged and pulled so hard I was sure I was going to tear a hole in them. They stayed their shape and never tore or ran at all. I will not buy these again because they are much too small for me."
I absolutely love this however I need a 5x. The 3x was way too snug. Maybe it runs really small. Mine was made perfectly no seeing imperfections. It sper light and airy. Just wish it wasn't so clingy.
"Not as comfy as my Utilikilts, but a good alternate."
Not at all as flattering as the other pattyboutik items I've purchased. Over priced for the quality.
These shoes were fairly comfortable but they rubbed a bit where my foot bent. I was concerned that they would rub and create a sore spot as my plan was to wear them on a vacation where I would be doing a lot of walking. I bought an extra wide but they were still a bit small.
"I really loved the look of these shoes, and they looked like they would be super comfortable.  When I tried them on, they fit as if they were a half a size too big, if I walk in them my heels slip out with every step.  The soles are also SUPER thick and stiff."
It seems more orange and red.  Did not match the outfit.
These boots were cute and all but had a hard time zipping this boot all the way up my leg...I'm 6ft tall my calls aren't that big but big enough to have issues with certain boots.  Hopes this helps
See thru so couldn't wear
"Product does have skid protection but it is an odd fit and not comfortable.  Also, not like any diabetic sock I own.  Not sure what makes it diabetic as there is no compression."
Way to small for my curvacious body.
This boot did not math the style  in product description. Ended  up giving  to grandson.
"Bought this for my wife, looks great but the material is cheap, this thing is not gonna last too long. Already wearing thin and hole are starting to come out."
Cute shoes but not the greatest material (can't really expect more at this price). Hated returning them but don't need a pair of boots that won't be worn more than once.
"Fun pajamas, but the red in the pants bleeds so much after just one wash in cold water."
Its okay works as expected
They're ok.... The bow is not centered at all
I bought her usual size 3 and they are alteast 2 sizes to big.  Shoes were of fair quality but they were VERY cheap.  Shipping from the retailer was fast.  Will work next year maybe.
Its a good watch however the hard plastic loop where the band goes through has bruised  my wrist.
"THE shoes are tight, I expect they may stretch out over time with usage.  I can squeeze into them so I am not sending them back since I am located overseas...returns can be such a hassle.

They look great!  If I had not pulled up on my bike no one might have guessed they were bike shoes.
  I added the clips and they function fine and very adjustable so no matter how you prefer to set your foot on the pedal you can make the right adjustments."
"It's really cool looking and the T-shirt feels nice.  However even though it's Junior sizing it's still kinda of a tight fit.  I wish it was general standard sizing.  If I could've found this in the Men's shirt section I would've bought that shirt instead.  Still if you're a teenage girl, tween, tween male or something of that body type (slender, small, flat chested, flat torso overall, go for it."
"Its alright, but certainly not better then wonder balsam. I bought it to cover scuffs, doesnt work for that. Just meh and okay for back up."
"I liked the appearance and coziness of these slippers but they didn't stay on my feet.  My heels slipped out of the foot bed so much that the only way I could keep them on was to ""scuff along"" in them.  I do have narrow heels but I think many feet might have the same problem in these slippers.  I'm returning them."
"Order one size down! I ordered a size 6 since based on reviews, it fits true to size. Not at all! Also, not very comfortable."
"They are very well made, the size is nice and the stones are firmly secured to the metal (which is very smooth and solid). The only problem I have with them is that the color of the quartz is not at all like it looks on the picture. The actual color of this kind of quartz varies in lightness and color quality so I really thought I was getting one like the picture (which would match a ring I have) but the smoky quartz in these is very dark and dull like watered-down coffee. You can still see through it and see that the stones have a very nice cut to them, just don't expect them to be as shiny and multi-toned as the ones in the picture. The quality of the jewelry is superb otherwise."
"nice mask, runs small"
cute -  but too high a heel - my legs hurt after a while - not a walking shoe  - ok for a short outing
"These are ok, but they won't stay on very well. Most days I switch to pants with feet."
"I normally wear a L or XL if I want a baggy fit.  Based on the reviews, I ordered a 2XL and it fit like a L normally would, so definitely order up in size.  One side of the pocket had the seem coming undone, so that is the basis of my rating.  Otherwise, I did like it."
Not bad. Trim length. Relatively quick drying. Quality of construction fair. The fabric is fairly stiff even after exposure to pool and sea water.
"The leather is thin, especially the handles; lining is stiff and has a smell; for traveling on a plane, it's ok; will not use it for dining out, however; too cheap looking. Thinking about returning it."
Okay.  Bought for walking and the padding was just alright.
"Looks ""plasticy."""
Too small by 2 sizes. I'm glad I was a prime so I sent it back and the return was easy.
"Looks good but ok quality.... loose cap, keeps slipping out of head"
"These shoes have a leather upper with no seams around the toes, which is a big plus to me because sometimes sneakers with stitching around the toe box rub and irritate my little toes.  No problem with that.  The toe box has plenty of room, too.

These shoes fit very well.  The tongue is gusseted with elastic fabric.  This keeps it in place, and I hoped it would prevent pressure on my instep.  It's difficult to find shoes with gusseted tongues, but I've owned them before and that feature made the shoes very comfortable.  In the case of these shoes, however, though the gussets keep the tongue from sliding around, I still get pressure on my instep.

When I first wore them, I thought I'd wind up returning them.  The sole has very little flexion and my feet felt a bit bound.  But they are leather, and after I wore them a few times, they ""broke in.""  What I mean is, the leather stretched some, allowing my feet to flex a bit.

The heel is a bit wide, and a little bit too low.  Like many people, I tend to put my weight on my heels, especialy when I'm tired.  Due to the shape and shallowness of the heel, I must make a concerted effort to center my weight properly.  There is good arch support, as well as heel support, though the heel support is diminished due to the aforementioned flaws.

These shoes are good for walking, but ironically, not so good for lateral movement.  The heel slippage and instep pressure cause foot fatigue.

If you're looking for a well made pair of white leather sneakers just for walking about, these are fine.  But if this is not your primary objective, look elsewhere."
"You get what you pay for.
The metal chain is a lot shorter then what is shown in picture.
Basically a cellphone bag. Can't really fit much else in there.
Comfortable to wear though."
Good running shoes but doesn't last very long.
This sweatshirt is pretty good but thinner than expected.  I am comparing it to another brand I bought recently and it is looser and thinner.
These were suppose to be slim but they were actually wider than the peri jeans that I have.
"So I'm a pretty honest person and that will show here. The shirts logo was printed on really good, but the overall quality of the tank is very stiff. Even after a couple washes it feels stiff. It's fits as expected, so it has that going for it."
"The sandals are lovely, except that the ankle part is so wide, that I don't think I can keep them :'(  I guess if you have ""cankles'"" they would fit better. Other than that, they are fine!"
"The print is very catchy and looks really good. The two issues as other people have mentioned is the unfinished hem and the big shorts that are attached to the suit. I would have preferred a regular swimsuit beneath the skirt. The biker like shorts bunch up.
It is hard to find a good suit but it is for the price a good deal."
"It's a nice-looking robe.  However, even though the tag says ""Cotton"" it really appeared to be something else.  It's a very heavy material and a robe appropriate for winter and not a summer cotton robe, which is what I was expecting and wanted.  It'll just hang in my closet until colder temperatures arrive."
"I wanted to like these so badly! I have another pair of Ahnu shoes that fit well and are very comfortable (but stink to high heaven) so I was hopeful these would work for me on a trip I have coming up where I anticipate a lot of walking. The look is really cute, a great cross between a ballerina flat and a sneaker, and the color (cranberry) is really fun. Unfortunately, I had heel pain when just standing in my kitchen, hardly even walking at all! I know the insoles are removable, but I have neither the time nor inclination to now have to track down the perfect insole to make these comfortable, especially after the money I paid for these. Ahnu makes quality shoes, which I don't mind paying for, but they should be comfortable straight out of the box. I was sorry to send these back."
"I only gave these 3 stars because the left one immediately gave me a blister on my ankle. There is very stiff material sewn into the boot around the heel/ankle area  and it poked out right where my ankle bone is and rubbed it raw.  I had to take a razor blade and cut this material away. Then I covered the area with duct tape. Problem solved.  But what a hassel.  The boots could use more padding to cover the rather sharp edge of this material. Other than that issue they are comfortable, but in hindsight I should have bought a pair that was more expensive and thus more well made."
Colour is as shown but cannot go out in cold weather depending on it as it not fitting and coming off  almost immediately!
Cute... I wear it at least once a week.
Had to return because I don't feel like it holds my tummy in enough.
It okay for the price.
wasnt blingy enough for what I was wanting for my wedding. Still pretty though
This bag works for what I needed but the flap magnetic closer things are not lined up at all so the flap dose not always stay closed.
sizes are really not right.
"Just received new shoes today. Sizing was off for keen shoes. Length was spot on but normal width or toe box was extremely narrow. Keen are known for their wider tor box, these are are not. Style and look and comfort are great tho. Have had keen shoes in the past that need a serious break in period  hopping these break in and loosen up in the toe box."
"I like the fit and style, but I am not a fan of the color. Unfortunately I bought the jacket because the picture made it look like a cognac color, but it does not look like that in real life. It looks more true to brown / does not have that orangey/cognac look to it. When it comes to brown leather, if it doesn't have the right tint, it can look fake and sometimes cheap.

If you are having a hard time choosing between the colors, I would go with the grey or black colors. I ordered two more of these jackets in the blackish/gray color (with the sweatshirt in the inside) and like it way better!"
"This is such a nice Henley, I am so sad I had to return it. It is so nice. I would recommend orderIng it a size Larger than you ordinarily wear. I did order a Carhartt regular tee which fit fine and I enjoy wearing it,"
I am typically a small size but there is no way i could get this on without ripping it and getting stuck. Cup size would be great/normal.
"I really liked the way these looked, but they were too small.  The Go Walk 2 in similar style was too big...more floppy! I really want some of these shoes, but am having trouble finding a style that fits well. I have one foot that is more than 1/2 a size larger than the other, so finding shoes without laces that fit is difficult."
good but too loose to the fit
Color is definitely not olive. It's ok for what you pay.
"The design looks good but material is very cheap and thin. Definitely buy one size up as well. I'm pretty sure once I wash this, it will shrink and my son will no longer be able to wear it."
"For years and years I carried its namesake ""granddaddy"" until it fell apart.  Aware that most products' qualities downgrade over time, I checked the Amazon reviews and learned this was true:  those who carried ""The Reaction"" for the first time were fairly pleased; those who once carried the older version (with two money pockets and with card pockets larger by about 2mm) were a little bit let down.  As was I.  I had to select and remove several cards that I have purposely carried in my Kenneth Cole wallet for a long time.  Too bad.  I almost ordered another brand but trusted my older left rear pocket friend.  Hope springs eternal, you know:  ""Mine is going to be a good replacement.""  Learned the hard way once again."
"I'm a Breckelle's boot addict.  Have not been unhappy with any boots from them, then I bought these.  Comfortable, yes. But buy a half size larger that what you normally wear, as with the Outlaw 13 Knee High boots, these run a tab bit small. Cute, yes...jeggings, leggings,
Jeans~skinny tucked in, or straight/boot cut wearing over, or with skirts, you will get tons of compliments.  I got the green after the green knee high I had been debating on buying sold out. But, what the hey, spring is trying to come in so the timing works for shorter boots. In case you are considering the green, these are the perfect shade, not bright as Emerald, not dark as military, not ..ick...pea green.  They remind me more of a sun covered mossy green.  Laces could have been a bit shorter, but Breckelles isn't known for normal length laces.  The scalloped top is very cute, and that is part of what will get the most comments on.  It's also one of two reasons they are rating a 3 from me,who normally puts Breckelles at 5. If your ankle is small, you are wearing these alone..meaning no (L) (J) eggings, pants, jeans tucked in, these  have to be tied a
bit tighter than with one of those tucked in (duh, that's pretty obvious~ yes, yes, I know I'm stating the obvious. Lol) however, when tied tight on. Bare leg it throws off the scalloped look. The front sort of ...scrunches in on itself, the two sides can really cross over each other in front and it just throws the look off. Yes, you'll still get compliments, but if you are a person that wants clean lines, wants the top to look as in the pic, not gonna happen with a skirt, even wearing tights, and who wants anything under the skirt in spring and summer...just too hot spending where you live. Summer I live in the 102 - 114 degree range. I want my boots with nothing but a barely there ankle sock.  Again, cute, but for picky boot addicts like myself, that little detail drives me crazy pairing these with skirts, dresses, and if wearing under straight leg instead of boot cut slacks or jeans, they push against them .  Second reason for earning a 3 star.  These do NOT offer anything in the way of traction.  After you've worn them while walking on cement, asphalt, and scratch up the bottom ,  they don't slide as easily on uncarpeted flooring as easily as when new, but still offer little in traction.  Would I buy them again, knowing all this? No. Main reason for me, I need the traction
as walls grow, furniture shifts , floors roll if they know it's me walking in their direction, yes I'm a klutz.  Will I continue to wear them, oh yes..but with jeggings and skinny jeans. Would I recommend them?  IF inanimate objects attack you, your work place or  house has mainly Marble, Tile, or wood flooring...you plan on these being your Go To boots for your Spring and Summer skirts and dresses...  No.  If you have no issue staying upright when walking, have thicker ankles, imperfect lines don't bother you, and like me, if you were looking for a specific color of boot in just below the calf hitting, combat style boots, and this style has that color, no one else seems to make...then. Yes, buy them. They are all day comfortable, they are easy to get off and on, the price is great, the shipping time amazing, they are well made, look a LOT  more expensive than what you're paying for, and last but not least, one can never have too many boots."
Ive always loved Kerusso shirts but theyve changed from Gildan shirts to Fruit of the Loom. They are way thinner now. Please change back asap.
"The problem is each color seems to have been made to different specifications. The grey is fine, with broad, comfy elastic waist, the pink is skimpy, with narrow, tight, not-very-stretchy waist. Both will fit, but one is more comfortable, and the pink feels a size too small all over, less forgiving a knit, among other problems."
Little cheap
"This is good for people with long torsos and necks.  I'm going to end up pulling the skirt up at the waistband and sewing it and then cutting a slit in the neck and folding the neck in to form a triangle at the bust.  Still, it's a steal and I got the package SUPER quick!  Definitely planning on ordering from this seller again."
"Bigger than I thought, but well made and comes with extra backings."
It has sort of a cup for your penis and the material touches your balls which is not very comfortable. I will be returning.
This top is very pretty but the armholes are cut too small. I will re-gift to someone it will fit
Cute watch for casual days. Is a little big on me but I have small wrists and most watches have to have quite a few links removed in order to fit me properly. Good watch if you're looking for something different.
"These undies are OK, but they do not have enough 'hold-in' power for me.  I would like them to be a little more snug-fitting (maybe I should have gotten a size smaller).  Otherwise, they are exactly as pictured - a nice 'vanilla' color."
"Had to return, too small. I wear a size 10 and it was too short and tight."
"Must have been a children s item, ordered and adult medium and came in  size of a 7 year old, company first suggested we keep and take a partial refund, when I said no, they agreed for me to send it back for full refund. The product seems to be of good quality, just haven't got any little ones to give to."
"Somehow got a hole in it after wearing twice to drive taxi, not exactly strenuous work."
"Shirt is a very vibrant orange color, perfect for Broncos fans. However, the material is pretty cheap and strings started to pull within the first couple of wears."
Tried to use this for my Batman costume and it doesn't go below your knee level if your 5'11-5'6. The material is nice. But this is only good for kids/teens. Not for adults
"Well made, great price, but it says ""fits all"" and doesn't.  I knew my hat size was a big one, but thought I would give it a try -  it just didn't fit. So, if you wear a large hat this may not work for you."
I was surprised by the size I have a small head and it was hard getting on you definitely need a wig cap with this to have it fit and look right
"The fit is a bit tight and the finger lengths.. Too long, I was looking for gloves I can use while driving. These feel authentic, like they are made from genuine leather, however in my case I needed more flexibility and these just didn't do it for me. I really wish they had different sizes. It seems like a great bargain, but it could also be that the price is marked intentionally. Either way, ive felt these gloves in my hands and my honest opinion, they look good, they feel great, even has that leathery smell.... Only downside and the most important is that its not ideal for driving because the fit is tailored for specific hands.

I read some of the other reviews before making my purchase and the finger length especially for the pinky finger is not exaggerated at all. I would take a picture to show, but unfortunately I returned mine.

I wiuld love these gloves because they were inner lining was very comfortable except for the fit of course. These are also beautifully designed. I like the chic look and its so stylish. Its my loss for having been born with short pinkies lol."
Nice looking and lite but very little support.
Beautiful colors but it comes in smaller size. So if you wear medium then order large.
For some reason this sleep shirt ( cats pajamas) was much more snug fitting than the other two I bought: Pawsetively Tired and One night stand. Seems there is an inconsistency in fit.
"I don't love this product, it's just ok. I normally fit into an asian small size but it's a little too tight for my liking. it's also not like regular leggings with a panel on one side and a line on the other, it has a panel on each side which gives me a weird gap between my thighs when i wear it, i'm not quite sure how to describe it, but it looks kind of unflattering. would be okay under a skirt possibly"
Ordered an extra large. I gave it to my sons girlfriend that normally wear a small and it fits her perfect.
"I am a 5'8"" tall and had to have it shortened two inches. Became expensive jumpsuit"
The material is of low quality and very thin
Loved it but very small for size
"They seemed to fit fine when I first slipped them on and the quality was fine but then after about 15 minutes I noticed that they rub on the pinky toes to the point that they gave me blisters after only an hour.  The only problem with Crocs shoes is that you can't ""break them in"" like a leather shoe which stretches.  The rubber stays put so those spots that rub don't go away with regular wear."
I WILL USE FOR WORK WITH HEAVY SOCKS TO MAKE UP FOR THE EXTRA SPACE. OTHERWISE I BELIEVE I WOULD HAVE RETURNED THEM.
"Not real big, small difference"
Love the color but somewhat small than my other pair of blue jeans
"Fit was a bit small but not far off what was expected, Material is thinner than expected."
I love these shoes.  But they KILL my ankles!  The strap in the back bites into my heels and literally made them bleed after only minutes of wear.  Hello band-aids and Neosporin for the rest of the day.  So bummed...not sure how to mitigate it either - it's not like I can break them in and soften them so it doesn't happen anymore.
"Exactly what i wanted but as someone else noted, the beads go to the underside but even more importantly the magnetic clasp is really weak.  It may just be the one I got but it unclasps easily."
Okay jacket...very see through...at least worth the 10 dollars
"These ear rings probably deserve a 1 star, but they are so cheap that I wasn't expecting more. The posts are a bit jagged and hard to put though our daughter's ears sometimes. Wouldn't buy again unless I needed disposable ear rings."
"This is adorable, and I have no issues with the quality! However, it appears to have been designed based on the proportions of an Oompa Loompa. My son is unfortunately built like his father, so his legs are already short, but the legs on this romper are still too short to fit him properly. Recommendation: buy tall socks with this item."
I did like this outfit but returned because it was see through
"Be warned: the 22inch does not expand!  I bought this case for an international trip.  I am a very light traveller and this case is for two people.  I read all the details and figured we would fit nicely with a little room for shopping.  It arrived yesterday, I excitedly started to pack and everything just fits......just.  So, I decided to expand the case to see how much extra room there was.  Unfortunately, despite the description, the 22inch case does not expand.  I would return it, except that I leave in a couple of days and I already recycled the box.  Not sure what to do.  Otherwise the case looks good and reasonably well made."
stopped working in 1 hr
"Attractive enough but smells like a rat died inside.  Horrible and unuseable.  I have it sitting open to air out and have tried deodorants and perfume to help, but it is sickening.  If it can air out and lose the smell I will enjoy it, but if not, it goes into the trash.  It is attractive and big enough  to be of good use."
"put a pair on and thought ......these should be snug fitting not loose boxers. anyone buying these.....if the size graph tells you to buy medium , trust me , buy small."
"Don't try to get the shipping wrinkles out yourself, had to take it to the cleaner to have the
Shipping"
"Per Amazon, a three star review means ""it's okay"" and that's exactly my opinion of this product. It's okay. Just that. Not great, not bad, just okay. It basically reminds me exactly of the type of concealer I used obsessively in junior high any time I had a red mark/possible pimple on my face. As you can see, it goes on with a doe foot applicator, and it's a thin liquid. For me, what this meant was that it didn't really conceal anything. On red marks, it was as though I wasn't using anything. With the bags beneath my eyes, it improved the situation mildly - but with my Tarte concealer, it's as though I slept a full night, I look that refreshed."
"These seem very durable. They are much heavier than I thought they would be. I don't really like
flip flops but needed these to wear in the shower when I was on vacation. They are so heavy and clunky I doubt
I will wear them for more than that."
"like some of the other reviewers, I have worn Carhartt workshirts for years. The old ones were 5.5 ounce cotton. The new ones are much lighter, 4.5 ounce. They don't wear or wash the same. I wish Carhartt would get out of China and go back to quality."
"Runs a little small, good quality for a costume."
THE ONLY REASON I AM ONLY GIVING 3 STARS...WHEN YOU WASH THESE (ACCORDING TO THE PRODUCT DIRECTIONS-HAND WASH...COLD...LAY FALT TO DRY) THEY SHRINK...I CAN STILL WEAR THEM...BUT...I AM BARELY 5' TALL...SO IF YOUR TALL...I WOULDN'T BUY THESE.  THAT BEING SAID...THEY ARE THIN...PERFECT FOR LAYERING...WHICH IS WHAT I WANT...I WANTED THEM LONG...BUT THEY WILL STILL WORK.  THEY ARE WELL MADE AND THE COLORS ARE TRUE TO DESCRIPTION.  ALL IN ALL...WORTH THE PRICE.
"The dress fit ok, but it was not the same when I checked it online."
"Fairly poorly made.  After about 6 washes, these have shrunk a lot (more than other brands) and now I don't really like wearing them.  I might try another pair in a size larger.
-Con-
-has a rubbery tag in the back that sticks to you after a while.  I tore mine off.
-the button in the front doesn't lay down well anymore - hangs open (annoying).  My other brands don't do that."
"I really enjoy this shirt...it's a bit see thru, BUT nothing that would prevent me from wearing it to the gym, etc"
"Not as padded as I hoped, but cute."
For the money I guess it is ok. The parts are cheap and you have to be careful you don't brake them when using them. You also have to leave it laying flat or all the parts just fall out of the holders. Does not make it easy for caring around.
"You get what you payfor.  Its not the greatest basketball shoe, but it will work.  This is exactly what I was looking for.  Everyone is right, it fights about 1/2 size smaller then what you normally wear"
"pretty small, for a man's head.  Did the trick for a costume, more or less."
Disappointed they are not as comfortable as other Algeria shoes I have purchased.
"The Clarks flip flops arrived right on time and they fit fine (11 M). Sadly, after wearing them all day I now have a sore spot on the top of my feet.  I cant wear them for more than an hour a day, because that sore spot hurts!!  . The straps are of little use to me, but maybe someone else with wide feet can adjust to widen the the shoes.  Im going to keep them and only wear them for 30 to 60 minutes a day."
The color was a pale pink not the bright pink shown.
"Very beautiful  shoe with extremely high arch. I wear heels all the time, however,  this shoe has no platform  for support.  Very difficult to walk in. I have flat feet so maybe that could attribute to the discomfort.  True to size. The size 8 was perfect fit. Normally I  wear an 8 or 8.5 US.
Returned  with no problems."
"I ordered them after reading some good reviews. My foot size is 9 to 9-1/2 width D, and I have a fairly high arch. As result they are a little too snug and my foot doesn't go into them far enough. Also, they don't align well with the foot. maybe stretching of the arch strap would help, if i can get someone or a tool to do it. I tried driving a car with them, and guess what? When your foot is on the gas pedal, the slipper comes off. They are O.K. for the beach, or inside the house, but I certainly wouldn't take long walks or hikes wearing them, (as some reviewers have indicated). Inside the house, they are O.K. on the carpet, but quite noisy on hardwood floors (being made of hard rubber). If they fit your feet ideally ""more power to ya!"", but in my case I need something with adjustable arch strap, and possibly something with an ankle strap."
"I ordered 2 pks of these. 1 pk was the actual fruit of the loom camis, the other was another brand made of nylon."
the heel caps have worn off after less than 2 months of use.
"These shoes are very comfortable and really help my neuropathy. This pair, likely not the norm, is wearing faster than normal. This is my second pair and I highly recommend these shoes for comfort."
"I have to admin I was very underwhelmed when these came. Regardless of the actual size measurements posted, the photos that are all over make these packing cubes in all kinds of colors look huge.  Instead they are very small.  I suppose it is actually my fault because I have looked at these so many times and when they were being offered at a really low price as an add on I jumped at the deal.  I was actually wanting to fill these and keep them under my bed but they are just not big enough to store much.  Don't get my wrong they are most likely perfect for putting your things in to separate in your suitcase or carry on (maybe shoes? socks undergarments) but I am glad I only paid 1/4 of the price they are asking for regularly because it was an ""add on"" deal.  The material kind of reminds me of a windbreaker.  They seem to be pretty sturdy and when I travel again I will probably take them with me to put presents in so the kids don't see it as soon as I open my suitcase or to pack my extra shoes away instead of using a plastic bag.  Do not expect something big like I did or you will be disappointed.  The large is about the size of a laptop but higher.  They are really not bad just not what I was expecting."
Ms o menos
Have not wore much!
I love SANUK and the product and quality they are but I own a few pairs and 2 of them are the same style; just different color. The psi I just recieved is a lot right her than the precious one purchased but I still wear them
"Definitely on the cheaper side. They were much taller than I was expecting, won't be returning because they are cute just not sure when I will wear them. Was intending them to be a work heel, but I do not think I would last all day in them."
"the height of the sox is somewhat low for a crew even though it is clear it is ""short"" the weave is also rather weak as I have had two already starting to unravel."
It has a nice simple design but the quality is bad... Should've read the reviews first...
"Very thin, low quality. Cheap, so acceptable, but wouldn't suggest for more than one or two trips."
These are not very feminine and they run rather tight. I do believe they are high quality though.
"While the length is correct, my sis were unable to wear it as her feet could not slide in. The opening size is fixed and there is no way to enlarge it to allow the feet to slide in. So, if your top of your feet is high (hence larger circumference) avoid this model and go for the normal Onitsuka.

Luckily someone else was able to wear this shoe and manage to slide in albeit with a bit of push. Definitely not for someone with a high top arch(?) - sorry. don't know the correct terminology for this."
"These are just ok, not great but not terrible.  I was hoping for a little more support, but my instep hurt me after wearing them all day.  My orthoheel sandals are much better, will buy them again next time."
"Very stiff and uncomfortable material, the print was cute."
"my daughter liked them, disappointed in lack of variation."
One thing missing ... which is in the newer version which we also bought is the ability to expand the bag.
"This dress fits smaller than stated. Had to do alterations when it came. Do not go by the bust size- not sure what designer uses to measure bust, but it's not inches like stated in the size section! My chest was flattened to almost nothing; and no material to do alterations, so we got creative and put lace under the arms to make it larger in the chest area.
Company shipped very fast, and was product ordered."
"I like the belt.  The quality of the leather is a bit light.  I bought this to replace my favorite belt which looks very similar.

They're OK.  I don't know if they'll last as long as the previous one."
"Inexpensive tennis socks. Pretty much what I expected, but could be thicker, more durable."
There OK but.... I don't know long the velcro straps will last.
"Superbly cool, good looking, great fit. Zipper is a joke! Broke immediately."
"These were returned, as the shaft was too narrow.  The C-D footbed was just perfect, and very comfortable, but I will need a wider calf.  Unfortunately, I did not see that these came in a wide-shaft option."
"Looks more like cotton stockings more than tights but they r nice.  Good quality,  soft and comfy."
"Jacket is true to the size.  I am US Medium to Large (I wear it sort of tight due to my physical fitness).  I ordered US L and it fit real tight and nice.  I don't like mine big so if you are looking to wear it with a bit of room, then I'd order two sizes up.  Jacket is ok.  It really isn't great quality but then again it's style is second to none."
"product fits decently, but the cup is a bit thin. Probably won't hide the 'headlight' look.  The back strap could be  a bit looser, so I might recommend getting it a size bigger if you're a fuller woman. but it wasn't too bad for the price,thought i might not buy from them again."
Fits but looks kinda like mushroom head
"the designs great, but the red was bleeding into the design when i received it. not sure if it was purposefully supposed to be like that, but thats not how it looks in the pic"
Product as described but too tight across my chest.  So disappointed.  I like matching items but this won't work
I purchased this product for my hubby. The price is quite reasonable but the holder is extremely bulky so of course it was not a hit with him.
"No matter how many times I set this watch, the day and date are never correct!  Grrrrrr!

I have bought similar watches without the date and have had no problems with the watch itself.

Replacing a watch I have owned about 6 months.  Strap broke after 6 months."
"A bit wide at the back were they zip up, but they are comfortable for work and an evening out, but I have a narrow foot.  I would not wear these if I were doing a lot of walking. Look good, great price.  Prompt delivery"
They do the job for cheap cheap sunglasses. everytime i touch them you can here the plastic.
About a size too small and narrow.
They don't look like the picture at all and no one liked them and I sent them back.
The color looked much brighter in the picture but it's very lighter shade in real. The flower looks nice but with the light color you can see the threads hem as other reviewers said.
"Looks great on, but not very comfortable.  The material is sort of scratchy without any give."
I like this shirt...just wish it was a little longer.
"Once I get these on, the comfort, fit, and durability are great. But getting them on is another matter. It is the correct size (11) and fit right once I get them on.  I finally bought a long shoe horn as I kept crushing down the back and my finger wasn't enough to hold the heel part open enough to fit my heel in. Once they are on, however, you don't have to worry about them slipping off when going up and down hills. Also warm in snow and cold temperatures. I won't buy them again, due to the difficulty getting them on, but that may just be me."
Yellow peaces came out before I wear it:(
"I bought this jacket for my niece's birthday. She generally wears a Lg. or X-Lg. I ordered an X-Lg. to make sure it was big enough, but when she zipped it up it was, it was snug. She is okay with it, so I don't plan to return it."
"Fits tight thigh up, too hard if you're trying to tuck in a shirt. Recommend buying one size higher for waist. Length is good."
"The clip came ENCASED in a seriously tank-like box -- a packaging ""feature"" that I found altogether unnecessary. Otherwise, it's a fine clip: it looks nice, doesn't stand out too much, but doesn't fade into the background, either. The one problem I've encountered so far (after several wears) is that it simply keeps losing its grip. Sure, it stays clipped to my shirt -- so I haven't lost it outright -- but even thinner, skinny ties get loose after only a few hours. This would be a great item if the spring were stronger..."
"These shoes have a comfortable footbed with memory foam that provides all day comfort. The front straps are non-adjustable and are designed for a wide foot. Since I have a wide foot I was pleased but they would be too loose for narrow feet. I wish they had been made adjustable.  It's great for people who stand on their feet all day but I wouldn't recommend them for a lot of walking as the front straps can loosen up after a while and the foot slides a little which can get really uncomfortable on long walks.

The ankle strap has a velcro but my feet swell during summer at the ankles or after long periods of sitting and the strap is too short, or rather the velcro does not come up far enough so I can seal the strap when my ankles swell. This renders them useless to me. Since I got them on a good Amazon deal, rather than return them I am going to stick some more Velcro on them. I just have to find the right color so it does not look bad.
Update: see pic I found sticky Velcro dots (for fabrics) at JoAnn in a similar color and stuck them on so the strap can be looser and fit. The Velcro dots are available on Amazon too, but at a higher price.

There is not much arch support on these sandals, but it's seldom that you can find any with good arch support. At least it provides memory foam comfort to my feet so they don't get all rough and chapped.

I will be using these as my work sandals in the summer as the nuetral color coordinates well with many outfits and makes them look less casual."
Better order a size or two up.  Not cut the same as other Hanes T-shirts.
"Looks and fits great, but the string used frays very easily. Not sure how much longer it's going to last (after 3 months of normal wear)."
"LOVE/HATE relationship with these socks.
Love the way it looks and it was ""breathable"" because they do feel thin for sure. Love that it's perfect for my VANS slip-ons.
Hate that my big toe already ripped through a new pair on the first day, when my toenails are trimmed and proper (I have great hygiene).
I gave it 3 stars for that reason... if it was durable, I would give it 5 stars... Don't expect these to last long."
I ordered my usual size 16Petite Short.  They were quite baggy and too long.  Wish I could figure out how to return them.  There was no packing slip to identify the item for return.
"I bought two pairs of Dickies recently. Unfortunately the carpenter pants we're WAY oversized in the leg area, though the waist and length were spot on. I feel like a kid from the 90's."
"They are light and comfortable.  I do think they run a little big in size compared to the average out there.  The ion mask technology to keep your feet dry does work.  Drop water on them and it just runs off.  The one and only complaint about these that I have is that they are not breathable.  They are made of a microfiber material instead of leather.  Leather breaths.  These do not.  After wearing these all day my socks feel wet to the touch when I take them off.  I do not have this problem when wearing leather boots.

I even did a test and made sure to wear the same type socks wearing my old leather boots and these new Magnums.  At the end of the day in the leather my socks feel dry to the touch.  At the end of the day after wearing the Magnums my socks feel wet to the touch.  I wear a wool blend socks that are supposed to wick the moisture away from your feet in order to stay dry all day.  So, for anyone considering these keep in mind that stepping in a puddle your feet will remain dry, but after long hours they will be wet depending on the socks.  My feet never felt like they were wet or sweating, but clearly the socks feel wet.  I have to wonder how long the boots will hold up given this problem.  Seems like they would rot from the inside out.

If these were made of leather they would be perfect !!!

EDIT:
It has now been 3 1/2 months and the lining behind my heel is wearing out.  I guess they are not perfect after all even if they were leather.  I have never had a pair of boots wear out this quickly.  I am not hard on my boots and there is no reason for this to have happen.  I will not buy again based on this experience.  I sent Magnum an email.  We will see how and if they respond.  Back to ""Made in the USA"" Red Wings for me."
"I like the quality of the garment, but it was much too big for my 12 month old."
"I have been wearing the other style of Snoozies so much that I wore holes in the bottom. I liked these because of the thicker sole. I wear size 9 and I have XL in the other style and they're slightly large. I ordered XL in these and they're too small. They pinch my toes and the elastic digs into the back of my heel.  Otherwise, I love them. Nice print, soft and warm, and a thicker sole.  But if I can't wear them, nothing else matters."
"My kids loved these shoes, expect for the fact that the fit a little small for the size that they wear."
"Cute but pompom has hard ball inside with very little faux fur covering it, a little awkward and wobbly."
"Shoes are very beautiful, workmanship and quality are very good. But the shoe is too small, especially in the front end is too narrow."
"Asian sizing, consider ordering 1-2 sizes up."
bought my size but it seems like it is very very narrow.....it is also short.....would probably have been better with the next size up
"Wore these shoes for an OCR (obstacles course race), they held up in the mud.  However, I have a really high arch, and they do not provide the support for my arch.  Would recommend changing out the sole provided for arch support.  The exterior of the shoe held up well for trail running and OCRs.  Washed off, as well as put in the washing machine for an extra cleaning and came perfectly clean.

Toe area - plenty of room. Toes are not squished.  I like for my toes to have plenty of room when running.

Heels have plenty of support and the back area doesn't run narrow.

The laces are very thin, which is normal with trail shoes.  Didn't really have to wear shoes long to ""Break them in"" like most shoes.  Overall, they are okay for the price."
"This bracelet is really cute but very flimsy so I have to be very careful when putting it on. It is not like the other
Alex and Ani  bracelets. It does look good with other Alex and Ani Bracelets. Hopefully if I am careful it won't break."
Tried two sizes and neither one worked.  Great arch support but thong cut into my feet.  Returning both pairs.
was worth the price paid
"To start off heels are heels. Either way you cut it, they're going to be painful at some point. After breaking these in they're ok as far as pain. The real issue was the zipper. Im so glad that i have amazon prime because the first pair I ordered came with a broken zipper. I immediately sent it back and reordered the shoe again. The second came with a similar problem though the zipper wasn't completely broken, the strip between the zipper and my foot was hanging down. I just ripped it out and went on about my night because I had to go. Besides the tolerable pain and zipper malfunction this shoe is ridiculously cute. I love the style and how it looks."
I gave this fringe scarf a 3 because it is very thin. It is made with very tiny string and not woven tight. I definitely will not be able to wear it while holding my children as it would easily snag. It will also snag on jewelry.
"I first purchased the black ones with the blue soles. I normally wear size 7, so that is what I purchased. When they arrived, I was so excited to try them on. Unfortunately, they were extremely short. So short, in fact that they made my toes hurt. So, I sent them back in exchange for a pair 1/2 a size larger. They didn't have the black in this size, so I got the grey and pink ones. No, the color is not red...it is a rather hot pink.

Even these are half a size larger, they are still shorter than I'd expected. My big toes still touch the front of the shoes but not uncomfortable so. I decided to keep them anyway. They are light and easy to slip on, which is what I was looking for. The band holds my feet comfortably in the shoes without being too constricting. I can walk rather long distances in them and not feel discomfort. Soles look like they will last for a while. My husband commented that the soles looked like the tread on snow tires.

On the negative side, the tops are made of material (only part way are they suede) and I am afraid my feet will get wet if I wear them outside in bad weather. They have absolutely no support. Although the inside material is comfortable, my arches were without any support. For an ostensible walking shoe, I thought this was ludicrous. I finally bought a pair of arch support inserts that I keep in the shoes. And, I am glad I didn't pay a lot of money for them. That's the reason I gave them 3 stars.

All in all, they are great shoes for kicking around the house. Once I put in the inserts, I use them as walking shoes because of their lightness and how the strap holds my foot in. Will I buy them again? Maybe....it all depends on how long this pair lasts and the price then."
"These are OK for what I paid for.  They are not high quality, but sufficient for banging around the house"
"Very attractive and classy-looking online and somewhat average looking in real life.  While I have no real complaints, there were a couple of issues:  the battery was dead and needed to be replaced at the time of arrival, and the instructions were standard for all watches that are sold by Armitron some of which have many more features than this particular watch.  That meant trying to discern what aspects applied to this particular watch and reading quite a bit of unrelated information."
but ok for the price. very thin however.
Not a big fan of these crucifix earrings. The detailing on my pair were pretty rough. The background of the cross looking like it came straight out of the mold with no care taken to smooth out the obvious defects. The edges of the cross were the same way. The figure details were also pretty 'blurred'.
otherwise beautifully made but just runs way too small
"This shirt is probably the best one that I ordered from this line - I like the rouching and double layers.  Still, it's very slim and I'll need some shapewear, but I feel if I go up to XL it'll be too big in the shoulders.  Wear an undershirt...I'm a D-cup and there is nothing left to the imagination when I wear this shirt.  Not exactly appropriate for work."
"This is a cute shoe, but I do not think that the quality is really there.

The outer materials are nice. It is a soft, leather feeling material. The inside is a soft satin. The shoe is comfortable enough when worn indoors periodically, but is not a shoe I can wear outside the home (which was obviously the intention). There is no support on the sides of the shoe, and it is so thin, that it would not hold up to any of the elements. I was really expecting a better quality item for the price."
"As a very large busted woman, I don't hold out a lot of hope for great strapless bras.  It's not super duper supportive, but it's not terrible either.  I wish the straps were a bit longer to be able to use one as a halter strap."
"Very long! If you want capris and are petite these are not the pjs for you!  I'm 5'2"" and these are like pants on me. They are very soft though, and I love the pockets and drawstring, so I think I'll try to hem them myself."
They felt kinda cheap. No comfort or support on the inside of the bootie.
"Cute, simple dress. It is not thick material, so If you are expecting a nice, warm winter dress, this is not the one. My granddaughter loves this dress."
"I bought this pith helmet to accompany a beekeeping veil. There is no doubt in my mind that the hard plastic shell of the helmet will prove to be impervious to bee stings. Although the fit is a little too tight for my fat head, I purchased it for my daughter and it fits her comfortably, if a bit loosely.

As popular as this helmet is with people buying their first batch of beekeeping equipment though, I'm not sure I would recommend it for that use. The plastic shell is lightweight, comfortable in the heat, and keeps bees off the scalp, but the smooth surface does not ""hold"" onto the elasticized hem of the beekeeper's veil, so it slips and slides as we work near the hive. That could turn out to be really problematic. A better solution would probably to buy a wide-brimmed hat made from heavy cotton duck or oilskin, which is what I did for myself and which works very well."
"I love this simple piece. I thought it was drusy, but it's not. It's more of a cut plastic. So, that was a little disappointing. I guess I didn't look at it close enough !"
"A good looking shoe, at a very low price. My son is 4, wore the shoe apart within one month. I replaced this with a different shoe."
Design was printed crooked (tilted and not on center) on the shirt
"its a shirt, nice but really nothing amazing"
This shoe is just ok. It is very stiff and hard to break in. It looks much better in the picture than in person.
"Got these after my pleasant experience with the Altra Men's Instinct Everyday shoe. They seem to fit a bit longer than those, in the same size. The tongue of the shoe also has some issues where if I'm not careful with my lacing and tying, they can pinch the top of my foot, which is very unpleasant.

They are very well vented, and my feet stay cool and comfortable, but the pinching of the top of my foot is something I need to figure out, and may just be something I'm doing wrong."
"They were alright.  I ordered them for an extra pair for my vacation to Jamaica. Unfortunately they didn't arrive on time, so I wasn't able to take them with me.  I tried them on when I got home from vacation, and I didn't really care for them enough to save them for this summer.  They fit properly, they just didn't have a really flattering look.  I returned them."
Love this design but the clasp is very uneven and sometimes does not want to open to take off.
not what i expected.  item was returned.  style and color was nice.  may look into it again.
"Like that it doesn't pill (it also does pretty well with dog hair), like that it's shaped, but it runs small I wear between a L and XL, ordered an XL and it was too snug. I had my seamstress put slits in the side and it helped a little."
not very comfortable and they looked better in the picture
Runs small but cute n comfy
"I got two pair, same size. The brown one fits considerably tighter than the blue ones."
"It was a little lighter weight than I had expected, and it was too short. I'm 5'7"" and it was mid calf for me, not long like the picture. I had to return it."
"The shirt is a solid buy for the price. Downsides are the material feels cheap, and the color is a bit too strong (also looks cheap)."
"the watch is very beautiful their box again came broken inside.
if not for that broken box would be perfect coming"
the top was really cute but the size was extremely small.  I ordered a XXL and it did not hold my breast at all.  I wear a size 36DD so I'm guessing this is just not equipped for me.  If they had a larger size I would reorder it but I'm just going to give it to a friend.
"They're wool boxers, which means almost no odor, quick-dry, comfortable, and all those good things.  They're often on sale on Amazon.  But they ride up the butt in ways that are just not really well designed.  They may fit you well, but they're good enough to wear not good enough to love for me.  NOTE: I'm a slender male, with a 29"" waist, and bought a size small."
"It's a well made bra,but I find the 40 too small and the 42 too large. so, I make do with  an extension. I don't understand why the bra costs $60.00."
tends to roll up. picture does not represent how the item looks on
Order a couple sizes bigger for loose fit.
I never used it and sent it back as it was not what I thought it was. So the rating means nothing. Did not use. 20 words.
"There was no choice as to length when I bought these. But, the length was listed as 32""; that works.
When the pants arrived and I tried them on they were probably a 36"" (can't be certain as there wasn't a tag to indicate); that doesn't work. The waist (34) is fine. For the price, I'll pay to have them tailored down.

The quality is good, and a brand I trust."
Good weight. I got it and immediately washed it then tossed it in they dryer. It has been in the dryer for 45 minutes on the hottest setting and I have had to clean the lint screen twice. This tells me it was very absorbent when it arrived. I hope there's enough of it left to actually use tonight.
Worn once and already a hole in them. Fit is good but these are super long. I am 5'6 with long legs and I have to bunch them up a bit.
These were bought as a gift - they seemed OK - I never used them...
They fit and are cute but they make my feet hot
You would never guess it's real leather until you notice the unfinished edges.  So I'd call it functional but is definitely nothing fancy.
The suitcase is very cute but after one use it already has signs of wear.
Width is fine but it is NOT long enough for tall women. I am 5'8'' and 135 lbs and it's 1-2 inches too short. If I raise my hands it shows the drawstrings to my scrub bottoms. Not pretty.
"The skirt itself is very cute. However, I the skirt is to big and does not lie the way it looks on the model. The skirt has way too much material and looks clunky. I decided to keep it anyway because I figured returning it would be a hassle and the skirt is still cute so I plan to tailor it a bit."
"Looks kinda cheap.  Flimsier than I expected from the picture, and not as shiny."
start of comfortable but feet hurt after a couple of hours.  they look very nice though and good quality.
"No entirely comfortable but I would buy again as I don't see anything else like it available with the stirrup feet - I hate toes poking thru the fishnets  - the material is durable BUT the first time I wore the net got tangled together on upper thighs and ripped. Still wearing as the punk look is ok for my purposes....but didn't expect that to happen on first wearing.  The stirrups are a bit lumpy in my shoes, but it's toleranble.  But with that said!  it serves my purposes and I like the larger net so would buy again"
I got 1 size bigger based on reviews but i definately reccoment 2 sizes  :(
Not what I expected.  Don't use it.
"The luggage it's self is fine.  However, I was promised next day delivery and that did NOT happen."
"Overall the loose sweater fits as expected. But, disappointed in the length. The photo makes the sweater looks longer in the back when it really cuts right at the small of your back."
Bra cups fit a bit too large.
They are difficult to see through. Mostly just wear them for show cause.. ya know... MURICA!
"My 22 month old grand daughter wears a 2T with extra room.
These are TIGHT!
I wanted her to have jammies since she spends Friday through Sunday with me.
Children's  pj's are $15 - $25 a PAIR!
I bought a pack of these and a pack of 3 pairs of pants and paired them up.
They are adorable and cost me less than $6 a pair with 2 shirts as extras.
I do wish there were more colors than the 2 & 3 white ones.
They are VERY SMALL compared to other shirts I just bought her in 2T."
"Once again a product that used to feel nice and beefy has turned into a thin, very light fabric, obviously due to cost cutting measures. The arms are a bit shorter than I'd like, and the fabric seems to have some sort of stretchy material in it, possibly Lycra. I was expecting a heavier shirt like the old school Fruit of the Loom used to be. I'd be willing to pay more to keep the quality of the older products that I grew up with. I am disappointed but not surprised. I don't think I will buy these again."
"This bra is comfortable, however it is not suitable for any low cut shirts. I bought the 44d, and I give it a 4 star for comfort but a one star for how it looks. Just very big and covers the entire breast."
"Nice, simple, good size."
Good shoes. Decent quality and comfortable. Especially for the price.
"It is tiny. I am 6.1 ft and it is like a t-shirt long. It looks great from afar, but it is a printed fabric. Good looks, but doesn't feel genuine, it is an imitation of a traditional dress. The fabric feels a bit plastiky, feels synthetic."
Bought as a gag gift to wear at an art opening. It was too messy -- the feathers will drop -- but lots of feathers in the boa. I'm going to repurpose it as the feather covering on a 6 foot tall crow.
Not overly padded or comfortable.
Smells musty
"I like G-Shock watches, this is my fourth one and they are all still running strong.

The quality of this watch is not comparable to the Shocks I've purchased in the past.  The band seems especially flimsy.

The watch face is really dark so it's fairly hard to see the displays.  The illumination button is small and hard to easily find by feel in the dark.  The button is located on the upper side of the watch unlike other G-Shocks that have a large button located under the display.

This is certainly not a bad product but it just doesn't compare well with many other G-Shock watches."
"They are pretty colors, feel good on my feet, but there is a very different and very strong smell that did not come out entirely in the wash."
"Had to re-lace it, but it fit okay. Wish it were a little longer though."
i bought this for myself (a slender woman) as mens flannel pants are nicer than women...even a small is too large for me however.  Won't buy again
Not exactly what I expected Gave it to my daughter who liked it and looked very nice wearing it.
I ended up returning this dress because the material is very thin and stretchy. I was expecting something a little denser.
"I like Fila as an inexpensive alternative to the higher-end brands.  Though it is a bit tight toward the toe, most shoe's I've tried on lately have poor quality control including the higher-priced brands.  I just don't tighten the laces as much, and the shoe feels fine."
not so resistent
Blister city!
review said the were a little large so i ordered one size smaller and it's a little tight
"Runs very small, however the fabric is very soft. I will keep this as I am losing weight and will make it a goal to wear it by the end of summer."
I asked my size without realizing that the cup was demi so there are somewhat small for me...but the color is gorgeous and the fabric is super soft and comfy...
"I liked the material. It is very silky. Loved the polka dots. What I didn't like was that when I went to put it on and tried to run my arms through the holes, the seams ripped from the back of the arm holes! I was devastated. I took it to a seamstress to have it repaired and she ended having to fix a lot of the arm seams. It appeared that the shirt was not properly sewn together when it was made. Beware, it may cost you more to repair the shirt then it is worth."
Kid wore them maybe once.  Wasn't real impressed.
"These are ok, but they are a bit loose around the legs and the cut makes them often give her a ""wedgie."" I like that they don't have the rough lacey edge, but The Fruit of the Loom style of this hem is a much better fit and doesn't wedgie."
Thought it would be a little bigger than it actually is. But it is ok. There is room for the toes to grow.
"I am between an 8 - 8.5. Ordered these in an 8.5..too big. The heel looks very cheap, but gave it 3 stars because the color is very pretty. found a problem with the wrapping of the heel..wrinkled and they are going back. Had my daughters try them on for an upcoming wedding or just for general wear. No one thought they'd ever wear them..same comment...the heel."
"Things I like about these stockings... #1 they are actually my skin tone... As I have gotten older (I'm in my early 30s) I have embraced my fair skin tone and I try to avoid getting too much sun (and my legs never tanned anyway). I have always bought the barely there color, because in stores it usually is the lightest color. This has always baffled me quite a bit because I don't really view myself as being pale, or porcelain... I even have a couple of friends with fairer skin.. but I was SO pleased with this color. They look nude on my skin.

Things I don't like about these stockings. I have only been able to wear each pair 2-3 times before they are just shredded. I'm not sure why this is happening, I buy other hanes stockings and don't have this issue, but the material feels less silky and all of a sudden I just get a big hole and there is no option of just spraying hairspray or putting a dab of clear nail polish to stop the run for the remainder of the day. As a bonus: since the stockings are so close to my skin color, it is barely noticeable when I get these catastrophic runs.

The stockings I have been sent are definitely not control top.... The package says they are... but these just feel like regular stockings at the waist...

This review started out as a 4, because that is how much I love the color... but based on the limited times I can wear them and not living up to their product description, I knocked it down to 3 stars... (If the color wasn't so fantastic it would only be 2 stars though). I wear stockings every week day... I can't afford to pay $8 every 2-3 days to keep me in stockings."
"I ordered a half size up, usually I wear 8.5 and purchased size 9, and I'm thinking I should have went to 9.5.  The toe box area feels narrow in these shoes.  The tongue of the shoe is kinda uncomfortable, it is not made of soft material.  The shoes look great though.  I hope they get more comfortable with some wear."
My one foot is wider than the other and the front straps were too tight on that foot. The leather was very soft.
Even though they say wide their still a little tight.
The shoe fit as expected. The box was a bit smashed and the shoes were somewhat compacted. The shoebox was in bad condition as it it had been sitting under other boxes for a while. I can't complain too much because the price was low for the shoe. Fairly happy.
Sizes run much smaller. Order at least one size larger if ordering. Othewise great good looking shoe.
"The design is kind of hard to see, scoobys' face is exactly the same color as the shirt so you really see eyes, tongue and collar. The shirt is thin material, hold it up and you see light through it. My son wore it for his themed bday party and was happy with it so it served its purpose for the day."
Cheaper looking than the pique polo fabric Carter's uses in their other clothing.
"Very loose, but its okay."
"These run really really small, even though they stretch. I bought a size up even after reading their reviews. They seem sturdy and easy to wear, once you get them on."
"I was happy to recieve them so quickly and the color assortment is very nice, but the only thing is, I thought they would be softer as I planned on giving them to my grandfather to use as handkerchief but have to re-think it as the material is too ruff. Sorry."
"I got this when amazon was having a sale for watches so I really can't complain.

The face of the watch is a standard size but I would have liked the band to be a bit larger. It looks small on my wrist and I am an average sized guy."
Text and design was add legible as hoped
They look good but are a little too short.  I'm 5.5 and 110#.  I'm going to have to really work at getting them on.  I would recommend them to a shorter friend.
"very still, hopefully it'll loosen up a bit with use. However, I got the 38"" belt, and it barely fits - so go one or two sizes up if you want more than a tiny sliver of belt to pull through,."
Could not wear them but seemed nice and comfortable if your foot is not narrow.
"I needed some socks on short notice, and just wanted to order them online. These seemed to be rated ok, and weren't that expensive either. They are comfortable, but they shed too much, as in there is black sock fluff in the sock or stuck to my foot even after having washed these a few times. I doubt these will last awhile, but they are at least comfortable while they last I suppose. I rated these 3 stars since they fit fine and are comfortable, but I am having doubts as to their longevity as others have noted. Not to mention the shedding too. I'll update when they end up wearing out."
a little too long on me 33 waist but it does the job and decent quality
"Tight in the thigh area.  I have to bend, crouch, and squat a lot during my day.  I was worried I would split the seams."
These really bag out. I suggest ordering a size smaller than you think. I can only wear these at night as there is too much fabric going on here for day time wear.
"The sides, of the purse  are unfinished. The whole purse should be the exact same color.  That's my only complaint.  It'll work, though, if you want to bring a pop of color to an outfit."
This shirt was very thin. It does not look as substantial as in picture.
Calf is too tight
I was under the impression that this would hold double the amount of pairs of earrings. This however was talking about one earring not a pair. I had to get another holder for the remainder of the earrings I originally purchased.
Cute top. Fit was fine. Pants are pretty thin though- almost too thin and feel like pajama material. Definitely cannot wear patterned/colored underwear under these or they will show right through.
"Dont work on point toe shoes, cant get in far enough to stretch for the little toe"
"Would have wanted to keep it but the toe bed was too wide for my medium to narrow feet. I think it would be best for someone who has a more regular medium size feet, just not me. Maybe another style just not this one."
Necklace is not the bright yellow color in the picture but it's still a decent necklace for the price
"Received the shoes and opened the box.
Grabbed the first shoe and placed it on my left foot.  AH... INSTANT RELIEF.
Grabbed the 2nd shoe and went to place out on my right foot... NOPE...
When it comes to dancing, I may have the proverbial ""TWO LEFT FEET"", but I honestly have no use for TWO LEFT SHOES.
Somebody is going to receive 2 RIGHT shoes in a size 8"
These don't fit like my last size 10 Smoothy sandals- too much of a hassle to exchange. I should stop buying stuff online.
I was excited to receive these boots since people mentioned that the calf was narrow. I have narrow calves (12 inches) and large feet which is a complicated combination for boots. My toes were squished at the ends of these and the calves were large enough for me to tuck my entire hand in. If they fit length wise I would have possibly kept them since they are pretty nice looking boots.
"These fit very large and I was less than impressed with the quality. Frankly, I expect better from Sperry. The rubber on the lowers seemed more like thick foam with an outer coating more than tough rubber for a snow boot. They also made a lot of noise when I tried them on/walked around."
Cute. Not loving the quality of Allegra k
You get what you pay for. I was expecting it to be poofy based upon the reviews but it was flat. The ribbon for the waist was a nice touch and it fit fairly true to size.
have the same one but different color
"Love the classic look and feel of these. I'm obviously aware that keeping white shoes white is an art BUT upon first washing these bad boys turned a weird sail/off-white color, and that was with non-colored detergent. So just walk on egg shells and you should be fine."
"if you have a low arch, these are the shoes to have.  if not - don't even waist your time.  you will not even fit your foot in.  Returned simply for that reason."
"Well, going by the reviews I ordered a size up which I felt didn't work for me.  I could literally snap the eyelets on the last row and it really didn't feel like it was compressing or pulling anything in. I thought I would get the look that the picture shows to give my waist a more accentuated look, and it didn't. The other thing is, if you put this on under a tight or fitted dress or shirt, you can see the bulkiness of the steel boned lines by the eyelets.  The material in the back is very bra-like/stretchy, the front is corset like and comfortable.  I normally wear a M-L shirt (depending on the style) and 38 bra, so again, going by the reviews I ordered the XXL.  I'm going to exchange it for an XL to see how that works out. I'm giving this 3 stars because I'm not sure if I like it yet...I'll update after I receive the exchange.

UPDATE: Bought another size and still didn't like the results. Just didn't work for me."
Not to shabby...
"My 12-year old was a bit disappointed in this jacket, although it really is just fine.  (I think he had something different in mind.)  The ""leather"" is a bit cheaper than I had anticipated, and the jacket does seem to run small.  My son usually wears a size 14, but this is just a tad small.  He won't get much wear out of it.  But, the price is so reasonable it's not a bad deal."
For the price I guess its worth having a extra set of lenses. When you compare the oakly lenses next to these you can feel and see the edges and how they were cut. So far the lenses themselves have held up but you can tell the quality is less than original. I would get again if I had too
it does not look like 30pcs but it was because i counted it the good thing about it is that it comes in different colors and patterns the bad things about it is that majority of the colors aren't cute and the ball comes off alot you will loose some.
"I liked the pattern and style, but I thought i was ordering a 2X women's and this was a 2X children's."
"I like these, but the material is very thin, I'm wondering how it will wear."
"It's a cute shoe - versatile enough to dress up jeans or compliment semi-formal wear. The bottom has a tough, felt texture to prevent slipping. Strap is stretch for secure fit. The sole is not cushioned, so budget your standing/walking time in these pumps accordingly. IMHO, the color is a little off in a good way. The picture makes this ""dark gray"" look a bit more muted brown. But what I received really is classy dark gray.

I was thrilled to find a 6 1/2 Wide (tricky size to find).  The size stamp says it's wide, but apparently I need a double-wide in this brand. Maybe if I wear them 20 minutes at a time, they'll start fitting okay.

I haven't decided if I'm going to return them or not. This is my 2nd shoe purchase online, and it's always a risk. But what brick-and-mortar store carries pumps in wide, half-sizes??

**UPDATE: tried to wear them to church...nit worth the squeeze in the toes. Returning them."
"Really pretty design but top does not cover enough.  size 38D or 38DD.  It is also the slinky/silky type material, I don't like it but seems other people love."
"I found these sandals to run kind of small.  I had trouble closing the buckle on the side and couldn't just slip them on. They're cute, but didn't work for me."
"I really liked this shoe and I was surprised the width fit me, considering I'm usually a wide width according to some styles or makers. my only disappointment was when the back of the shoe started rubbing my heel raw. That was painfully sneaky. When I put them on they felt fine, it wasn't until I walked a good way with them that I noticed how badly they had already hurt the back of my heel. ouch!! Being that they're otherwise comfortable, and they're were a bargain, I'll keep on with them and just put on a thick bandaid to avoid the pain in the future. hopefully they'll stretch out in time."
She only wore for a few days before it broke.  It was beautiful though and my daughter loved it.
"This shirt is very breathable, great for summer. It runs small for my taste, particularly in the shoulders/biceps. Would recommend getting a size larger than normal unless you like a tight fit."
Cute but tight at toes.
Not crazy about the material.  Not as soft as I was hoping.  There is no contour to the form so the shirt hangs pretty baggy rather than form to your body.  Won't buy this again.
"I was so excited to get these boots as they were exactly what I'd been looking for - a neutral low heeled riding boot from a supposed ""comfort"" brand that had enough straps and buckles to make it look on trend but not so much to be tacky....ordered in a 7.5 WW (the same size I have 3 other pairs of Naturalizers in that fit great) and I can't even get my foot into the boot it's so narrow. I measured across the ""ball"" of the shoe and it's about 3.5 inches. A 7.5 WW is supposed to be about 4.25 inches across [...]

It's still a beautiful boot which is why it gets 3 stars even though I can't get them on.

I'm baffled why so many shoe manufacturers don't make a true WW...it's not like a shoe can really be ""too wide"" (at least not like it can be too narrow - and if it is, you just get a narrower shoe. Instead, they have cut me out as a customer."
Not as durable as I thought it would be but my husband loves it.
"So everyone has been saying it's a bit small
And they are right. If you want it to have a bit of a ""hoochie"" fit then it's not bad but if you are looking for comfy ""pajama like"" fit then I'd say to even go up 2 sizes.
I'm 5'6, 132 lbs and I got a medium.  I like a tiny fit but I think I would have preferred a large. It's just a little too up my butt. Lol
But it's a cheap but soft long John material. I remember the reviews saying that the buttons fall off easily so i was careful with it and so far everything is fine.
I mean at the end of the day I didn't spend a bunch of money on it so I'm not upset about it."
"Product is as written, but I was a little disappointed with the colors provided.  I understand that it states that the colors may differ from the photos, but the colors I received were from a pastel, Easter rejects bin."
comfortable on first time wear. But upon washing the first time it started loosing threads and became little bumpy.
"Well made bra, but runs small sent back"
"We are on watch #2. The first let in water when swimming. It fogged up inside and when it dried out the indiglo did not work. My son likes the style so we had it replaced and so far things are good, and he's not using it in the water anymore. The buttons are pretty sensitive. Style is nice and not too big."
"If you are  Medium order and L Once. Nice T-shirt, looks really Nice..."
"I ordered the one size fits all for my husband which he generally wears well for costumes. I don't know if I received the wrong product or if a size Men's Medium is considered one size for this item, but it was extremely tight on him. He had to have it, or I definitely would have sent it back.

The costume itself was pretty decent considering it's just a one piece number."
"Size seems short
but good value"
"I like the style, but I was swimming in small (my normal size) when I tried it on. Not sure about the stain repelling claim. But it looks cool to the skin. The fossil is too light colored for me. Thinking if I should return it. I've already returned my normal size in Columbia hike pants. The reviews are correct; their sizing is a bit off.

--- update: I returned and replaced S, but now, even XS is somewhat large. Keeping because I have no more time to shop and I like the material."
not crazy about it  would not reorder
"I guess I should have known this golf-sized umbrella would cover the entire sidewalk as I walked Chicago. This umbrella is intrusive but solid. I like that it can still be compact enough to fit into a large bag. Doesn't fit so well with a messenger bag though. I expect this to make it through some tough storms, if I don't annoy everyone I walk past."
Have a flat stomache if your going to wear this
Bummed out the zipper came broken.
BUT ... I thought this was in an adult size.  I do not blame the seller.  I was not paying attention.
"runs alittle large just have to break them the hardest part very cute, nice colors good alround house or garden shoe"
"It is a nice chain. Bought it to replace one that broke and would cost more to fix than to replace.
If I had to do it over again, I'd look for something a bit thicker.
The price was a definite factor making this purchase for my daughter."
For very thin boys.
Great but not as warm as expected according to description.
"This product runs very small. My head is pretty tiny, but it's still snug on me. I bought it for a Jay (Mewes) costume and it worked great for that. If you have a medium to large sized head, this probably won't work for you. It is a bit overpriced; you can find similar items in brick and mortar stores for a fraction of the price."
Nine West shoes as well as boots run small. So I passed them to my daughter. They need to offer wide width.
"This is OK, but not sure it is real leather.  I think it is fake."
"I used to love these sandals, this was my 3rd pair.  For some reason though these kill my ankles and arches.  Not sure why they are different.  They are same ones I always wear just a different color."
"well its a little bit tight, but the colors and the texture are great"
Wish they came in half sizes. This way I know they would fit better.
Nice belt but not true to size.  Much longer than expected.
"This dress is really nice, just a little small. I'd suggest buying the next size up."
"I thought these boots were pretty cute, but they also look a bit on the cheaper side. The material doesn't seem too durable, and the boots themselves aren't super comfortable. I ended up sending them back. However, they're not expensive at all, so you get what you pay for!!"
"These sandals simply don't fit.  I tried them in size half larger than what I normally wear, and then a size larger.  I was really motivated to keep them - they are leather (and there simply aren't many alternatives to leather silver metallic dressy sandals), and look very nice.  However, the strap that goes across the upper part of the foot is too narrow.  This prevents the foot from being able to get far enough into the sandal.  As a result, there is space left in front of the toes, and the heel hangs off in the air.  I've contemplated in getting these in 2 sizes larger than what I normally wear, but decided against it.  Possibly these would work for someone with a narrow foot that was also shallow across, or with someone with very long toes."
ran a lil smaller than what i expected
Nice dress but the elastic on the sleeves ends was tight and uncomfortable. I've never been a fan of elastic edged sleeves.
"These are CRAZY LONG.  I tried giving them to my 6'7 brother, and they were even too long for him.  Also they make a swishy noise when you walk."
I'm a regular size 8 and these were a too small ): I was bummed for how much they cost they'd be more true to size. They are really soft though and I can imagine how comfortable they would be if they fit. Get a half size up in whatever size you are to make sure they fit.
Within a week the fabric under the arm tore. I sewed it up myself and now its fine but the stitching wasn't all that great to begin with.
Too tight in the arms and the collar will not lay down.
Left shoe felt like a size smaller...sending back.
"The skirt parts fits fine but the panty part is not long enough to reach the buckles without wrenching it painfully up my crack. Luckily it's an easy alteration , just adding couple inches of fabric at the crotch seam. The material is cheep & thin, as expected for the price. I am 5'9"" and 190 and got the 2xl."
"I stopped buying Levi's years ago due to poor quality control over sizing standards.  Buy 3 of the same size and Levi's number, get 3 different fits.  They stay true to form with my first pair in 10 years.  These run big but maybe a few washes and high drying temp will tighten them up.  They aren't a horrible fit but time will tell if they tighten up a little."
"This is a knockoff of a much more expensive dress from the Pretty Dress Company.  I wasn't expecting much given the price difference, but it was okay.

It doesn't feel quite as elegant as the pictures look, but having never seen the non-knockoff dress in person I can't compare the two side by side.  The print is accurate if a little bit lighter than the picture (the green is less rich).  There is a built in crinoline inside to give a bit of poof to the shape, but it doesn't do a huge amount since it's fairly thin.

The fit was very size accurate and there is a bit of stretch to the material.  I ordered the XL and it was about 21"" across the bust and 17.5"" across the waist.

I ended up returning this because it still looked pretty cheap compared to what I was expecting from the picture, but it's not a terrible little dress and seemed well enough made."
"It arrives in 3 pieces, and each of them was bent when I received them.  One of the hooks had fallen off.  I'm still giving it 3 stars because it's sturdy (so far) and I love how tall it can be made.  They really need to figure out how to ship it to prevent damage."
it docent even have a moth and the screen has like 6 scratches
didn't fit as expected. but it is a really nice dress
"I tried it on straight out of the box. It fit as I wanted it too, but it seemed long would of liked it about a inch or two shorter not at all like picture of model."
"thought it would be a sexy style dress, defiantly not. very long"
"My husband loved the boots but I initially order 10 1/2 and they were too small. The 11 fits perfect but they cost 40.00 more than the 10 1/2
I have received no response from the seller for the change in fee as it was done with in 1 day of receiving he first pair. That is the only negative I have and would like to resolve it and update my review."
The dress looks great.  But when washed in the washing machine it grabs lint.  So after every wash I have to use the lint brush it takes awhile.  But the fabric is durable and my little one looks super cute in it.  No fading of the colors.  I've had it for three months and use it once a week.
"I bought it for my husband, who practically is a mosquito attractant, we live in an area near the ocean, and there are many mosquitoes. He uses it but still needs to use insect repellent, using only the shirt isn't enough, mosquitoes can still bite through the fabric -"
Flimsy but worked for the costume I made
"my son asked for a pair of lighter brown oxfords for Xmas and after reading the reviews of this item I decided to buy them and had the coupon too making it a steal. I opened the box to look at them prior to wrapping and the front of the shoe is very pronounced as in long so I had to return them as I knew he would not like that. His prior Oxfords were from J. Cre* and were shorter in the toe box and a bit more preppy as he is at age 23. They do have a very nice cushioned insole, but the whole sole including the perimeter around the shoe was rubber with fake stitching out of rubber. I'm sure they would be very comfy and durable, but not what I know my son would like so unfortunately I had to send them right back."
"Fits well enough, not the way I'd like though. Rides up and tucks under the front. Was hoping they'd be a little longer. Washed before wearing and the black one faded dramatically. Super soft, surprisingly absorbent."
"This isn't constructed like one that I have from 30 years ago.
Its just not built to last.
But, it works well,, now."
"The first feeling from the moment I took the pants was: Why so heavy? After careful examination, it was because of multi-pockets. It's 50% heavier than  ordinary pants. If use it for outdoor activities, be reminded the day will be quite fatiguing."
Fit a little small. I wear an 8-10 depending on brand. I ordered a 10 and they fit but any smaller and they would have been too tight! They make a swishing sound when they move which makes them seem cheap. I only paid $12 for these so I would say they are worth the price but I wouldnt buy more for the same price.
"Comfy shirts, but shrink like crazy after washing. I had to manually stretch it out just to get it close to as it was when arrived."
"I really liked this anklet but I was only able to wear it about a month before it broke.  I did end up finding another one that lasted the whole summer so, I'd recommend that one over this one.  It's beautiful but too dainty for my needs.
Try this one instead, https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NMR6L2/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1"
Good walking shoes but not for long walks. The back of the shoe hurts and blistered my feet. Wear with socks
Flowers came apart
"It's a nice looking bag, but it's stiff leather that is lined in green canvas, and obviously made in China or Pakistan. The strap is very, very thin leather and looks like it will break in time. The ""smell"" reported in other reviews is there, but it is the smell of processed leather that is found in all leather that is tanned in third world countries. There are several inside pockets and the flap is a full flap reminiscent of old mail delivery bags./ It is a decent bag for the money, but it's NOT a Kenneth Cole Messenger bag either in look or quality."
"It was nice, but it is real wide."
This is a bit awkward and doesn't hang as well as I thought. However for the price and with some jeans it was still cute.
"Good shoe, like the new insoles..."
"I did not receive the item in the photo.  The shoes that I received had a Velcro closure on the outside of the toe straps.  I have read another review where the customer had the same problem.  They looked exactly the same otherwise, but this gave the shoe somewhat of a ""granny"" look.  I would have tried to make it work, but the Velcro on the ankle and the toe strap was too abrasive and difficult to adjust.  I was disappointed because this shoe was a nice height, and wide enough to walk in and wear all day comfortably. I'm typically a 10/41 (danskos) and could have gone down a half size, but it wasn't an option.  I returned the shoes.  I'll have to try again for a more youthful sandal from clark's."
"The garment shrunk tremendously upon first wash, and I try to wash everything on gentle and dry on low heat."
"I thought I ordered a medium width. That said, I could wear these. I am tall so I bought these for my nephew's wedding as I don't usually wear heels that high. These aren't what many would consider too high but on me I'm about 6'3"" with them on."
I prefer panty lines to ride ups. These tends to not stay in place but absolutely no panty lines
need to make these bags a little more sturdy.
Fits well. Looks really classy. However could not wear for long because the toe straps caused blisters.
Fits really tight
The color was too light. Not what I expected. And the back tab on the shoes was ripped.
quite classy..would buy again
"The ends came off and were lost at school the first day he wore them.
I do like that my kindergartner doesn't have untied shoelaces everyday, but these  didn't work well with Orthotics because you cannot open the shoes wide enough."
"Wife likes it, really cute, but certainly not cut to shape her body, kinda like her wearing one of my old filson or other plaid shirts, just not ""cut"" for a ladys figure."
"The handles are strong but are not reinforced where they attach.  This causes the bag to ""sag"" a bit.  Wish the leather went all the way around the bottom and I wish the fabric canvas  was doubled or handles reinforced then it would be 5 stars...it is beautiful however!"
"Returned shirt, since sleeves were too small, Also the color shown is not the color, beware it is a dark green"
"The S is way to big for me.
Nice bold colors.  True to size.  S of an iron on type."
Cute but a little stiff. Fit her wide feer
Very beautiful and comfy sole (padded?)
"Extremely comfortable; offers support and separation; is very nice looking.  I did not think I would be so pleased with this item because of the foam in the cups adding bulk. I thought I might just wear it under tshirts, but have found that it is very comfortable for every day wear."
High quality black t-shirt with silk-screened image of Joy Division album and its design skillfully affixed to shirt. A great gift or for yourself.
"My husband and I had been to every shoe store in the local area looking for the right shoe for me to wear at work. I was having no luck at all so I finally gave in and started looking for shoes online, but I was worried I wouldn't like buying a pair of shoes if I couldn't try them on first. I was very wrong. These shoes were perfect for my feet from the second I took them out of the mail and tried them on. They are sturdy, water resistant, all leather, and black. All the things I was looking for to wear to work. The surprising part is they are also extremely comfortable as well. Thanks for sending me great shoes."
Im so glad to find this! It covers my spots of thin hair by shading the scalp. Give it a try.
"Exactly like the pic, but this shoes runs BIG. Order half size smaller. Im a size 7. I have wide feet so I ordered a 7-1/2 rather than a 7 and it still was to big."
Colorful and comfy.
"Sexy. Don't know why I keep buying sexy underwear. My boyfriends get turned on. My member can't be contained, breaks thru and before you know it no more underwear and lots of passionate sex. But it is fun. Especially with new guys."
"I bought this bag to use as my personal item carry on bag.  It works perfect!  It's big enough for me to out my bag of liquids, my tablet, travel wallet, headphones, medication bag and metal water bottle.  It has a couple of smaller zipped compartments as well as a zipper to close the whole bag while going through security.  The leather is nice quality.  I would definitely recommend for travel."
"Great fit, durable material and a fun statement hat. I highly recommend as it was exactly what I was looking for."
"I already have a huge bag that I use when my family of 4 go to the beach or pool. But, I wanted something a little smaller I could take to the pool when it's just my 2 year old and I. I am so happy with the size of this bag. It is bigger than I thought, but not huge. I like the fabric. It is thicker material than I expected and well made. Time will tell if it lasts, but so far so good. I wouldn't hesitate to order a second one in a different print."
Very cute and sturdy and great delivery ! We love it !
I have been wearing this bra for several years. It fits well and has front closure.  Good for anyone with shoulder problems.
Thanks very nice product
"Ir is beautiful but too large i want small size.  I have one for over 7 years and looks like new and I'm using it every day for work , love this bag."
"Love these boots!  This is my tenth pair. Only issue I have ever had is the fabric on heal always wears out way before the boot. Never causes any problems but I still don't like it. Duct tape fixes all the issues. I have never found a boot that lasts like this with great comfort. Except military boots, but you can't get military boots with steel toe."
"These earrings are beautiful much nicer  than pictured.  They are a little to long for me, but my Granddaughter will love them."
"I haven't used it much, and so I can't speak for its durability, but it's cute and cheerful when the weather's dreary."
Love this modern classic bootie. They turn out better than expected. Can pair with a lot of things in my closet. Very comfortable. It looks great with both fold or unfolded version.
Cute and inexpensive. My daughter really liked it.
I love this scarf. It looks great for casual or dressing up. It's nice and soft. Fits great. I got this product on a review site for my honest opinion
"Great product. Easy to use, flap makes identifying information more discreet, but the bright color made my luggage easier to identify when retrieving it at the airport. Would recommend."
These are the first shoes I have owned that came with memory comfort insoles. They fit very comfortably and the width is great for me because I have wide feet. I also added some Dr. Scholl's gel insoles which makes these shoes even more comfortable and helped alleviate the back pain I would get from my old shoes.
"I love my new Keds!  They are perfect in so many settings.  I was really impressed with Amazon's price, they are much cheaper here than anywhere else I have looked.

This shoe is a classic."
"I love these boots, I wear them to work.  I do alot of walking at work and this is the only boot that I have found to stand up to the waer and tear and they are a great value for the money.  I would buy another pair."
"I cant brag enough about this. I initially found the brand at TJ Max and ever since  i have been looking for it online , found it here. I train at the gym , do heavy lifting 4 days a week , the material is still  looking great , cant see any sweat , and is so flattering for my body. gorgeous colors too. Recommend."
This is the best shoe I have ever purchased. I would buy it in every color. I wore the shoes all day and they were extremely comfortable. I love them so much.
My son asked me for print he's 3 years old and he loves it. Looks Vary comfy too
"I have always love the comfort technology that sketchers shoes have. Since i am a sporty kind of woman who loves to play badminton, running, walking, jogging, biking and etc., i always look for comfortability in my foot wears as my main priority and this shoes did not disappoint me.  The arching is just smooth  as it supports you feet as you do the run, walk, jog movement as you land on the ground. You can definitely wear this whole day long without any problems. Super love it."
I am more than happy with this dress and excited to wear it to my upcoming wedding!  It is a very flattering fit!
"So I bought 2 sizes larger than I usually do and it is still kind of tight.  It's workable, but I would have been happier if it was loose!"
"It's very cute, the handle does seem a little flimsy though"
Wife thought it was cute
"Nice shirt, good graphic. Would buy again from this seller"
"Great socks. Wore them on a roller derby tournament and they did great. I highly recommend,"
My sister wore this on her wedding day. She wanted something that fit well and she didn't have to worry about. On the plus side the undies are cute and flattering
"These are even cuter in person than on the computer. Very very comfy too, and fit true to size. Very happy with them."
"The earrings are just what I wanted and expected - nice and small.  I don't like large hoops, and prefer them small with a nice smug fit.  They appear & fit just like the product example as shown.  Also, the diamonds appear just as the picture displays.  The only thing is that I don't think that the clasp has a nice firm hold."
"I usually fit a small, but since my shoulders are 15 inches, I ordered a size up. If you have broader shoulders, order a size up. I'm giving it 4 stars because they sent a long sleeve shirt instead."
Fittflops my go to shoe for comfort ..never disappoints
Fits my 1.5 year old perfectly.
It is exactly what I wanted. I am pleased that I can either layer it or wear alone.
They are nice .
This cardigan is very cute on.  My granddaughter liked the peek-a-boo lace design at the back.
The pants looked washed out after the first wash. The rest of the outfit retained their color. So I thought that was weird. Never had a problem with items bought on Amazon before. Great that the tops are long so you don't see the pants that much.
"Comfy, a bit high in the waist"
I love it. Perfect for my needs.
"If the crotch had snaps so I could pee more easily, I'd give 5 stars."
"34b and the top fit me nicely in a size m. Bottoms were too big on me, but they seemed true to size (8-10). Very comfy and nice material."
The perfect Cat in the Hat costume.  It was not expensive and the quality of the costume was superb. The gloves gave it the perfect touch.  One advance the top hat must be stuffed with tissue paper to sit straight up.
real nice band...
I bought this for my brothers birthday and it came right on time and looked brand new just like they said it would I love this band so I was really excited
Cute and comfy. The fabric has a slightly metalic shine which is nice. Haven't tried walking in these all day but then again I wouldn't do that with any sandal that has height. I can wear these with practically anything. These are great for the price.
"I'm 5'10"", 254lbs and bought the 7x. Had a heck of a time getting it on. Bought the largest size thinking I'd have a bit of wiggle room; there was none. Can't imagine anyone heavier being able to get these on. That being said, once I did get them on (after much effort) they were very comfortable and durable. I've only worn them once, but they held up well."
"The perfect travel slippers---fold into a small storage case.  I may go thru airport security with these and wear them on the plane
Dave"
Good quality. Well sewn. Very comfortable. I would buy them again.
Had to have comfy ridding in summer
"its nice and good design for a simple watch that you can wear everyday, great for teens and normal dayto wear of anyone."
I was surprised when I first got the jacket because it was a 3x and I order a 0X. Then I realized it was made in Korean and that is probably the Korean size chart. But it fit perfectly.
"I've worn this one piece swim suit several times now and it's a decent, inexpensive suit that fits a longer torso and has moderate coverage. I like the mesh panel because it adds a slight sexiness without over exposing. The suit has thin modesty cups in the bust and the straps are adjustable. The problem I've had is that the pink dye runs every time I'm out of the water. It has rubbed off on my cover up clothing (but thankfully washes out easily) when my suit is still wet, or drips when I hang the suit to dry. Also, there seems to be an excessive amount of material where the crotch is, like it bunches up. I could probably have this area taken in but just haven't put forth the effort. The product was inexpensive, and I don't expect it to last more than one or two seasons, but I would buy another due to it being a stylish one piece that actual fits my long torso."
"I like it, it's looks good and suitable for me."
looks great. it's either a big watch or my husband has a very small wrist. we need to take out a few links but they are almost impossible to remove. tool keeps bending and no matter how hard we try the pins won't move. we are going to take it to a jeweler to see if they can do it because we're afraid of breaking the wood.
"actually, my wife loved them!"
"Was very cute but the top was a little small on my baby and she kept using her toes to pull the mermaid fin off. So I did not get as good of pictures as I wanted, but the costume was cute."
"I really like the idea of this product, and it functions exactly as it's designed to.  I considered that it fit me very well, and it was comfortable but it turned out to be a little too tight over the bust and caused painful blocked ducts when I wore it.  I am holding on to it in the hopes that I will be able to wear it in a few months without difficulty.  Similar products are available in Europe which hook over your shoulders but sit just under the bust and just cover your belly - I haven't been able to find anything like that in the States.  That would be my perfect solution."
"Watch looks nice...I have other watches in this price range, and the feel a bit more substantial, but I am very satisfied with this piece.  It looks crisp and clean.  The clasp has a good catch and feels secure.  The winding crown has a feel of a lesser watch but that is not really anything to factor.  The MSRP IS $499?!?  This isn't a $500 watch.  But at $200-$250...a good price for what you get."
"Fits a bit large, but perfect for mid to heavy boot socks.  I find them very comfortable and not too heavy with great traction, though I wouldn't attempt a hike with these.  Overall a good winter/rain boot for urban, work and maybe light outdoor use."
"If you are plus size, These are ish. I love them they're great but also too small for me."
"cute top , i love it"
I love these shoes.  They fit perfectly.
"I like this watch, it is easy to read and has a nice Velcro band. I would recommend this watch"
Soft and warm.  Just what I needed...
Bought this before I got pregnant and loved it. I've been using it pregnant too. Great product!
"I bought a pair of New Balance Men's Running Shoe 20 years ago when I could not find the Nikes that I liked.  I have never worn Nikes since.  This will make my 10th or so pair of New Balance and my OLD ones will replace my yardwork/beach shoes because they are still perfectly wearable.
(This was purchased by my husband, whom I love very much.)"
I found them to be comfortable. YMMV.
Nice basic cami that hold its shape.
"No issues during this transaction, nice looking, good quality"
"beautiful,fits well."
Cute and fits perfectly. Extremely soft and doesn't shrink after being washed.
I am extremely pleased with the quality of the Ema Jane products. This is my second purchase from this line for my daughter and the grosgrain bows are so cute and very good quality. Don't bother buying anything else!
Light weight and awesome.
"Good quality, lovely and comfortable"
"Stylish maternity swimsuit that provides good coverage. The straps don't cut into your shoulders and are comfortable to wear for hours on end. I like that the straps are adjustable, as well. Flattering design and cut! =)"
My favorite in my dwrar. Double macetomies with reconstruction. These are the best.
Nice item. Kids will love it. Don't like the Morphsuits butt tag though.
The product is nice but size Small does not fit as good. The size small is too loose for me a thin woman so I am returning the product. Giving a good rating since I was able to return and only problem is that the size small is a bit loose for me.
"Ok, here we go. I have been dying to do this review... I have a ring that is size 7. I have a ring finger that is a size 6-6.5 and a middle finger that is a 7.5. I need to up the size of the ring or reduce it but either way it doesn't fit. $30 to enlarge (or reduce) it professionally by resizing or $15 to reduce it with ""plastic"". Interesting concept so I figured... what have I got to lose. I have other rings that are 1/2 sizes to big also.

Well, I got the product and read the directions carefully. I bent the hanging hook up and anchored the card under a heavy book for extra stability. I opened the can and peeled back the film and looked at the contents. Relatively clear and sticky... hmm, ok. I took the ring but the face in my thumb and middle finger and dipped about 1/2 way in and sort of scooped it forward. I got a good glob on the inside and coated the outside. I checked to make sure the edges were covered and hung it on the hook. Now here is where I think people get into trouble. I left it alone for 2 days. When I got home from my weekend vacation I looked at it and it seemed flat inside. No glob at all. It had settled into a well. I put the ring on and felt the texture of the the product. It has a certain kind of rubbery texture that seems to give it some gripping power. Still, it is a little big so I dipped it again. Instructions say you can so here we go again. I followed the same procedure and waited 24hours. I put the ring on this morning and it isn't tight and has that rubbery gripping power and is kind of comfortable. I can dip it again but I am happy right here.

Now, you don't want to go rubbing on the edges because they will come up and will be rubbery ( I think the name of ""plastic"" they use is a bit of a misnomer) If you wash your hands, the ring will feel a little slick. Just take the ring off and dry your hands well and put it back on- no problem. I think this might last for a bunch of wearings. I don't intend to wear it every day. This is just a right hand ring anyway. I have lots of them. I have included pictures so you can see what this stuff looks like. You can see that there is no mess on the front of the ring. You can also see that if rubbed it will peel up a bit but I think in a few weeks after wearing it a few times I will just redip or peel the current coat off and redo the application. I hope you like this product. I think it is kind of handy. I don't like the metal clips you can install in your ring because they can come loose and scratch you and the plastic round things have a habit of falling out when I take the ring off or the ring slides in a circle on my finger. I hope this helps some of the unhappy people too. Try it again and see if it works better."
"Very cute slippers. Love wearing these around the house and I've been guilty of wearing them in public if I have to run out to the store. They are a little bit big, but not in a bad way."
My son loves them for work as he is on his feet long hours.
This robe feels awesome!
"Theyre dickies, good quality and good fit"
"Okay.. these were for my 80-year old mom, but I have two pairs myself and wear them all dayeven around the house. They were crucial in relieving foot strain. Comfortable, good support, easy to slip on...I knew that my Mother could really use a pair.
The colors / stitching combinations are odd...but they really are super comfortable."
good product much cheaper then u woulds by at the amusment part love them
These are about the only shoe I wear these days. Just wish they came in tan/brown shades.  Excellent arch support.
"4th pair of dockers, the only thing that needs to be fixed is the heels (on all types i've purchesed) tend to wear down quickly, hope this pair are better"
"Yes, as other reviewers said, they were a tight fit, but I did not find I needed to make any adjustments to them or the frames to make them fit. I love that I have working lenses for my Rudy Project sunglasses without paying the hefty price tag for R.P. original lenses."
zzzzzzzzzz
"This was a nice shirt I purchased for my boyfriend's birthday.  He hasn't opened it yet, but I liked it very much."
"I bought these shoes to wear around the pool. They run true to size, I suppose. I use a Dr Scholls insole and the shoes fit great & feel much better when I walk around in them."
Great costume for the price.  The leggings are baggy but I ordered some others.
my size M and i order L and large size is tight
"I love this Boot 'cos its light and feels confortable when i wear it, the soul is just too sweet."
"These bras are so comfortable! I bought black, lilac, and aqua. I do cardio Monday through Friday, machine and free weights the same days, and this bra sports me well.

It isn't too tight like most sports bras that can feel constricting on the girls. It truly is comfortable enough to sleep in, as described in the listing, should you choose to do so! The padding is slightly thicker than swimsuit padding/liners but not too thick where it is push up padding.

It has become my go to sports bra for its comfort and support I get. For sizing, I am 32b and the medium fits me perfectly!"
"Super cute!  After a year of owning them the piece that attaches inside has broken, but the ears still stay up & look great!  It just sounds a little crunchy when you put them on.  My kids still wear them all the time."
These are great shoes!  My 2 year old daughter wore them every day this summer.  They held up great and the multicolor design matched everything.  Highly recommend these shoes.
"I read a ton of reviews on here before I ordered these shoes.  I live in Missouri and the weather can go from 70 degrees to snow/ice mix the next day.  These shoes have excellent tractions, they are tall enough on my legs (Im 5 10), and Ive received a ton of compliments on the black/pink unique color.  They are easy to clean and VERY warm.  I normally wear a size 9 in all regular boots and heels.  I ordered this pair in a size 9 also.  there is a little room if I wear thin socks but with thick socks they fit like a glove.  I complaired prices on several other sites and this one was the best."
Beautiful Sandle Fit & Color. Love these wish I could get another now. I would not Hesitate !!!
"these short fit great, feel great and are a steal at the price."
Much easier than a pillow! Use it for many funny costumes. Very comfortable and a good length. Keeps you warm too!
"They are tiny - maybe for an 8-12 year old? Many threads show between the toes. Have no idea how sturdy they are - but as I did get them for crafts, am pleased they were inexpensive."
Soft and comfortable. I'm normally a 9-9.5 shoe size. Ordered 9.5-10. They are snug but will fit. Glad I ordered a size up.
Bought these for a friend. She says they fit great and feels as good as going barefoot!
"I love these boots. I've had Frye, Red Wing, Timberlands, the list goes on, and these may be the nicest boots I've ever owned. The construction and quality of the boots is top notch. They're simple, sturdy, and easy to dress up or down. They look great with jeans, chinos, and even wool pants if you like. They do take a little to break in and the soles are hard - these are not sneakers! They're boots! Also, I wear a 10 in Nikes, a 9 in Cole Haan and these I needed an 8.5. So take that for what it's worth and size down."
"Very nice, fit as expected good quality leather I really recommend this purchase."
Beautiful dress but way too small for me.  I'm 5/4 39-31-40 and the XL was too tight.
"My favorite cardigan. The color is beautiful, and exactly as shown. Lightweight and cool."
"I really like New Balance, mainly because they actually make wide shoes, and they fit pretty well.  Too early to tell with these, but my old pair of NB and the one before that held up pretty well, so no complaints about durability either.  The only nit-pick I can think of is that the shoe strings are way too long..."
The mom thought these were very cute.
"Very nice, but I perhaps needed a larger size"
"These fit well, are cushiony comfortable -- Bass has not lost their quality over the years; I definitely recommend these!!"
"My son wore this for Easter in the turquiose color- it was a fabulous color, very spring like. My son is a 2nd grader he is 8, however he measures more like a 3rd grader and wears a 10/12 so I ordered it in 12- it fit perfect! Even though he has extra long arms and is very tall nothing about the shirt was short like I read in other reviews! I feel like you should read the size chart carefully and purchase according to what you usually buy and it will fit as expected!!"
Looks great and nicely crafted.  Fits my wrist great but make sure you know you wrist size if you're a guy with big wrists.
"feels great
thanks"
"The top leather panel of these sandals is often regarded as uncomfortable and digging into skin. That is correct but also easily corrected with water: full grain leather (every kind of leather, actually) softens when wet. It then tends to give and yield a bit, usually enough for a nice smooth fit. If not, the size is too Narrow and should be returned for an M size of same number."
Very nice dress looks exactly like the picture. I just may have gotten a size too small? It fits nicely everywhere but around my shoulders. Overall I do like this dress and the quality is very nice compared to most laced dresses.
Beautiful bracelet. Very heavy. Delivered faster than expected.
Best purchase off of Amazon. Took this to my honeymoon and my husband loved it. It has been almost a year and he still asks me to put it on!
"Looks like the picture exactly, being Really small I knew it would have areas that hang so that was expected."
"These belts lay totally flat and absolutely, comfortably, keep your pants up! Even low-cut jeans stay in place much better. Now I don't have to keep tugging them up when no one is looking :-)"
"I ordered a size up because I like my shirts to be loose and flowy. This was made out of nice and light fabric, vneck was cute and it wasn't see through.

The picture is misleading because it makes it seem like this shirt is long when it's not. It's almost square. The shirt was ordered a size up for me and it barely touched the top of my bum. I'd like to order another one a size large but then the vneck would be ridiculously low. If you are not looking for a long tshirt though, then this is a good buy."
Loved this. The recipient also loved it.
My husband love it! but the type of work he does he needs another one! We may buy again
Purchased for son he said it works great.
I love these sandals.  I'm surprised I'm saying that because I don't generally like a white shoe but the strap up the front isn't white it's a beige (very light beige) and it keeps them from being glaringly white.  I'm really glad I bought them!
Nice swim trunks. Bright color and dries reasonably quickly. If you are between sizes get the smaller as they run slightly large.
Works in all weather 40 degrees or above.
My daughter loves this dress! I got her the size 6. She is almost 5 and 42 inches tall. She says the dress is beautiful! We got the ivory to wear at a family dinner this October on vacation.
Very nice and warm gloves and I can still operate my Ipad
"levis is always my choice, and this one is not that good, waist is alright, but to tight for legs, the reason I put it five stars is I looks good on it,"
Super cute. Soft and stretchy  material. The material was much nicer than I thought it would be. I am 5'4 and it is a little long for flip flops but I can wear with some cute wedges or hem it.  Really cute. I want it in other colors.
"Color was a little different than pictured, but this is by far the best Elsa costume we've seen! We own a princess party business, and all of our characters are beyond obsessed with it. As you can see the neckline/upper bodice is rather transparent, and there isn't as much of a color transition as pictured."
Bought these for my husband .  He has been wearing this brand for years and loves them.
"I have several jackets like this, so no complaints."
"same quality and color as the other pieces for this collection, great. here we go with more words again, please make shorter"
I had to take it in a bit but it's beautiful and I always get tons of compliments when I wear it!
Bought this for reasons I am not completely sure of because I am not a huge jewelry fan but when it arived it proved to be a cute piece of moderate quality...definitely would recommend.
"I like my new shoestrings.  Only negative is that the color isn't a true red, it's more orange red."
Very comfortable. My daughter loves it!  Right size too!!
"Very very very nice, finish, fit and quiet...Did I say nice?"
Straps are a bit too far out so they would fall so I purchased silicone strap pads that work just great. Very comfortable bra with good fitting and soft fabric
"I was skeptical ordering this after a few reviewers claimed they hadn't gotten the correct item, but took a chance with Amazon'a free returns. I'm glad I did. I ordered the black, and the stitching is exactly like the pictures, looks really beautiful. The card slots are all a good size and all my things fit well. Lots of compartments in this thing and doesn't look or feel cheap at all. The pleather is soft and the snap on the outside works perfectly. My only reason for four stars instead of five is that some of the stitching (while it's still beautiful) is already coming unstitched in the back, and for having just taken out of the package, that seems disappointing. Other than that, I'm super pleased with the purchase and will probably buy more in other colors."
"This is the second pair of these boots.  I bought the first pair a year ago.  They get worn constantly and still look new.  I had 3 girls in 4 years, and I have no doubt these boots will go through all 3 and then get passed to a friend!"
"Quality, fabric and color are perfect. It's a little tight up top for being so loose on bottom but I still love it!"
"My grandbaby loves them, they are soft and fit great"
"This dress is super cute, but seems to run small. My daughter is 2,5 and I usually get her size 3 which most of the time fits well or even too big, this dress is pretty tight on her though. Great look, just runs small."
"I bought this for my friend for his birthday. It's a great summer hat as it is a very open weave and lets your head breathe while wearing it. Something that wasn't obvious immediately, the back is lightly knit to have a scrunched look. It isn't a smooth texture all around and is pinched, but it is still stylish and comfortable to wear. It just has a distinct front and back, which isn't that common for a beanie without a logo or image."
"Fancy affordable shoe! You can wear it with social or casual clothes!
Really comfortable and good grid!"
LOVE IT!! GREAT CHARM!!
"Loved the shoes, just not a perfect fit for my big feet. :)"
Great quality and desing
Love love these boots! Would definitely recommend.
"I'm 5""2' I feel that is dress is meant for taller people, but I am still very happy with this purchase. So pretty!"
"NOT for me but for my wife.  40DD requires some good support, and this is my wife's non-fancy, taking-care-of-business-and-the-girls bra.  This is what she wears most of the time. She is very comfortable, she tells me, in this bra."
Love these for my 80's outfit! PERFECT!
"Purchased the blue...it's more like a midnight blue,very dark. Which is what I wanted. Very good luminosity on the hands,brighter than most. Band isn't the easiest to fasten. Excellent value for the price. Fast delivery. Packed well."
"For a look alike Michael Kors basic design, I like how the distressed leather looks better than the leather Michael Kors uses. The handbag is beautiful and roomy and light in weight but not cheap looking or feeling. It feels like I have had it a long time but it still looks new-"
"I was worried when I ordered this shoe that it might not fit because I saw so many reviews either saying it ran small or large or narrow or wide.  It just confused me completely.  Well my verdict: this shoe is true to size.  I'm not comparing with other NB shoes or how they fit, just simply with my true shoe size.  In athletic shoes I often have to go up a half size (definitely true with Nike, Brooks and other brands). I did not need to with these.  I have flat, wide feet so shoes can often feel too narrow in the width but these feel fine. So if you're trying to figure out what size to order, think of your normal shoe size and go with it.

These shoes look great and they are extremely light. The bottom feels very firm and supportive.  I over pronate so I need shoes with a lot of support.  These don't have quite as much as I need just in the arches, but if you aren't a severe overpronator as I am, these should be a perfect for you.  The bottom feels extra sturdy and just wearing them is comfortable because they are so light and yet so supportive. I plan to wear these often, and will let you know of any discomfort I may have in my feet after being in them a while, and also if there are any durability issues.  I have these in the gray and they are very pretty shoes. Definite recommend."
"I love this shirt! It brings out the outdoorsy side of me. The fit and quality of the shirt are wonderful. It comes exactly as it looks in the picture. Most people hopefully want the shirt because of what it says though, like I did. I do wear the shirt mostly as a lounge shirt or something to go out for a walk in. Everyone that has seen it has said something about it. I have no complaints with it at all.

I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
great bra with great support
The outfit fits perfect & the headbands are a perfect fit also.
Love them so soft and smooth
"it's ok, the only complaint I have it that the ring is a little too big and little too flimsy. but it's a cute ring."
"Beautifully made. Easy to open, yet stays closed.  Great quality and condition. Gets lots of compliments."
"excellent quality, great chain. seems durable and has good detail"
"LOVE these shoes - VERY comfortable, I have 'arch issues' and cannot wear flat shows....these are super!"
"What can you say about little dresses for little girls.  Cute, Cute and more Cute.  It washes well and the hat fits perfectly on 9 month old baby girl."
I purchased these for a non profit event on a budget. I needed a huge quantity and for the price this was perfect. They are not soft and are a felt material but they were exactly what was needed.
"I have a few pair of these shorts, I ware them every day during the Sumer"
"I was really excited to rock this bad boy, and based on previous reviews I purchased the largest size they offered XXL(US:L). Unfortunately it was too small. Typically this is the size I wear, I'm 6'3'' 197lbs with a 34"" waist and a 42"" chest. I figured the US Large would have been perfect, I was able to button up the vest but it was noticeably tight. Aaaaaalmost. I have to return it and find something a little bit bigger. For the price this was awesome, but I still had to give it a decent rating as the price was excellent and the style was sharp. If you are going to purchase, go one size larger than normal."
cozy and cheerful
Comfortable to ware.  Keeps me warm. Will consider buy a different colored one.
"This is a very, very comfortable sandal if you like very flat shoes.  It is easy to walk in and, in spite of the lack of any type heel, very comfortable."
those i really love it is the best bra i have ever got before very supportive and comfortable. love them love them love them. i would definitely get more colours from them if they have got.
Bought this bathrobe as a gift for someone. The robe is nice & plushy & a good fit. She has enjoyed wearing it in the cold mornings.
It's a nice shoe but I felt it runs big..quality is great and is super comfy.
"Over the years I've become a real fan of automatics. I don't mind adjusting the day at the end of the month when needed and if I leave it off for long enough that it needs to be reset I regard that as no big deal. It's much better than the hassle of replacing batteries in a quartz, especially if it's a dive watch and needs to be water tested every time (becomes expensive and frankly is a hassle/complication I can live without). Plus the smooth sweep of the second hand on autos is just plain cool. So I do come into this with a bit of a bias that this kind of watch is pretty neat.

This Seiko is a very classic design for a dive watch and the execution is just what you expect from Seiko - very nice. The rubber band is extremely comfortable. I've seen pics of this watch with the oyster band and that looks really cool too but this rubber one is so comfortable I doubt that I'd bother with a stainless band for this watch, even as an alternate. I found that the shape/corrugation of the band is such that I can shower with it on in a pinch and that's fine (will come in handy at the gym where I am always losing track of time if I don't have a watch on). The crown at 4:00 instead of the more usual 3:00 is a thoughtful touch from a functionality/comfort point of view. Definitely contributes to the comfort of the watch while you're doing things.

This is only about my 3rd auto and while I'm happy with the other autos I've picked up over the years (they each have their thing that they are great for) I wish I had gotten this one sooner. It's so comfortable, that I'm having to restrain myself from grabbing the Pepsi version of this nice Seiko for color/variety. I'll get to that later I'm pretty sure."
My search for a good fitting shoe is always difficult. I have had success with Saucony before so I tried again. I was not disappointed! The fit was perfect. The toe box is wide enough but not too high. Great arch support too. Now no excuses for not getting in my morning walk!
I must be losing weight! All too big in the waist.
What band is a little scratchy but overall good.
"First,  this is beautifully made. The details and fabric are well made and better than expected. It's vertical sturdy. However, the sizing is really hard to gauge. I'm a Size 14 and ordered a xxl. That one didn't fit ...unless I loosened the laces and didn't use the modest panel, but I felt like it was to open. So I ordered this black one in xxxl..the first one was beige and black and did not come in a bigger size. This one was just as beautiful and fit better. It's not easy to put on. I needed help. I was hoping to just be able to snatched it all in the front with the clasps but it was impossible. Once I would get two snapped, the others would pop open. So unlacing and relaxing was the only way. Once it was on, it was snug and comfortable. Very flattering."
Replacing your watchband is easy with this tool. Don't waste your time trying to use a small knife or screwdriver.  Highly recommended !
"So cute and very comfortable. I took this on vacation with me to the Caribbean and it was a great choice. The material is soft and airy. The length was perfect. The buttons came down right to my knees.

I am 58, 135lbs. I wear US size 2. I bought a small and the fit was perfect. The length was perfect as well (usually items are too short)."
Nice bag..better than I thought it would be for the price.. Good color..good size...just what I wanted..
These eyeglass holders are exactly what I expected.  I wanted them a little bigger than norm so that I can mount them near my desk to have easy access to my array of glasses.  They were inexpensive and I would buy them again.  They aren't the thickest neoprene but they fit my needs.
This is my favorite item the feel of how soft it is and how long is amazing. You can wear it so many ways. I even wear it warped around my head and tied on the side for that New York look.
My daugther loves the ballerina shoes.
"This is a great everyday watch. It has large, easy to read numbers and a comfortable band. I wear it in the pool, hot tub, ocean, shower, you name it. It never gets condensation inside like my old Timex watch did. I've bought several of these watches over the years and they never disappoint. I've never had a band break or wear out. Usually by the time the battery dies the face is scratched up so I just buy a new one but  I have replaced the battery in one in the past for a few bucks at the local discount store. I also have this watch in the version that has a black face and gold hands. It's prettier, but also harder for me to read in dim light. Love this one for everyday wear."
"Very nice and colorful, Only negative is the inserts are VERY noticeable - when taken out there is NO support to hold up the girls."
HAPPY CUSTOMER
Super cute!  And comfy too.... with great support!
Comfy. Wore it with the zipper in the back. Very sexy
"I bought these as a valentines day gift for my girlfriend
she has worn them and it worked with the red dress"
"I have a hard time finding jeans that fit (and compliment) my middle aged body, and I'm so glad I tried these.  I love that the waist comes up to my natural waistline, and I love the skinny legs on these!  They make my rear end look good (well, as good as 4 kids and 53 years can look), and for once I have pant legs that fit and flatter my thinner hips and legs.  These also fit true to size on me, and have just enough stretch in them to still be comfortable after Thanksgiving dinner. I'm 5-4 and the medium length was perfect.  These aren't ""old lady"" jeans but they're also not something my college-age daughter would like.

There's no muffin top showing, no bulges or gaps at the waist or thighs, and really I don't think I've found jeans that fit me this well since I was in my 20s.  I wish they came in more colors (other than various shades of blue) because I'd buy one of each!

If you're a more curvy woman, try the 529.  I ordered (and returned) a pair of those - if you have a smaller waist and some hips, those are the ones for you."
"I bought this shirt for my husband. He has two other PGA TOUR shirts in different colors and they are his favorites. This one is no exception; now he has three favorite shirts! Consistent size, quality."
Very nice belt!  I purchased an Allen Edmond belt for over $100....for that price I could have gotten three of these babies!  Highly recommend.
Very Nice and good quality fabric size is correct
high quality.  very soft fit perfectly
They are just as described. The chains are very fine and delicate but look good as a set. Good product for the price
"The Product: The watch looks a little different than what is on the original picture but if anything it looks a little better. You can totally feel that the quality isn't too great. The leather strat is obviously stuffed with other fibers and isn't perfect. The band length is a little small for my wrist. People give me comments on it and don't believe it was less that $20.

The Package: n/a

The Service: This product hasn't caused me any issues yet."
"This was a gift, and a nice one. It is well crafted and  high end quality.
And a good looking piece of jewelry"
Skechers are the most comfortable athletic shoe I bought. Tnx
"This sweater is really nice.  It is  comfortable and looks very pretty on.  I got the grey color and may get another.  Also, thanks to Pauline for answering my question.  Since I am between sizes I ordered up and it fits perfectly . I recommend this sweater.
."
"These are my favorite jeans, the fit is perfect and so is the length."
I love it but it's really long
Love the color the quality the price so so cute!
"Wonderful bright HOT PINK color! It's just enough fluff, for a grown woman's tutu. It stands out rather than down! Just the way I wanted it. And it comes in one size fits all. and fits perfectly! I am no skinny Minnie! and it fits me fine!"
These shoes are very good.  They are light weight yet supportive.  Got them for a good price which earns it 5 stars.  Would recommend.
Looks fantastic on my hubby. It's his new  favorite hat.
Cute bracelet.  It was out of stock for a while!  It is a very dark/deep green and not iridescent like the dark blue one in the this same series.
"I now have 4 of these in different colors. They fit great, I just need at least 3 more so I can wear one every day. I'm not sure how my review of this shirt will help you, to each their own, but I will continue to accumulate this shirt in various colors I like it that much. It's breathable, but enough material to let you know your wearing a shirt and not a thin polyester exercise tee."
classics that don't wear out that fast given the price
These were and are one of my favorite onsies! I got some from my aunt at my baby shower and she sowed tutus on them! I had to get more! I love how they aren't to thick but they aren't thin and cheaply made!
Pretty Bow Brooch.....Nice color...Not overly large....
"This is my 4th pair of Crocs----3 of them are the Patricia II style sandals in different colors because they are SO very comfortable. The first pair I ever bought was from the manager at a Crocs store. The strap on one of them fit a little too snug across a couple of my toes-----she told me to throw them in the dryer under a medium heat for 5 to 10 min. then slowly pull on the strap while it's still very warm to stretch it out just enough so it fits across my toes a little looser. She said if I over-do it, just toss it back in the dryer for 5 more min. and it will go back to it's original shape. I did as she said, it worked perfect and that's what I have done with a couple of my other pair too. How incredible is that----I call them my ""heat to fit"" sandals! I just love them and the material they are made out of lasts for a long time----they always look perfect & if any mud or dirt gets on them just quickly wipe them off with a damp paper towel. I highly recommend them!"
"Great, classic button up sweater with pockets!  Beautifully made and also FITS very well."
bonitp
"These are feel really nice.  Love the fur inside and really comfortable.  Haven't had major snow since I received them, but have no doubt they would be great."
"Just got this jacket today & am very pleased with it. Great color, great fit and excellent quality. The fleece is substantially thick & soft. Outstanding value for the price. Ordered similar product from well known company but returned it because of poor sizing and twice the price."
Soft and adorable.  I would recommend this product.
"This is such a cute bracelet.  It looks like it is 3 different bracelets but actually its only one.  I like the different style and designs used to make this.  It stands out from bland normal jewelry.  I feel like this one pops out, the natural use of colors and the kinds of beads make it very earth tone.  I also like owls which is why I really wanted this.  The details on the owl charm are well done.  This is adjustable, which makes it easy to wear comfortably, you can tighten it or losen it as needed. It also comes with a carry pouch you can use to store it when you are not using it or for gift giving.  Everything is secured well so you do not have to worry about losing a bead or the charm.  I would really recommend it.  I feel like this could completes lots of styles of outfits and would go well with many items and colors. ***I recieved this product at a discount price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, the opinions shared here are mine and mine alone***"
Good shoe that can be worn with a causal or somewhat dressy outfit.
Coolest rain boots ever!
I bought these shoes for my daughter in Kindergarten. She loves to play and run. I wanted a good shoe with a good sole. These have been great shoes! She wears them almost everyday. They have held up to everything she has put them through.
Granddaughter loved these and that they light up! Win win for Grammy!
"When I ordered these sneakers I wasn't sure what I as going to get.  Well, ever since I received them I just haven't taken them off.  The holiday season is a very busy season for me since I do decorating.  The shoes have worked out just great.  They are light, super
comfortable, easy to put on and take off, look fashionable.  For me this  has been a super buy!"
Had a chip on the necklace you can see it beautiful necklace wife loves it a little disappointed on the quality with the chip
"Where do I start? Not only are these charming and attractive, but they are absolutely awesome for their function. The size of these is deceptive, because each cube holds much more than it would appear upon initial scope. I love how easy it is to separate essential items from the others, and to be able to designate a specific cube/size to each family member. These cubes allow for easy maneuverability, re-packing on the go, and convenient organizing without hassle. I am extremely pleased with the durability, flexibility, and appearance. I'd recommend to any traveler, novice or otherwise."
I love this top and own 2. It is very comfortable. I grab these on weekends in the fall and winter - perfect!
"These seekers are the best, I wear them daily. I even wore them on my trip to Walt Disney World for a light shoe they are very supportive. When the time comes I will buy again to replace them... Additional Note I am a 6 foot tall woman with size 12 feet, and unlike a lot of other shoe I have purchased they don't make my feet look like boats either! The markings are just enough to break up long lines!"
These work great and seem to last for quite a while.
Really cute. Comfortable. Easy to wear.m
Just right thickness warmth for cold but not frigid weather.
"Feel soft ,good ,made in china"
Good quality and very cute
This runs a little large but overall really liked it!
"daughter loves it. She has already worn it maybe ten times,  no tear or breakage so good workmanship."
"It looks nice, but it's kind of loose, I wouldn't buy it if you're very skinny."
Wonderful beach shirt.
Beautiful pursr
Not too bulky; fits into my boots perfectly and my feet are perfectly temperate. Good product!!
"It takes awhile to put it on; but, it fits well and holds up these DDDs!!!"
"Great product, but it took two weeks for it to finally ship out."
Great.  She loved it.
"It is just because it seems that the last of the boot is smaller than the others I bought, but looks good ...!"
So cozy! Love this brand.
Best thing I've ordered in a long time. I may have to order some more in the near future  Thanks.
Nice fit.  Wide band very comfortable.
"I had gone to Wal Mart when my previous watchband broke and the jewely counter person poked around the watchband rack, rejected a few, then asked if a rubber one would be OK.  Never having had one, I said it was OK.  Bad decision.  The rubber watchband was terrible, thick, stretchy uncomfortable, and came undone on its own.  Within a week I ordered this one from Amazon.  Odd how I tried to order a similar band, but it couldn't be mailed to a P.O. Box.  Anyway, this one arrived a few days later and I was able to throw the Wal Mart rubber watchband away and attach this one.  It is comfortable, fits the watch well and stays put.  There was an extra set of band pins included with the order.  Very happy with the product."
Perfect. And the real deal
"The Timex Men's TS0461 ""Easy Reader"" Stainless watch is great.  It is wonderful fitting with the elastic band. The numbers are highly visible. I would recommend this watch to any man looking for stainless."
"Good value, supportive"
my son stole this shirt from me. gits as expected
Little tight on top...wearer has skinny legs
Worth the investment and keeps you really warm!
excellent quality.... search everywhere in mortar stores and cannot locate would give 10 stars if I could
"Very cute bookbag but not very big, will only hold up to 2 standard size school books and 2 folders"
"This stuff works great. It has kept my feet dry all winter and it is a great value for money. I did several pairs of boots and backpack, a couple of coats each."
1 month after it started to make a hole in the top center front seriously so disappointing they are good for walking going to the beach water proof they dry very easily but not for running don't run on this
"I absolutely love love luv these pants.
To start with i ordered the Sapphire color. The color is very vibrant, just what i wanted to make my boring Mondays joyful :)
These pants have elastic material, gives perfect fit and slimming effect.

Ankle length was just perfect for me, i am short height ed :| - 5' 3""
Just loved it so much that after a week I ordered another one in color Cassie and then after a week one in Dk Charcoal.

Definitely recommend these pants. Perfect for formal office wear.
And for this cost, ah ha :)

Thank you for making these :)"
"These are good quality hose that don't bind on the thighs. I've 150 lbs 30"" inseam and these are comfortable for garters. They'd be a little big with no garters, but that's not why I bought them."
"Simple, cute and worth the money"
Part of our granddaughter's Christmas list and was well received.
"I did order the fit a size larger than normal.  They are very comfortable.  I don't wear them all day but I'm sure someone could.  I need more arch support.  I bought them for when I first get up in the morning until I get dressed.  As a result they meet my expectations.  They are also good for driving if you are wearing heels or boots, these give you a flat foot to be more comfortable for long period of time."
"Comfortable everyday shoez. Just exactly what I've expected. Usually I wear 7.0 but choose 7.5 fits as expected ,a bit big,but still is what I need. 5 deserved stars."
I have had 5 surgeries on my feet and have a really hard time finding shoes that don't hurt my feet or tire them out quickly. I love them and wear them more than any other shoes I own. I plan on buying more in other colors.
Grandson wore them two days after Christmas - felt comfortable and kept feet dry in snow.
They r so soft and comfortable and have a good arch support
"Soft, perfect-fit camo pants, exactly as pictured!  Would order again.  Fast shipping too.  Thank you, Ragstock in MSP!"
VERY NICE BOOT....
Sparkling and lovely color. Mine is more intensely colored than the pic. I think it is perfect. The sizing is true. The prongs are substantial and I feel that the ring is well-made. I have been wearing it every day and match my fingernail color to it.
I am wearing these often.  Very comfortable.
"Very, very soft !  Just what I was looking for"
"Love this t-shirt! Great quality fabric and printing. My son is turning 10 years old, 4'5"", 65 lbs., I ordered the SMALL and it is going to be spacious on him. Hope this helps other parents like me that were having a hard time with sizing. He'll grow into it quickly! :)"
"I like to take these on vacation or if I'm going to play a sport, maybe if I know I'm going to sleep in my earrings these are the go-to pair for me."
Very comfortable. The color is beautiful. Make sure you wear socks--they make it much easier to get the boots off and on. I bought the size I normally wear and they fit perfectly.
"Definitely a good buy at the price, but (and maybe it's just me) the fit seems a bit strange.  A bit tighter around the waist than other jeans/shorts I've purchased with the same waist size, but slightly baggy, um, around the zipper."
It was a little long but was easily altered. She received compliments at every stop.
This skirt is really cute. I like how it's structured and poofs out a little bit. I've seen this exact skirt in stores and on TV but it's much cheaper here and shipping was shorter than expected. It's a black and white striped short skirt that I've also seen in blue and black. I wear mine with a black long sleeve top and black t-strap heels.
The colors & print are very nice.  It washed & dried very well.  My boys like them very much
"run small, and can buy similar ones cheaper at walmart."
An time. Look great
Very cute pajama set. I love it!
"We were looking for a Christmas tie for our son to wear for his upcoming Jazz Concert. This tie is a great quality tie! The material is festive and well made. We knew this was the perfect whimsical tie because it has all of the reindeer on it - each with a funny likeness to their original names (as an example: Cupid is like an angel with a heart arrow). Our son can't wait to wear it to the upcoming Jazz Concert.  I'll post pictures once he is wearing it with his Saxophone. The tie comes in a cleverly designed round plastic cylinder with a lid.  We will be placing it back in the original container, for many more years of use. I received this item at a discount in exchange for an unbiased and honest review."
This stuff is amazing! Not just good for silver jewelry but for silver colored jewelry too! I cleaned all my silver colored costume jewelry in less than a minute and they look new! Awesome stuff!
Ready for business.
"I loveeeeee this classic Barbie swimsuit! It's so retro lol. I ordered a medium, and I'm 5'2 126 lbs. One pieces never seem to fit my torso and tummy right, so I tried the medium and I love it! It's somewhat high cut, but doesn't show too too much, and there's a little cheekage in the back too with a very low cut back :-)....the material is good as well. I recommend purchasing this suit!"
Very cute color and material. Versatile to wear during any season (except snow of course) and it fits well and isn't too tight which is a plus especially since I have fat feet. I didn't give it five stars because I haven't walked all day in it yet so will post about full day comfortability later
Nice quality and a fun addition to my table during this Spring.
Absolutely love these boots. They are good quality and good fitting. Exactly what I expected when I ordered them
The pins were purchased to wear for a choir show. They are perfect and beautiful.  Much nicer than their pictures.
"as long as you keep in mind they run a bit small and order a size up, you will find these boots comfy like I do"
Love this shirt! This shirt is exactly what I wanted.  I will only order my burnout shirts from The Deal Rack from now on.
The only thing is that they are tight at the thigh but they are great I love them
"It's not a heavy coat, but it is quite warm.  Great buy for the money and a very cute coat for a teenager or young adult!!!!"
Bueatiful robe but the front doesn't cross over as others do and does look as the picture.
"Great for traveling. It is small, compact, great compartments."
Order arrived quickly and product seems to exactly as advertised. I have not used them but my wife is very pleased with them.
"very comfortable shorts.
I am 5'5"" tall, 125 lb and i usually wear size 3 or 5. so for these shorts I ordered 5. and it fit nicely. maybe 3 would be ok as well just a bit tighter, but 5 is also not lose.
but the most I love the high rise of these shorts that hide the love handles and make the overall look a bit smoother.
very satisfied with my purchase."
"Yay!!! Thanks to everyone's reviews I was able to order the Large. I am 5'4 and 170 and it fits perfectly. The length is great. These skirts are not meant for you to bend over but to kneel down like a lady so think about that. Fabric is light and almost swimsuit like, I could see it may snag easily, other than that very happy with it!  Oh and shipping was crazy fast.. Like it took 3days?!? But told me 3weeks or so?"
"When I first saw this cap I said wow that is soo ugly & cute at the same time. Just recieved & yup, still feel the same. More cute though !!! Will be using as a pool, beach, bum day attire ...."
"Great teacher bag.  Lots of pockets, in and out.  I like that it has an option to zip the top closed.  I know some people complained about the fabric, but I like it...sturdy, easy to wipe off if something spills on it, and it seems like it will last for a long time."
My 16 year old Loves it!!
"Adorable, soft socks.
Perfect with boots.
Love the pattern/color.
Great customer service."
Beautifully made and so comfortable to wear.  Gives great support for yoga classes and low impact exercise.  Great to wear around the house for lounging.
I love these jean they fit perfectly.
Great compact toiletry travel bag! Fits everything perfectly and good quality.
"Great pants, if you remove promptly from the dryer and hang, zero wrinkles! They do run a size small in the waist."
LOVE MERRELLS - LOVE THE STYLE BUT AFTER WEARING REALIZED THEY ARE TOO SMALL FOR COMFORT
Super comfy although I will have to wear leotards under them in the fall/winter.
Lightweight socks that don't bother my daughter. She has sensitive skin and narrow feet. She loves them!
I'm 6ft. 170 and the medium is perfect.great product
"Love them, they are so cute and comfortable!
Great value for the brand."
"My husband wore these with his tails for a white tie event. They are very good quality, especially for the price."
Didnt think it was real. it was real
My grandson wears a 15W - so grateful to find these so he can run in gymn class!!!
I like these but they are a light weight hold.  If you want a tighter firmer hold I would look elsewhere but these are nice for under skirts for not letting legs rub together.  They are silky so do not bunch up your dress and allow the dress to fall smoothly.  I would buy again for a underwear alternative compared to shapewear that you want to hold all the bulges in.
"I have owned about 4 pairs of these shoes.  They have a sturdy sole that in my experience will not crack or separate from the upper leather. The leather is soft and supple and very comfortable.  The leather color is an attractive brown.  The laces are thick and easy to tie.  These can be your everyday work shoe, a casual shoe, and even a walking shoe - versatility is built into this shoe.
They are expensive, but I find that with proper care they last many years.  I have had some for over 10 years.  I use a brown dye and brown polish as they become scuffed to keep them in optimum shape.

kone"
Fun and unique socks
Great umbrellas. They keep me dry when it is wet out. The button opens and closes the umbrella.
"Finally a sports bra that keeps me secure! I could even run in this thing. Looks great under tanks and tshirts too. I've never been able to find a supportive sports bra at size 30F (reagardless of VS trying to tell me they have my ""sister size"") and this has literally changed my life. I want to buy one for every day of the week!"
My Mom is in a wheel chair all day and I wanted to find a bra that fit right but was comfortable.  this bra is easy to get on and  very comfortable all day
"I should've noticed in the picture that the body was shorter than the sleeves... I also noticed that the body area is wider than I expected. I thought it would be more snug since its a stretchy fabric. Maybe I just have a slimmer waist. The neck is about as low as an Express deep V shirt. The arms will be snug to show off your guns.

I'm 5'8, ~130 lbs and ordered the US S. I think it would look better on me if I was 5'6, ~137 lbs."
PERFECT PAIR OF SHOES FOR EVERYDAY AND HELPS KEEP ME WALKING IN COMFORT. A GOOD NEUTRAL COLOR THAT MATCHES ALL MY EVERYDAY CLOTHES.
Love love bought them for my 19 yr old daughter and she wears nothing else since... Says they are super comfy ... Thank you!
This is a well made belt for $6.  I love the infinite way you can tighten it.. It's a grown up version of a boy scout belt with a improved heavy duty clamp.
I always buy sebago but the color wasn't the way I expected
love this shirt. got it for a starwars party. didn't glow as much as i wanted it to.
Just what I was looking for in an everyday jacket!
These are a little smaller and thinner than I expected but they're cute.
"I love this dress, fits nice and I have gotten a ton of compliments on it! The only con is to get this dress a size or 2 larger than your normal size it is cut small. I normally wear Large or X-Large, I purchased the XX-Large based on other reviews I read and I am glad I did:)"
These are the perfect size for my 3 year old little girl - not too big and not too small!  Great colors and pleased with the overall quality!  Good Value!
"This was a Christmas gift to my boyfriend. It's a nice wallet, and he appears to be liking it. Good price and good quality."
As advertised. Will buy from them again.
"Perfect for what I wanted. Fits well in front pants pocket. Great size. And I added a chain, easy to do. Good product."
"I liked it lol small at first,But I just replaced the small black ribbon with longer black ribbon and it fit perfectly"
"I got these for my mom, she has a wide foot and needs the room at the toe.  She's very difficult to please, but liked these so much she had me buy them in every color."
My top of the line boot brand is FRYE...I love this boot!
"THE SHORTS ARE GREAT EXCEPT I HAVE A 36"" WAIST AND THEY FIT LIKE 38s.  I guess I should feel flattered but NOT."
"Item was nicer than I anticipated, and longer than other reviews were implying:  came down to mid thigh for my daughter (5'7""). The fabric was nicer than I thought and the overall construction very good.  My only complaint was the wings were a little bent and it was not easy to iron them flat.  I had to take the dress in for her, but we expected that since there was no xs option. She wore it for a Halloween social where people dressed either in costume or semi-formal and this straddled the line (she painted her face as a skeleton).  While a bit on the quirky side, this dress is nice enough to wear on a regular basis."
Love the design and the ability to match my familys pjs. Unfortunately these are rather scratchy material in my opinion but soften when washing/drying. The sizing is off - my sleeves were incredibly short (2-3 inches above wrist after drying) and the legs were short as well. The waist fit slightly larger than expected. I usually wear a small in clothing and purchased a small in these. Hopefully if you do not dry pjs they will retain size
"Calvin probably won't like this, but this brief is essentially the worlds most comfortable jock-strap.  I don't care about fashion, but with all the running and biking I do (triathlon training), these make a big difference.

The fabric on is soft, stretchy, and a bit clingy.  It has extremely flat seams.  After a 50mi bike and 10mi run, I felt nothing at all.  No, I wasn't saddle-numb.  It was the underwear.  They were soaked (of course), but even full of sweat they hadn't dug in anywhere.  This was a pretty big surprise.  Normally, water + fabric + movement yields annoyed skin or at least a pressure-point or two.

For comparison, I used to wear&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Calvin-Klein-Men-s-3-Pack-Low-Rise-Brief-Basic-Recolor/dp/B001283MZO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Calvin Klein Men's 3 Pack Low Rise Brief Basic Recolor</a>.  I have a few of that exact type and many of similar style (all cotton).  Outside of running & biking, there isn't much difference between cotton and CK-Ones.  For road-work, though, the difference is phenomenal.

Unfortunately, I don't know how long the CK-Ones will last.  I've only been using them for a little while.  I ordered a bunch more and pray they'll last at least as long their cotton predecessors.

Edit: I read a review about these shrinking in the wash.  Mine have shown zero discernible shrinking.  However, they are small.  My waist is 31~32.  I bought size ""M"" (31-33).  They're almost too small.  If my waist was 32~33, I'd have to use size ""L"" instead.  If you're on the upper edge of a size range, I'd suggest trying both the recommended size and size+1 before ordering a lot of these."
"Just received them. Fit is OK. I would like the sleeves a little longer, but the length is good. You get a heat transfer logo on the Left sleeve. Obviously would prefer the embroidered one but at this price, that it what you get. The length is a bit long, but for casual wear like I will use them it's fine. Material is medium weight and I'll have to see how they hold up after a few washes. Overall I'm happy with them so far."
"These are some of the best silk shawls and scarfs that I've seen!! The colors and the quality are superb! They feel so soft and are great to wear with everything. I love them so much, I bought more. And on top of everything else, they're going towards a good cause. A+++"
"Frankly, it is under-priced for how nice it is; I'm glad I got introductory pricing!!
The satin outer surface feels luxurious!!  The inside is soft cotton that feel wonderful... it's a joy to wear.
I haven't owned it long enough to comment on durability, but it feels well constructed and robust.
If I have any future issues with durability, I'll update this review; otherwise, if this review is unmodified after a year or two, you can assume that I have remained as happy with it as I am now!"
"I bought these thinking they were going to be a nice addition, and they were, initially.  The second day I wore them, one fell out, without my knowledge and the waiter brought it to me.  The clasp was broke.  When I tried to return them, I was told they were ineligible for return.  I would have loved to get a replacement on these because they are so beautiful.  $10 wasted."
Very comfortable. I work 10 hour days.  Stylish too!
Excellent fit as said
My wife loved it for the girls!
I bought these as holiday gift for my late 20s daughter-in-law and she likes them. Not a bad gift from a father-in-law
"Apparently it's very flattering, as I got a lot of compliments on it when I paired it with jeans!  :)  I wish it came in another color."
Very good love it!!
This was a real hit. Fit my husband perfectly and the chest part is really quite impressive! LOL. He looked great and got tons of compliments! Very good price for such a nice costume!
"They truly are very comfortable to wear!
Love them!"
For Halloween.  Looked good on my daughter
Looks of pockets and good quality construction
"Love this bag. For me it looks just like the picture and seems well made. Added bonus , it was half price."
HE SAYS THEY ARE PERFECT WEIGHT AND FIT COMFORTABLY.  ALTHOUGH FEELS VERY INEXPENSIVE JUST RIGHT FOR MY NINETY SIX YEAR OLD FATHER HE LOVES THESE PANTS.
I am 2 things I love shoes and watches. I am pleased to have a band that will almost match anything I chose to wear
"I added my own insert so I am not sure on the arch support, but I recently became a server and these are great for being on my feet all day and for being non skid. They don't fit as well as I would like after adding my own insert but I haven't tried them without. My insert makes the opening a little narrow while I have a ton of extra room in the toes. All and all a great rubber shoe.

UPDATE: I bought a second pair because the slip resistant part of the shoe came off. It seems it was added afterwards and is not part of the shoe itself. But they are so comfortable I had to have another pair!!"
As pictured and expected. Great stride rite quality. Sturdy sneaker attractive with a bit of sparkle.
Love sooo many compliments!
"Nice quality, good size, but took so long during delivery, and there wasn't much choices according to the size, i recommend having many clors and types with different sizes."
love these sandlas
"I have 38 days left in my pregnancy. I wear a size L panty normally, so I ordered a size 8 in these to compensate for the normal size changes over the past 7-8 months. Fit just right. Did not dig into upper thigh or abdomen area. Did not stretch out during the day. Sturdy crotch region, which will come in handy for the postpartum pads, or so I have been told (first pregnancy). Washed up well. ""Sensible"" cotton underwear without looking TOO great-grandmotherly. :-)"
they came kind of quick. I personally didn't like how they felt on my ears but thats me.. Good quality and good for price
Shoes looked great but way to narrow for me.  Never had this issue with any other Cole Haans...returned with no hassle via Amazon.
Fit well!
"Good fit, competitive pricing and fast service."
"These are very comfortable and I like them well, but next time I will get one size narrower. My mid-foot tends to slide around in these. I got the normal size that I wear in New Balance (4E) but these are a little bit wider than those."
"Well, I cannot speak for the fit personally, but my son will not take these shoes off his feet! He totally loves them! Usually getting him to wear new shoes is a trial, but these are the greatest thing since sliced bread (for him at least)."
I have trouble with my feet.  These ASICS shoes feel good.  I have less pain.
"I'm in love! With how the shoes look, how my feet look in them, how my legs look when I'm wearing them. They are my tallest heels and I can still dance in them. Pretty comfortable too."
Wife liked them. We will see if they go full term.
Beautiful!  Exactly what I wanted....speedy shipping
"I like this shoe.  I did have to re-lace the shoes, as the lacing it came with seemed backwards to me and was very difficult to tighten.  The shoes do NOT scuff as easily as I feared, so that is a big plus.  They are doing very well with some hard wear once a week.  I bought them a bit big, and they started off fitting about like I expected (I like to get as much wear as possible from the 'good' shoes).

I'd definitely get these in a larger size when the time comes."
Good quality.  Will last my grandson's summer and more.
Definitely love FlyKnit sneakers they are perfect for exercising and running
"Great Buy!! I'm super impressed with this piece of jewelry!! You can wear to work, and for a night out.  I love it!! My husband picked this piece out for me.  I was totally impressed!"
Needed this badly for my bracelet. Thought I could do without it until one day my bracelet fell off my wrist!
"These are fun shoes to wear.
They are very different from ordinary shoes that match perfectly."
These truly are great for arch support!!
"Nice wallet, kinda cool. If you're looking for a compact wallet, this may not be the one for you. Just slightly smaller than a standard sized men's wallet but still nice!"
Maybe like half a size to big but okay. SUPER COMFY. And they got wet but dried quickly. SUUUUPER comfy.
Looks great on bracelet.
"I bought these as a gift for my dad, and they fit great! They cost the same as most stores, and they are exactly as pictured. I will continue to order these jeans for him in the future!"
Nice looking chains for sea glass
I love this dress! It's perfect for my business casual office attire!
"What a great cross-body purse .... perfect, perfect, perfect in every way !"
Nice and light for my bad shoulder and with all the pockets for organization that i need.
"The product was great, just on the small side!"
These shoes are amazing. They fit well. They look good. I get complimented everywhere I go with them!!
Very nice dress socks.  A little thin but I have owned them for almost a year and they seem as good as new.
"Love my sketchers and these are very unique looking,many compliments and I have only just start to wear them!"
"Fit perfect, arrived on time."
"I love this shirt, it is my second one, I wore the first one out!  It fit perfectly."
"I totally agree with what have been said in other reviews on comfort and fit (I give 5 stars on both).  This pair of Clarks Men's Vortex shoes is the most comfortable pair I have ever worn.  The style also look good for daily office work.

point to note, the sole of the shoe is quite slippery in wet weather.  In the rain, it is still okay walking on concrete pavement, but must be careful if walking on stone/tile pavement and even more so when stepping on those sewage covers.  (1 star deducted for this reason)"
Great value. Cheaper sock but looks great
I absolutely love this scarf wear it when I go out. So comfortable and goes with everything.  Sent my granddaughter a picture of it she says it looks like a midnight sky with stars all over it. I like that there is room also to wear my glasses when wearing it. I very much recommend this scarf very pretty.
Got for my dad for Christmas. He loves it.
"Simply beautiful. I love wearing this beautiful caftan. It's light and breezy, so it's perfect for poolside or just lounging around the house. It's a bit thin but but I could definitely see wearing it to a summer gathering. I've worn mine belted with acute hat and sandals for a day trip to Tybee Island.
This garment is well made and I've washed it several times with no problems. I bought the olive one and I'm definitely going to purchase another. I took off one star because the color was not a vibrant as the photos."
"Super cute head bands very soft, not tight at all, they fit my 13 months old head still very well. Now that she pulls them off I'm hoping to purchase the hair clips from them now."
Great son beats on them
Exceptional quality at an affordable price! Very warm and comfortable.
these are beautiful gloves - the purple is perfect  - the fit is excellent - I highly recommend this glove - you will not be disappointed
"I love this bag.  It's perfect for a 2-3 day business trip (if you pack light).  It is shorter than most bags, so it always fits into the overhead bin wheels first, even in smaller planes.  It is also less likely to get taken by the gate agent to save space on smaller planes.  The wheels seem to be sturdier than most spinners and roll smoothly even over rough ground.  There is also a gel pad under the handle, making it comfortable to pull when heavy or with a second bag on the handle.  I would definitely buy again (though I probably won't have to, since it's Samsonite)."
These shoes are so comfortable. I stand on my feet all day with no problems at all.
"gave these to my wife as a gift she loves them, wears them several times a week. the quality is great and they have a nice sparkle."
It's really nice to have these as extra in my bra drawer.
Really pretty. Not very big. good everyday earrings.
Great watch.  Very classy and a great movement.  Have received many compliments.
IF YOU LOVE TO LAUGH JUST BUY THIS
I can't stop staring at this beautiful thing! I bought this for my mom's birthday and she is going to die. Beautiful color and the shine is fabulous. I will be ordering one for myself as well. Do not hesitate to buy
Looks great! Looks much better than the picture.
"These fit mostly as expected, although there was some weird bunching at the heel, as some other reviewers noted. Doesn't really affect fit so much, it's more of an aesthetic thing. Also, the straps are presewn and a little tight on me, as I have a high instep. I might have sewed a little looser or placed them differently, if I'd had the option. But overall, comfy and good for my needs. Just for context, I'm NOT a dancer, but I take an adult dance class in which we do a little of everything, and I just occasionally need something for more ballet-oriented moves"
"Best booties EVER.  I receive compliments on these lovelies every time I wear them.  Fit great, incredibly comfortable and FUN leopard print.  LOVE!!!!"
This wallet is one of my favorite things.  Even though I don't usually have a lot of money in it.... every time I take it out it makes me smile.  It's that nice.  There is no better wallet for ANY price.  I love the Tobacco Brown color.... just gets better with age.
"Very high quality watch. Accurate time.
Lovely color."
"I bought these for my 11 year old son, for hiking.  He loves them.  He likes the funky colors, he likes how they fit, and they hold up well on the trail.  My husband ended up buying himself a pair (but in blue) :)"
"Great fit. Love the orange color. The brown skirt is really a deep red not brown at all. Stretchy cotton. Light and breezy, great for hot summer days. Modest skirt length. True to size."
"I LIKE IT, VERY COMFORTABLE MATERIAL, A BIT PRICEY BUT I AM HAPPY"
Great present for my niece
Playtex is always a dependable brand. I wish they had more sizes available.
"Ordered these for my wife, she really liked it. Happy wife happy life."
"Fit me like I wanted it too, felt weird at first, but now it's better. My arms are so long so the sleeves are a bit short, but that's expected."
"My 4 year old does not like the elastic in regular underwear so we got him these, he loves them.  My 9 year old wears the same type."
GREAT DRESS SHIRT FOR BIG GUYS
"I love this dress! Great fit, great quality and so pretty!"
"As a bustier girl, I am on a constant search for bras that are supportive, comfortable, and that are not padded or minimizing. A tough feat, let me tell you.

This is a wonderful bra. It is all the things listed above, as well as sexy. I also love that it is convertible to a racerback. It's a unicorn!

So happy to have found this item. I have already ordered a second in the Chestnut color and will certainly be back for more."
I am 10.5 and got the kicks as 10.5 and no issue. Very comfortable and the color is sick. I'm 100% happy with the price and quality.
"I just received this 30 minutes ago, but my first impression is that it's a better deal at a higher quality than I expected. The face is large enough that I can read it w/o my glasses. It looks and feels sturdy. The battery model, as another reviewer mentioned, is stamped on the back of the watch, and a similar feature is that the band's width--24mm--is written on the band. Finally, most cheap watches have soft faces, meaning they scratch up in no time; this one is said to have a harder face. Now, if only the battery will last a few years...

update: months have past. the watch keeps time to about 15 seconds/month. as clumsy and as active as i am, the watches' face could easily be scratched beyond usability, and yet there isn't a scratch visible. i wear the watch 24/7, meaning in the rain and in the shower, and not only is the mechanism well-sealed, but the watch band still looks new."
Literally and figuratively lol great buy
Beautiful.  Fits ring perfectly.  You will not be disappointed.
Love this brand? They only get softer with washing
"I bought this wallet to carry a varity of items including cash and change. It appears well made, and is very roomy. It definitely was what I was looking for."
"Light, comfortable, easy on the feet."
"Very good looking watch. Very lightweight. It doesn't really feel expensive, but it does look fancy."
These shoes are extremely comfortable.  Wore them all day right out the box.
"great jacket, really great price and my daughter loves it. i would buy this jacket again. i do recommend it."
"It needs to be broken in.  My clip broke on the fossil and after reading reviews several people boasted on how this was a great replacement.  Dead on!  I love it.  Love the clip and the outside license spot.  Exactly what I wanted.  Just very tight, need to break it in.  A+ purchase"
Just a little to big for a 2 month old
Didn't know how these were sized. Now I see. Great shorts though.
The fit is perfect and they work equally well with jeans and evening wear. A great alternative to basic black.
Great fit. Wish Puma didn't end it's line of production with so many products so quickly. Looks good with a matching pair of shorts or running pants.
Another great Ryka shoe!  I love them and they were great from the first time I put my feet into them!
Love these shoes. So comfortable and beautiful. I can walk all over campus with no issues.
"Purchased for our daughter's Sesame Street themed birthday party...all family members wore character t shirts. Has held up well, but the graphic cracked after a couple washings. Not a big deal since they aren't worn anywhere but around the house."
worth far more beautiful
"Seems to hold lots but is fat for my pocket!
But Im going to try it! Hope it doesnt make me look fatter!"
"I love this top because of the way it feels, soft like good quality almost like a sweater. Ordered a small and fit perfect just like the picture! I have both colors but wish there were more because I'd buy all!"
Nice pants pretty colors..Comfortable..will order more
I'm 5' 10' and a very light 255lbs after a glass of water. It fits just fine. I normally wear xl so it's what I went with. If it gets too tight then it's time I lose some weight. I usually have on Columbia pfg but I like the design of the huk. Both work fine for me. It sucks that companies like these have to outsource to save a few bucks in production but that capitalism for yah.
Fits more like a medium than a small but you can tie it so it's great! The colors are exactly like the picture. I highly recommend this bikini.
Great bras for the price! They are super padded so buy a cup size larger or you'll fall out ;)
So cute and really fluffy.  Nice quality and goes with a lot of costumes.
Beautiful mask! Love it
"Of course, I'm not the one who'll be wearing this sweatshirt but if a member of the ""other"" gender, I'd be well at ease wearing it in public.  Good Bargain."
Very cute and can be worn a number of ways.
Great look style and comfortable wear of this signet ring.  Definite recommend the seller and ring for collecting bought to represent ring used in Dracula Untold
I normally wear a large.  I ordered an extra large because I don't like my rash guard to fit too tight.  The extra large fits perfectly.
just a little wrinkled in shoulders seam... except that everything is ok
could be a little larger
Great shoe. Awesome toe room and comfort. Absolutely the best shoe I've had. Incredible cushioning.
"love it, shipping a little costly but product is awesome"
"I  purchased both this pair, basically the 2016 model, and the newest version - the 2017 model.  This pair is much  softer and easier to run in.  I'm keeping the 2017 version - but it's definitely not as comfortable as the 2016 shoe."
"As I am a plus size woman, I find it hard to find bras that fit and support too. this is definately one I will order again,"
"Awesome product, awesome price!"
Excellent. Not surprising. Merrell has great products.
I love it! An elegant looking piece!
"I never had enough backs for my earrings. There is a bunch of these in the bag, very useful, will definitely buy again when I lose all these."
"Like all Red Wing ""Heritage"" boots I've seen and owned, the construction and quality are top-notch. Wearing Red Wings makes me not want to bother with any other boots anymore."
"This is one of two products I've ever bought where the reviews were so over the top I was suspicious. But frankly, 2 years now after I started wearing them, I have to agree. The PrAna Zion pants (and shorts; and zip offs) have now become my goto for almost too many occasions. Winter Backpacking? Check. Somehow they keep me warm enough. Summer backpacking? Check. (ok, maybe I'll switch to my zipoffs, but same model). Shoulder season hiking? Check. Climbing in the gym? Sure. Business wear for trips? Check. (Tomorrow I'm giving a speech in front of 250 people in them.) Everyday fave pants? Check. It's just kinda absurd how well these work for so many situations. Belt? No need, the pull tab tightener works well. Side pocket never billows so they don't even come across as having a cargo pocket. Flap on wallet pocket is super handy too. Stains? It's like they're made of teflon, and a small brush and water will usually take out anything that's somehow stuck on. They are NOT nylony feeling, NO loud rustling, just regular feeling pants yet still super water resistant. I will say there's one mod I make, I take em to the tailor to get the lower legs narrowed a bit. But after that I just wear them to death.... only they never seem to die. I've got a few small snag blemishes on one pocket a few years of hard wear in, but since it's black on black you hardly even notice them."
"love shoes, just sent to wrong address."
Best sandal ever made
The colors make the boot laces easy to find. Colors of the boot laces work well together. It is very easy to install.
Love love love great quality. I had been looking for a pair like this everywhere.
"The quality and features of these pants make them top of the line for anyone who carries a wallet, phone, keys, pocket knife, note book, pens, and other regular guy every day carry stuff.

I know 5.11 has a bad rep for the go to garb for the tacti-cool, but I found these pants to be super functional, of great lightweight and durable materials, and of superior construction.  I have found uses for every one of the pockets and find myself reaching for these pants more and more often on the daily.  I highly recommend them to anyone who carries a bunch of stuff around every day."
Fits perfect! Beautiful colors!
Absolutely beautiful and amazed at how beautiful they were I purchased these for my wedding and it went perfect with my dress
Holds everything and the leather has a nice feel to it. The billfold pocket is just a little shallow.
"good quality, long lasting work pants."
Absolutely love this! Order for my niece for a birthday present and she was so happy with it. She couldn't be more excited. I was very pleased with the quality. I am going to order one for my daughters.
My daughter loves these very comfortable.
"These shorts fit me well. I'm 6'3"" tall, 240 lbs and these are very comfortable even after washing them. My Wife says they make my almost 60 year old butt look good too. The only little complaint we had was that the Aqua Haze pair had a little stain on them that we had to get out with a little hand scrubbing. We were successful though!"
I have loved this style Rocket Dog for years.  They fit my somewhat wide-ish foot perfectly and I can be on my feet all day w/o problems.
Love this...only problem is that it either came with a small hole at wrist or was so easily torn I don't know how it happened
"Great looking shirt, it was big enough, and bright enough.  I heard very poor things about the delivery service, but I had ZERO PROBLEMS with them!  They left it right on my doorstep about a week before schedule.  Great job, I'll be ordering more!"
"True fit, well made, feel great, love my shoes. Will purchase again."
My son loves the monkey shirt
"Arrived as promised and described!
Love the lightweight look and feel!"
Well built. Has a solid small pocket for a wallet or small discreet item to be kept. Or watch or jewelry. Mesh all around so items inside will be kept aired. Easy identification. I use mine to keep my rain pants and rain coat together.
Looks great with denim
Bought as present for my daughter and she loves it.  Great fit and very pretty.
for my nely great grandson
they were too big but a very nice looking sandals
Works very well
Use these for favors and small gift bags.
Love this costume. Perfect for my alice I. Wonderland theme at work!!! Fits wonderfully. I ordered a large and it fits exactly as I expected.
I love love love these leggings. Order your correct size because the sizes are spot on. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because a seam is starting to come undone. Not such a big deal if you're handy with a sewing machine or needle and thread. I would definitely recommend hand washing these or on the delicate cycle. The best part of these is how soft they are. Like microfiber soft. I already picking out which ones I'm going to buy next!
511 slim fit all the way. I love the distressed style and the material is soft and stretch. I'm 32 waist and 5.11 and the size 33/30 fits me great. I can't wait to get another color
"I expected this to be harder to put on and a lot more uncomfortable. I was really surprised how comfortable it was for the support it gives. Of course it is more comfortable to wear nothing, but if for what it does it really is a lot more comfortable that any other one I ever tried. It really keeps everything in place and makes you look a lot thinner."
"This holds a lot of clothes and is very sturdy.  The only problem is the wheels almost didn't fit the storage section of the plane.  I had to work with it until it was able to get it in and allow the suitcase to be stored.  It was a panic moment as I had most of my valuables in the carry-on.
As far as the other aspects, this was well made and easily rolled around.  I really liked the suitcase and it was so much easier to use traveling gate to gate at an airport.  I had bought it for trips on airlines but finding I use it on regular car trips.
Like it and gave it a 4 because the problem I had getting it in the carry-on section.
I would buy other SwissGear to others.  I will buy SwissGear when my other suitcases wear out."
This was a prize for the classiest hat at our Kentucky Derby party.  The winner was really pleased to get it and she recently told me she has enjoyed wearing it.
"My son loves his new shoes!  The elastic ""shoe lace"" is snug w/o being tight so he can slip them on but they hold tight enough so they don't fall off.  An added bonus is I don't see the elastic wearing out as fast as the hook and loop of velcro."
These were for my 91 year old mom and she loves them.  Fit is perfect and they washed up well without shrinking.  I would buy them again.
"The ring is beautiful, and Im very happy with the purchase.  The center stone isn't too big, which makes the overall look believable, and easy to wear.  It does sit up much higher than Im used to, which may make gloves tricky in the winter, but Im still pleased with the set.

The only thing I hoped for was larger stones on the band, and shank of the ring.  It comes off as  mirco pave, which is lovely, but the pictures did make the stones look larger than that.

Pretty ring for sure."
I actually do not know how it fits yet as the baby has not been born yet
Pretty top.  Fits as expected.  Nice weight to the fabric.
My daughter was about 2 1/2 months old when she wore this and it was super adorable! It was a little big but worked just fine. Material is thin so if it's cold can put something under it and if it's warm she won't over heat. I have to say though the hippo face doesn't stay up like it shows in pic and I had to do some adjusting so it didn't cover her face which made her mad.
I recommend you purchase one size larger. Beautiful dress
"Wore it over a white tank. Color bleed onto the tank but washed out in the laundry.
Great fit, soft fabric, and a nice color."
"So far so good, fit is good, happy with the tint"
"I've been looking for a great all around go-to jacket, and it's been a couple of weeks of volatile weather in SoCal and this jacket is holding up well in slightly warm to moderately cold weather. It's also been highly windy and this has been my go to jacket. This jacket is light with a felt-like lining that covers torso to neck - arms are lined with different material (I don't know what but it's not felt).

It does run a little small around the arm/shoulder/trapezius area I'm a 44-45 inch fat spattered chest, but that's more my needing to lose some weight like 15-20 lbs, so it's on me and not the jacket.

Love this jacket and have had it for 2-3 weeks, but I foresee long happy uses."
"Very nice socks.  They're easy to put on, well made and just the right thickness for me.  I bought more of them because of their being easier than other socks to put on."
good but bigger than I expected
"I own quite a few watches and have a *huge* collection of straps. This certainly isn't the fanciest, but it *is* among the most comfortable, especially for swollen wrists on hot days: I leave the strap a bit on the loose side, but the rubber holds to the skin nicely, and my watch doesn't move at all. One small caveat: It has fairly small holes, so it won't fit over 'fat' springbars."
I love the cut and colour so much I wish there is an adult version!
Nice earrings. Lovely for spring. I bought them for myself but I'm thinking of buying a few more pairs for friends. It is a fair price and I'm glad I bought them
"I am a teacher and these are my go-to almost daily. I teach Animal Science, so I am often required to get my feet wet/dirty and these put up with just about anything. They are super cute with a small heel, and very water resistant, although not as effective as a rubber boot. I can wear these all day and they don't bother me. I will be buying them in additional colors. I wear a size 10 and these were true to size. I just can't wear super thick socks, otherwise my toes get scrunched a bit in the toe."
very very pretty and the price could not be beat. I have a very small foot and that type of high heeled just is not meant for a small foot. The peep toe hurt my toes and due to the style I had a difficult time keeping them on. But they were perfect for the occasion and I will try and wear them again.
"I knew because I ordered so late that I wasn't going to get these by Christmas Day but they were definitely worth the wait! Beautiful fabric and fine craftsmanship. Very, very pleased!"
"Ooooh I got the camouflage one, fits perfectly & accentuates my booty and legs to the max If you have a flat stomach and some bootayThis is for you!!!!"
I put them on on the first day as soon as they arrived in the a.m. and did not take them off until I returned home late in the p.m.
I ordered a size larger to make it more hip-hugger to get extra length. Really comfy and great with tights. I'd buy it again.
I have had these socks in the past and they are very comfortable.  They fit great and their wearability is great too.  I would recommend them highly as I will purchase them again myself in the future !!!
"These are very cute and fit nicely. They are a little longer than expected and sometimes show below our boy's shorts, but they are very comfortable to him. Regular briefs seem to be too tight on him and he complains, so these are great for him."
I am very impressed with the booties!
"Love them! They feel durable for lots of riding but look nice enough to wear on ""Jean"" Friday at work. I'm getting another pair:)"
"Wish it fit my wrist, was a gift for someone but the date was way passed by the time the item was delivered. Nice looking, good weight."
"These boots are great looking, fit well, and I bought them for a very good price, under $40.  Most excellent."
My second purchase of this exact boot. First was for my husband. My 17 yo loves them so much that I picked up a pair for him as well. First pair wore well and looks reaaly good with jeans. Not too trendy but stylish and well made.
"Looks as it does in the picture. This belt is very lightweight and I don't expect it to last a long time however for under $5, it's a bargain. I ordered a 38 and it is the precise length it should be."
"They are simple square earrings. They are larger than I thought they would be. They can be dressed up and classy, or everyday earrings. Comes in a black box with blue insides."
"Considering how many socks are made more cheaply than ""back in the day"", these are ok. They feel like they will wear out quicker and won't be darnible."
These are amazing great fit
"Elegant but runs a little big, I normally wear large, I followed some reviews medium fits good for me."
"Looks like a grass skirt, very cute and streachy"
Theses are beautiful I can't wait for Spring.
So soft and comfortable!!
"The color, material, fit and length is just what i expected for it to be. It's comfortable, breathable, and makes my boobs look big. Lol!  I love it, and I will be buying the other colors soon. I'm 5'5"" and 110 lbs., bought a small."
"Michael Kors has beautiful products and I am a huge fan! I am constantly getting compliments whenever I wear this watch.  It is a big watch.  The removable links are helpful.  I can take out one of the links and it fits perfect, but I like loose watches so I keep all 3 links in.  Be careful when removing the links, they will fall off.  I have lost a link a couple of times, but luckily I have been able it find it every time."
"Wonderful, comfortable bra"
"This rind looks great, elegant and resistant. I've been using it for about one week every day and looks as good as the first day (I expect that it continues as it is)"
"This Skirt is Beautiful. Came in very nice package and the Feathers are authentic Peacock feathers very beautiful. Has a inner lining that makes it wearable without slip. The flowing design is wearable anywhere. Will love Dressing up in this and Feel as tho I have on a Gown.  It is very well Sewn and would be lovely matched with just a Tee shirt and still Look lovely. The Material is Soft and Silky and Wash should be by Gentle COLD Water only and Hand Wash if possible. and Line dry only.

I received this product at a reduced price for my honest and unbiased opinion."
"I've hated flip-flops for a long time, because they provide no support, look terrible and rub at your feet in a horrible way. After reading that flip-flops are a good option for people with bunions, I decided to give them a try, and I found these. These are super comfortable! The straps are made of a soft cloth that doesn't cut into my skin at all, even between the toes! The bottom of the shoe is a nice, soft foam that molds to your feet without being too squishy. I bought them in brown, and I love them. They go with everything and they are extremely comfortable. I've had mine for almost a year, and they've held up well so far, with a little wear on the bottoms. I expect I'll have to replace these every year or two, but the price is right so I don't mind."
Super comfy! Soft and comfortable.
"Beautiful design, but fits a bit big then an XL from there other shirts."
Beautiful but I wish it longer.
Love the shoes they're so comfortable and better quality than expected. Very happy with purchase
"Great hoodie, nice seller!!!"
"This photo does not do justice to the beauty that actually is. It arrived on time and fit perfect to me..I order it in XXXL.I am 5""3,155 pounds and 36B on bra. I had problems with other corset XXXL because they will be big on my breast..This one is just..perfect. I Think for woman of my size with big breast it won't fit"
"Rainbow makes the most comfortable flip flops in the world. Within a few hours of wearing a new pair, they feel like they were custom made for my feet. I have high arches and these are perfect.  My original pair lasted almost 10 years, and probably would have lasted longer had they not accidentally gotten wet one time. These are a fantastic purchase!"
"Very comfy shoes. I love Sketchers.  I didn't read what the color was, I only looked at the picture and those looked gray, so I was shocked to see that they were black.  No matter, they are still great for walking."
Soft and comfy. Fit well
"Beautiful dark blue color and super, duper soft.  As stated it was very light and warm, soft to the touch.  It definitely looks more expensive than it really is.  The only drawback is that shipping takes a while, but it was worth it."
"These are beautiful, colors are true and vibrant. Perfect Fit.
And they look fabulous on..
Very pleased"
"These pants are very cute.  They are a little too small for me but then, I'm an adult who is small enough to fit in XL girls sizes much of the time, so I tried them.  They do fit, and are fairly comfortable.... but I would suggest ordering the largest size you can, so that they will stretch less when wearing...because when these pants stretch, some of the color is lost a little in the flowers and the background.  When the material stretches, you can see a whiter part of the material in the weave of the fabric a little more... It is not very noticeable... but essentially the colors will dull some the more these pants stretch... so for more vibrant pants... I would suggest ordering up in size.  Then the pants will last longer also for growing children, who for sure will not be happy about growing out of these pants!"
They are light and comfortable.  I felt they did not provide as much arch support as I needed so I have added additional firm insoles for arch support.  Otherwise I am happy with my purchase.  I have had them for almost two months now and wear them daily.  Are they worth the money?  I feel they are made sturdier then some of the other brands like Nike or Adidas.  I will update my post as time goes on on the durability of these guys.
"Nice fitting slipper, warm an cozy for winter. I like these slippers and they can be worn outside if you so desire because of solid sole."
"Beautiful dress! Top part can be itchy but it looks gorgeous and sexy without being out of line.
Got the raspberry color as well.
Cannot wait to wear it!"
"I don't know where to begin.
Let's see...
I see a lot questions and comments regarding the manufacturing of Manitobah Mukluk (MM) products. Just FYI, like any high output manufacturer, MM does outsource. Specifically, in MM's case, to China. And some of the components are sourced from Australia. That said, yes, some of their products are still made exclusively in Canada as well.
You can check MM's website and the styles that are 100% Canadian made have a red maple leaf on their listing to signify as much.
Either way, the Manitobah Mukluk website clearly states ""International Production"" on the products that applies to. Nothing tricky or deceptive.

Now, on to the boots. *sigh* '
The design is just my style. Before I first purchased a pair of these many, many years ago, I was so excited for them to arrive that I was showing the pictures of my anticipated purchase to everyone.
No one seemed to think much of them. And some people even said they thought they were ugly.
That is, until they saw these babies on my feet in person!! LoL
Everything about them is great in my opinion. I love that there are no laces or zippers. I just slide my foot in or out of them with no hassles. The structure of the shaft and the leather are sturdy enough that the boots don't slouch excessively. Manitoba Mukluks are the type of boots that look great on skinny legs; at the same time, are wide enough to fit and look even better on big[ger] calves. '
Beautiful quality leather; very thick yet supple. The color is vibrant. The etched detail/design is lovely but not overbearing.
The lining in the shaft is faux fur. The footbed is plush, non-removable, natural shearling and does get worn down but it's a quick and easy fix to order new shearling liners and slip them on top of the existing footbeds when need be. The Vibram soles are the absolute best. Flexible and they move naturally with the movement of your foot. Not restrictive at all. It's like being barefoot without the nuisance of feeling the objects underfoot that would otherwise be sharp or painful if you actually were. Do be advised, though, that if you require arch support, you'll need to purchase accordingly because these are completely flat. Luckily, I don't have any issue of that nature and these are, by far, the warmest and most comfortable shoes I own. So much so, I have 3 pairs in varying colors. ' ' ' And I always have my eye out for new pairs. I'd wear them everyday if I could.
I've worn them in snow in the dead of winter. I've strolled in them in the rain. They have definitely held up in all types of weather. I've heard people say that these, like any inclement weather shoes, should be waterproofed with a silicon--or a similar--all weather spray. But I've never done that. And my feet have never been cold or wet in these boots. Ever. ' To their credit, these boots have held up for years. Soles, leather and all. To this day, I get compliments and stares every time I wear them--which is often. LoL

What else can I say? Oh! Sizing: I have an annoying pair of feet. Narrow, bony, almost always cold...not to mention the killer bunion on my right foot (which, mind you, never hurts when I'm wearing these boots!!! '). I'm somewhere between a size 8 and an 8.5 in most shoes. So I usually purchase an 8.5 to be on the safe side.
The first pair of Manitobah Mukluks I purchased with the Vibram soles was a size 7 since everyone kept emphasizing that these run large and should be ordered down a full size. Even the MM website says that.
Upon arrival, my big toe was so close at the front of each shoe that it was visible to others that they were pushing at the toe of the boots.
However, I kept them because at the time I ordered, there were no size 8s available and I didn't want to wait for them to come back in stock (who knows when that would have been, if ever). Plus, I didn't want to risk them being way more expensive than what I'd paid for the 7s.
Over time, the leather did stretch and the boots fit like a glove now.
That said, the next 2 pairs of MM I ordered are 8s. And those seem to simply have...""softened up"" over time, as opposed to stretching to accommodate my foot. I, personally, wouldn't order these in a 7 again. So, my suggestion: if you're juuuuust over a size or at a half size; don't go a full shoe size down when buying these.

That's all I can think to say about these at the moment. But I'll definitely update if anything else comes to mind. Oh, no; I know. One more thing.
If you're on the fence about purchasing these or debating paying so much for a pair of boots: GO FOR IT!!! They're so worth it. You won't be disappointed."
"DVS used to be my favorite shoe company, but I've noticed over the past few years the over all quality has gone down. I hope that they improve for there sake. this pair was good, but could have been better."
worn amazingly long for such a cheap shoe. got tons of compliments and everyone wants to know where to get them.
"Thought it was black...but is deep blue (no problem w / it, as I'll use in the pool. Strap was a bit gauged to be either a bit tight to too loose on my wrist. Serves the purpose for the $$."
"I love these shirts,,,,,, and you will too !!"
"Looks like the picture.  Love it!!  Ordered the XL, which is my size and it fits just fine."
"After buying different brands of sized 36-inch waist pants, there seemed to be much variation in brand fitment.  I went with the 38-inch waist Haggar because several brands at 36-inch were too tight.  The Haggar seems to be a quality pant, but 38-inch waist seems to be on the large side for my fit, I probably would have liked a 36-inch waist in the Haggar brand.  That said, it seems other reviewers seem to find the length of the crotch to hip on the short side, and with this I tend to agree, making a 38-inch the better choice for my build.  The length of the 34-inch inseam is very generous, I'll probably need them hemmed.  I bought this pant for bowling as they are light weight to help keep me cool, and to meet dress code rules when bowling USBC tournaments."
"One of the best aspects of this shoe is the light weight.  The width is also generous, allowing more toe grip room.  The mesh upper is cool and breathable."
"Very strong, secure, yet  easy to get cards out and back in. I carry 5 cards and also some cash in the band. Fits in the front jeans pocket with ease."
"Very pretty, good fit, only issue is the tassels keep coming out."
SOOO comfortable...and adorable!!
"Too expensive,  but nice for your horse - loving daughter."
The shoe fits pretty well but the toe box is a little narrow and my toes start to feel squashed after a few hours of wear.
"I really wish you could purchase the bottoms and top separate. The bottoms are a little big, but maybe I'll just grow a booty. Otherwise this is the second high-waisted bikini I've bought and they just fit so well on all sizes. Love!!"
Adorable and stylish!
Very high quality and slim design the Wallet is perfect for the man that has it all
I bought one in red.  It is a perfect fit and has just enough spandex to hold in any extra curves.  I especially like that it is full coverage and the material works well under most of my outfits. I wasn't worried so much about the length but it did come down to about mid-rear length and stayed fine.  I initially bought it to wear as part of a Salt N Pepa costume! I actually came back today to order more!  I wish they had a multi-color pack or multi-purchase discount...I want one in every color and a couple of extra white and black ones!!!! LOL! I
I love these scarfs! I have bought three and they're all amazing!
I believe these definitely  contributed to my not getting blisters despite wearing new hiking boots on two very long hikes. They are great!
Description of this dress is 100% with enough elastic stretch.
Cool outfit I love it!
I have had this backpack a couple of weeks now and I love it. I got the fluorescent Pink with white polka dots. It is so bright and c
Like this cami. Soft and comfy but can lose color very quickly washer if not careful.
Great fit and warm!!
Good quality would order again.
excellrnt shoes
I bought these for my husband and he loves them.  They are very comfortable.
"I love it and I want one in every color. I'm a sz 14, 38 D. I bought the xxl. It's fits well. No complaints."
"I bought this one for my husband.  He usually wears a large (he's just over 6 feet tall and weighs about 190 pounds), I bought a large for him and am glad we did.  My husband has long arms, the sleeves are plenty long enough.  The hoodie fits well, looks good and appears to be well made.  My husband says it is comfortable and he likes the extra pockets.  It is light weight (not lined or insulated) but that is what we were looking for."
"love it.
I get a lot of compliments"
Great shoe and very comfortable to wear.  Would buy again anyday!
High quality boots. They run a little small in size in my opinion.
I just wear these around the house when my feet are cold. We have hard wood and laminate flooring in the winter the floor can feel a little cold
I love it when I can buy a pair of jeans in exactly my size and inseam length.
"This seems like a decent quality dress. I was incredibly pleased that this dress has a light liner in the skirt. As for the fit, I am 5'10"" and typically wear a size large because of my height. I ordered the 12 which is the XL on their size chart. It fits me as expected. I don't like the way the waist lays, but I think a cute belt will style that up and help to show off my waist better. The length on me is not too short either, it falls above my knees but not by too much. The collar and the sleeves are cut high. They didn't cut into my neck or arms, however. I believe the tightness will be due to size. Because this is Asian sized I recommend measuring yourself to ensure a proper fit. Also girls with larger chests might struggle with this top even in the largest size because the fabric does not have much give to it. The color is very pretty and matches what it looks like on my computer screen.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review."
"These are very nice, But the ball on the end is a bit large, aside from that though they're working very well"
my granddaughter loved these beads.
"Got these sneakers for Mom as a Mother's Day gift.  Easy Spirit makes great sneakers. An absolut must have for comfort and style.  I wear Easy Spirit as well, these shoes are very and absolutely comfortable.  I would highly recommend buying for men women or kids."
Pretty good costume wig for the price.
Beautiful poncho..lots of compliments!
"I really like these shoes. These have excellent traction control, are light, and feel stable. They have good cushioning and are well constructed. So far I've hiked about 10 miles in them and I they have been comfortable. I have had a chance to do a little trail running in the time I've had them and these are excellent in that aspect. The shoe runs small so you will probably want to order a size up. I typically wear 10 and a half and this shoe is tight.

Update: I've done a few miles of trail running. These are excellent and quite stable.

I should have ordered a half a size up. I usually wear 10.5 but I need an 11 in this specific shoe."
Really nice product. Feel supper luxurious. Definitely recommend.
love these shoes plan to buy more colors .have not worn them yet
"Great watch. Very casual looking and very light.  I have a different Seiko and it is much heavier, but that watch will go weeks before the power of it goes out without winding.  This watch will only last a few days at most without winding.  Still would recommend it as there is no need to ever buy a battery."
"These fit very well and are the perfect length for me - a shorty.  I love the new jean dark color and they are a little stretchy, providing even more comfort"
"They fit great, look great, and wash up great.  They still look good at the end of the day.  He stands, sits, walks on and off all day at work.  Cool for summer too.  These are his new pants for work.  If he wears khakis for something other that work, he likes these for that as well."
I love these shirts to wear under my scrubs. Very comfortable and long lasting.
"short , just right your belly"
This is a great skating skirt- it's also good for our school uniforms. It does fade pretty quickly- something to keep in mind. Very comfy.
These were just perfect.  Thank you for having these pretty little headbands. I bought some fabric flowers and sewed them on by hand and presented them to the mother-to-be. She was delighted. Thank you again
"I purchased two pair of these boots for my 5 & 6 year old grandsons in order for them to be able to ""help"" me along our creek that runs through our property.  THEY LOVE THEM!  The boots are waterproof and tall enough for them to be able to stomp around in our shallow creek while they explore nature along with water.  I ordered them a size larger than the boys really needed so I'm not certain about their actual fit according to true size but they do fit as I expected them to fit.  The design of these boots are much more masculine than any others I could find.  I wanted boys boots that looked more like Grandpa's work boots and these fit the bill.  Very pleased with them."
Such a pretty ring.  Very petite so mightbe better on smaller fingers.
these are too small.. will order a larger size for next time. they are soft and fit well.. but definitely order a larger size.
Super comfortable and waist fits great. I'm 5'10 and they are pretty short on me but I bought them to wear under snow pants so they'll do
"beautiful ring, but at time did not have correct size for my husband"
I gave these to my godson for Christmas and he looks too cute in it! This hat is well made and feels very comfortable.
"They are ok. Not the most supportive or comfortable slippers i have owned, but as novelty slippers they were nice. They don't last a long time before the padding goes flat."
"I use compression shorts to help with a connective tissue disorder--just found them recently, actually, and have tried several different ones.  These provide great compression giving all the joints a little added support, which helps relieve some of the pain.  Although I just received and put it on, the quality in the stitching is obvious and the materials feel just as good as the UA tactical shirt (no giant ""UA"" logo advertising how cool I am) I bought at the same time for $5 more.  Granted, the UA came with prime same day delivery, so I figure part of that cost was eaten up in the speedy delivery.  Nonetheless, I'd say the two shirts are similar quality and would not hesitate to purchase either again.  If anything, the Champion is a little tighter fitting and holds things together a little more snugly.  Having both in the closet is a good thing for me depending on how I am feeling on any given day.  If you know how UA compression shirts feel and want something just a touch tighter for $5 less, here's your answer.  I will probably buy one more of each, just to keep up with the laundry, but would not hesitate to recommend this as a high-quality alternative.  If, over the months, my opinion changes, I will update.  But for now, great shirt, great compression, great price."
"My husband is usually between a large or an xlarge in gloves, these fit him quite well in a large. He said that they are warm considering the lightweight material that they are, so he is fine wearing them on hikes or working in the garage in cool weather. But if it was below 32 and/or there was a cold wind, they wouldn't be warm enough for him and he'd switch over to his real winter gloves. These definitely are not wind or waterproof (but they don't claim to be, so we knew that going into it). We got them in the black/bryte yellow because for some reason that color was much cheaper than the other colors - we tend to double check price on the size we need in multiple colors to try to get the best deal on items like this on amazon. He's been wearing these quite a bit over the past 2 months and they still look like new. Would recommend if you're looking for a good lightweight gloves for ""cool"" but not ""cold"" weather."
"This is my second pair. They fit great and look great as well. The zipper on my first pair was defective. I am hopping the same thing doesn't happen again. So far, so good. Hopefully it was a one time defect."
Feels a little stiff.  Expected better quality.
"Its so beautiful, and it look like the real thing for a cheaper price. I'm in love with this ring."
"The sizing information is incorrect on this product. They ONLY come in toddler and baby sizes, not big kids. The 6 1/2 W was a toddler size, not youth. The shoes appear to be very good quality and are adorable, it's a shame."
The are so beautiful and make my daughter look beautiful too without bothering her. Great price and great quality.
"This is a beautiful color, & very soft & lightweight."
"My 20 month old wants to wear the shoes all the time, he really likes them. This is the first ""big kid"" shoe I have purchased and they seem well built and more sturdy than the previous walker shoes. They are easy to get on and off. I am sure we will get a lot of good use out of them."
Got this cap and some dog taps for my three year old grandson for Christmas. He loves them. It would be great if it had a Velcro strip in back to attach a name tape strip.
Great material. Love the pockets. Absolutely no stretch in the waist of the black and white floral print. I am about a size 14 and the waist was tight but I made it work :)
"This was a steal, 2 pairs of cute flip flops for 25$! This brand sells in beach shops down here in FL for $30 to$40 a pair. I couldn't pass this up. They are very comfortable too!"
"Arrived on time. Quality ok, some fraying on laces and appeared to be a bit used. Also bottoms are totally flat so a bit slippery on tile floors"
You just can't go wrong with TEVA. I had to buy these after the pair I had for 8 years started to show the wear and tear. They are still good for pool shoes! I expect I'll continue to love these new shoes for years to come.
I ordered a size up because it was my first time ordering from this company. I am smaller in the breast area so I just pull the center string tighter and it works. I love the flow of the top.
"I'm a recreational runner who logs 700+ miles a year for cross-training and the occasional 10k or half marathon.  I have really enjoyed my Mizuno Wave Precision 13s for roads, and New Balance MT-10s for trail running, and was looking for a new set of road trainers/racers with a low drop.  These fit the bill perfectly.  The Wave Sayoraras weigh 8.1oz with a 10mm drop -- a fairly minimal shoe.  Their one-piece uppers fit me like a glove.  I'd recommend these for mid-sole runners who don't pronate, are looking for a light weight shoe, and are used to shoes with a smaller drop and minimal cushioning."
Got this shoe.  Awesome color.  Could wear all day if I had to.  Eventually bought another pair.
"Soft and comfortable, great color! Excellent quality!"
"Durable and fun and lively for our kindergarten boy. He loves it. His classmates admire it.  Many pockets!  Fits lunch box and folder; mittens and hat; snacks, holds a water bottle and even has a pocket that fit his Crocs now that is winter here in Michigan.  I see this backpack lasting a few years!"
My son loved this shirt! Wears it all the time
My son wanted this jacket and he likes it. Fits well and holding up well.
"fits somewhat small but nice overall.  not for all body types, and not the best quality material but good for a few wears. you get what you pay for after all. If I could go back in time I'd get one size larger. my husband loved it but I could hardly breath and I was afraid I'd split my pants the whole time."
"My son ordered these in his usual 9.5 but one of the boots was just too tight. It was out of stock in a 10 so we didn't get to try it larger. They are absolutely gorgeous, though. Wish they would have fit."
"very hard shoes - seem very protective - and i love the non-marking soles, she has to have this for school."
"I'm in love! Fast delivery and the purse is better than expected. Thick canvas material, excellent craftsmanship, and true to color represented. Amazing price and quality...I'm in love"
"This is a great bra! It's comfortable, smooth under clothes and doesn't cause 'bulges'. I've bought several in different colors. They wash well and they're pretty."
"I don't like the 3-packs where you don't have a choice of the color and can even get polka dots or stripes, etc."
Tight fit but very flattering
"Love it , although somewhat heavier than expected"
will buy  again
Fit just as expected.  Great for Halloween costume.
"The top fits, the bottoms are way too big. I wish you could select the sizes for top and bottom instead of one set size. Unfortunately, I don't know anybody that wears the size bottoms, so now they will end up becoming oil rags for my husband."
My child won't take it off.... Love it!!!!
Attractive. Nice Color
Holds a lot.
Made the painstaking pumping a happy and hands free experience
Very comfortable. Roomy and cudhy toe box for hammer toes. Break in a little a day or legs hurt!!
"Bought this because I wanted a purse I can fit a lot of things in like a tablet, phone, hand sanitizer, and just about anything else I could need without looking oversized. This bag does is it. All around happy with this purse."
Only negative is that it took a long time to ship. That being said the T is very cute and fits exactly like it does in the picture. Perfect top for my mermaid look. It is also soft and has no awful shipping smell.
Love this boots. This is my third bailey boots. Very comfy and keep my feet warm on winter days.
Great quality for the price.  I would definitely recommend!
Love this out fit! it so stylish and easy going! Only thing to be aware of is that you have to undo the buttons to use the bathroom so if your child can't do buttons its going to be an all day thing! Other then that super cute!!
I got this for my scrubs and the fit is perfect.  I love the color and the quality is excellent.
"This is the kind of scarf I used to pick up from vendors on the streets of Manhattan. It's been a couple of yrs since I have been there. I think I used to get them for around $5 each. So this was almost double the price.
It will last for awhile if I don't snag it. I use these in the summer a lot, when I think I may be somewhere with too much air conditioning.
In a pinch I have successfully used it as a headscarf, too.
It washes fine in cold/gentle. Garment bags help prevent snags during washing. May need ironing after wash."
"These boots are so cute, my 5 yr old wanted boots like her 16 yr old sister's Minnetonka fringe boots and Amazon had the best price. I think they run a little big, my daughter is in a size 8.5 and the size 9 in these boots were pretty generous. She'll get lots of wear out of them, the leather is nice and sturdy."
"This dress is so cute! I got the M, going by the size guide. It's a tiny bit too small, but the fabric is stretchy so it's ok. I would recommend going up one size just to be sure the dress will fit you. It is a little longer than in the picture. It comes to about 2 inches above my knees, which is fine with me.  Overall I'm really happy with this dress. It's totally worth the money! If you want a cute, fun dress to wear when you're feeling witchy, you won't be disappointed! I will definitely be ordering more."
Got the brown color. Very comfortable. Beer cozy bottom is very nice. Would def buy again or buy another color.
"My friends all wear Sperry shoes and have pressured me into purchasing my first pair ever. I am so glad I gave into that peer pressure as these are the best boat shoe I have ever owned. They are a nice look and feel. You do have to break them in, but for me it only took about 3 wears and they wear perfectly. I wear these to work and expected my feet to hurt in them midway through the day and was very wrong in thinking that. I can wear theses shoes all day and not have my feet hurt at all! I look forward to my next purchase of Sperry's very soon!"
I love this product! It's so nice to be able to pump hands free. The only thing that could make it a little better is easier access to the nipple.
"Easy to pull up and maintain shape the entire day (I'm 5' 4"" and 128 lbs). The black cat part feels thicker and higher quality than the nude tights part, which seem a little thin and needs more care while stretching. When I first got the tights, the merge between the black cat ears and the nude colored thigh section was already strange as there seemed to be some black not belonging to the cat ears on the nude section. After wearing this for a day outfit 5-6 times, the line between the black cat ears and the nude tights has begun to fray, and the soles and ankles of the feet have begun pilling. A really cute and comfortable buy, but not meant to last long-term."
Soft and such a beautiful color. I'm going to be bummed when my little girl outgrows these.
"I purchased the silver buckle with wings leather Slidebelt and I like it very much.  The buckle and belt are separate and once I determined what size to make it I made the cut in the back and inserted the leather in the appropriate latch and then tried it on for any further adjustments if any - they were not needed.  I like the fact that there are no belt holes and the buckle has a type of ratchet mechanism which makes incremental changes in the size very easy.  Further the ability to have it fit by this adjustment rather than where the pre-placed holes are is very nice.  While these two variables may seem minor they are essentially the two major reasons I purchased the belt.  As my weight fluctuates and pants size fluctuate so will I be able to have a belt that adjusts as well.  The fact that one can easily change buckles and/or leathers are just additional pluses.

There is a small downside in that I used a scissor to cut the leather belt down to size and it didn't cut exactly even the first time and it still has a very minimum angle.  I'm sure that done with an appropriate leather cutting device it would be even.  It isn't enough of an issue to deduct a star.  And finally a question is posed to the reviewer asking ""how the product fits?""  It is kind of rhetorical in that the very nature of the product is a belt that fits."
I love these sandals and you will too!
Theyre somewhat large but reminds me of a pair of boyfriend sweatpants so I love them either way. But I was expecting them to be more form fitting as depicted in the photos.
"I may order several as gifts. This is nicely made of heavy cotton. The sizing is more accurate than expected. An XXL shirt should fit someone who needs an XLT for length, but it might be just a little loose around. The sewing details are well done too.
It does, however, have that odd sizing odor that requires a couple of washings to remove, but it's not that bad."
"Pretty perfect. Was  concerned that it would be too tight around my big hips, but it wasn't.  It's really stretchy on the top part, and I think that the sizing chart is accurate as far as the waist and hips sizes these will fit. I got white and black, the basics.  I wear a size 18/20, for reference. I ordered size 2x and they are perfect.  I also have found them to be very wearable at work without being costumey because it's only a 2-layer crinoline, unlike many of the 5-layer fluffier ones you can buy. It gives all my rockabilly circle skirts and dresses just the right shape while still being functional to work in."
"These boots are awesome. They fit perfect to my size and are wide so that my feet do not feel closed in.
Also they are easy to put on over tights, jeans or any close fitting pants. They definitely keep my legs warm
and are very comfortable to walk in for long periods of time. I definitely recommend these boots."
"Tiny sterling silver hoops. Put them in, haven't thought about them since. Difficult to maneuver at first, because they're so tiny. Sturdy feel, haven't caught on anything.  Recommend"
Very pretty looks just like picture already have had many compliments...only thing was top jewel was uneven but was worth price and would buy other colors
Beautiful watch!!! Love it!! Fossil makes some handsome mens & womens watches! Great quality!!
Fits perfect! :) Very cute. The bow on the bottom part came off but can be placed again.
"These fit perfectly. I am a 71/2 more often than not and these are perfect.  I always wear a medium thick sock with all my boots, so with that being said if I wore thin hosiery I would order a 1/2 size down.  The comfort and support are great.  I stand all day with no problems."
Great for toiliteries
Keep me warm when I'm skiing and they handle the moisture better than the old-school cotton ones.  I'll probably end up buying a second pair to replace my old cotton thermal underwear
The quality was good and worth the price it just ran pretty big!
"loved it even though it was a little smaller than i expected (& i bought bigger than usual because of other reviews).  but i guess as bat woman, you should be sexy!  it also had a small hole in the shoulder area.  I wasn't too concerned since it was literally a one day wear costume."
"Lovely denim overalls. Son wore it often, until it grew out of size. Comfortable, not hard. To him go any T-shirts and sweaters. I'm happy. Now it is the boy next door. Gave as good as new"
Sexy long sleeve shirt that shows off the cleavage!
Love these shoes for my kids!
"Perfect! Super soft, the best!"
"I'm shocked at how beautiful and nicely made this dress is for under $40. Sure there are 1-2 things that you can see weren't done like a $100 dress, (like an unfinished hem at the bottom) - but at under $40 I don't care in the least!  Nobody is going to be staring at your he in this dress.  Wow.  I bought a 1x:  I am 5'5"", no hips, have a belly, size 16ish, and a 44"" chest.  This dress went on easily - but without something to slim out my lines, it just wasn't a match made in heaven.  If you have a smoother figure - or aren't as vane as me, this dress would be lovely.  I'd recommend it, even!  It's really pretty and could be used for a lot of occasions.  For the price, quality, and what you're getting - 5 stars."
"Fits good, is really soft and seems to be a quality product."
Can't wait for summer to actually wear these out of the house.  I've made a couple of skirts and tops to wear with these.
This is a beautiful dress.  It is very interesting and high quality.
Good quality and classy from afar and fun up close. You can where it to any event for work or pleasure.
"Love this infinity scarf. Have used it regularly since receiving. I get compliments on it frequently, and the scarf it self is thick and so soft!"
Super cute and the skirt was surprisingly soft.
"very nice, well made and looks great on the watch"
"Love, love these shoes! Fit is awesome!!!!"
would've been 5 but had no shoulder strap.
I'm a diabetic and need to take 5 insulin shots a day in my abdominal fat. This T-shirt eliminates the need to tuck in the shirt and pull it out 5 X a day.
My daughter had a larger suitcase that was just too big for her to easily get in and out of her car trunk and way too heavy.  This one is perfect and has four wheels which makes getting around the airport easier. We bought the black one.
"This blazer its beautiful, I buy in size 40/L, this is the size of I used, but i have a small problem with the size in the sleeves, because... Apparently the back that connects to the arm is a little small for when I move my arms. But, despite this I will use. Its quality is very good, is a blazer lined and elegant for any commitment."
Really cute and great price. We loved using these instead of shoes
"These are perfect for my two year old. She loves the designs but more important the fit is perfect...not too tight around the legs or waist, and not loose either.  Priced right too!  Will definitely buy some more of these!"
"I really do love the quality of these Stride Rite shoes (and their products in general), but this style seems to run a little small. My toddler doesn't have particularly fat feet and these are tight on her. Also - I had to return the original shoes that were sent because they sent a box labeled with the correct size (4), but the shoes inside were a size 3. Amazon made it right quickly, so the 4 stars is just because they run small.."
I was really happy with the color! Love these glasses!
"I love this sweater! I'm 5'10"", 145 pounds and got a size 0-4 (S). I was worried about the sleeves being too short but they're perfect! Love the way it fits and the material is high quality. Will definitely be purchasing more colors in the future!"
Love this skirt... fits great and looks nice all day long.
"Haggar Men's Cool 18 Hidden Expandable Waist Plain Front Pant is a quality product, with a nice fit, and a reasonable price."
Nice little purse-- wry handy--well constructed.
"If you're looking at this shirt you know the joke. Great for Taylor swift fans. Good quality, my daughter loves it."
Came early. Love the material and fits perfect. I think I got a medium and fits good. Alittle shirt but that's a-okay!
Fit perfectly and comfortable. Great quality.
"If you are hesitating about ordering this dress, STOP! Order it! It really is perfect - and how can you beat the price?! The quality is definitely not compromised because of the pricetag, either. I purchased this dress for my husband's Military ball. I needed something that would work on my 8-months-pregnant body. After buying a $300 department store dress and having the fit totally off, I decided to give this dress a try. You can imagine my pure shock when it fit like a glove, looked wonderful and was even the PERFECT length (I am 5'5"") Overall this dress surpassed my expectations"
Stunning!!!!! These are just so darn cute! I love the graphics on them! So clean an crisp! I tell ya your going to enjoy them so much !!
These are nice shoes. I will enjoy wearing them.
Nothing not to love with is bag. I get many compliments and enjoy the different color scheme. Great structure as well.
"My wife is 5' 4"", & weighs about 157. She normally takes a size 14, but we ordered a 13. These jeans fit her perfectly. And you can't see, but they do have a zipper. So a perfect pull on set of jeans with the usual pockets. Couldn't be happier. They do have a slightly odd odor but our guess is it's something they used to get the stone washed color. She ran them once through the wash with Downy, & you can barely smell it. Will go away by next wash."
"I recently lost some weight and dropped down from a 38 to a 36 waist so I wanted to purchase a pair of pants in my new size.  I am familar with Carharts but have never owned any of their products.  I considered Carharts more of a warm work pants or jacket.  When I saw that these were on sale I thought I would give them a try.  They are very durable, double stitching, the belt loops are wide and the pants are somewhat thick but not winter thick. I work in a professional setting and am allowed to wear casual clothing, something along the lines of casual friday.  I have worn these pants to work and they are a little plain.  They fit me very well.  I could get away without wearing a belt but they are not too tight.  I think I could work in the yard in these pants just fine.  Since they were on sale the price was not bad but still a little high.  I really believe you are paying extra for the name.  I am used to getting a pair of dockers for about $25.  I have not owned them for very long so I can only assume that they will hold up as well as a pair of jeans but look a little bit dressier. It is hard for me to say at this point that I would buy another pair at this price (I bought two pairs at $35 per pair)."
I had to re-order a size up and even that is still pretty small. I recommend going 1-2 sizes larger! It's cute though!
Fit is great.  Fabric is soft.
"I am a woman who needs to wear junior sizes and I wanted a short that was slightly shorter than the longer ones I have been wearing, so I thought I'd give these a try. I am usually a size XS or 0-2. I ordered the size 1 and they fit well - just a little snug around the leg but I'm sure they will loosen as the day goes. I have yet to wear them all day yet. They are very cute but I ditched the belt. I thought the price was a little steep. I buy a lot of American Eagle shorts and these were more expensive, which should not be the case. All-in-all, I am happy with these shorts and look forward to wearing them on vacation next week!"
Bought it as a gift for my mother for Christmas and she loves it!! Great fit and the material is nice too..I would recommend this to any woman..
I love this one it is very comfortable.
"They're nice, but are available for less money elsewhere."
"Fits as expected, super cute on!!! :)"
Love them. I really like the round cut ones. Wear them all the time.
Beautiful pair of earring they are a large size if you look big earring. They are a solid pair of earring. I love the style. Also items arrived promptly and great price.
My daughters Favorite boots
"Puma shoes have always been my favorite shoes.
These are very nice looking shoes.
They run a little small.
But, seeing you cant get NON neon shoes anymore, these are great.
I had another pair of these for 3 years,and then they got a hole in them, ive had these a year and still going strong!"
This is so beautiful and I love it..
I cannot begin to explain how AMAZING this product is; it's FAMTASTIC! My husband loves it; it will be great for stage performances. You can't go wrong with this purchase!
gift for daughter and daughter in law loved this its beautiful
Really enjoy this bracelet. Makes my watch with a Jubilee strap look much classier now.
States Crowley but we all know its Bobby I love it
Very Comfortable and great quality for the price. I love this brand - Ryka.
"Like everyone said, its a little longer than expected, but its okay.
Update: Candyfancy contacted me to send me another that fits better. Great customer service."
Pretty good shoes. I have different foot problems and was able to wear these for most of the day without any pain. The dark chocolate color is nice -- can be worn with with most suits that I own.
"Really unique design and excellent quality. The different color crystals has a very expensive feel and really shines under bright lights. I put this one on my bracelet with more muted color charms and this immediately becomes the stand out piece, and makes it a really cool look that goes with more formal outfits. What's funny was that I didn't realize it was a hot air balloon at first. I just thought it was a really well designed charm so i bought it."
Very nicely made.  My only small issues is it could be an inch longer to fit my long gowns.
Love these boots! Fit great. Solid tread. Comfy.
Can't go wrong with wranglers ! Never wear them out
I love them they keep my feet warm!
Super cute and fun for a pull over!
"Love them! I'm 5""4 and they are not to talk, adjustable back allows me to wear jeans or leggings. They are hard to get on and off but the 7 fits perfect with socks( I'm a true 7 1/2 with wide feet) they are also very warm. I'm glad I went with these as I have a 15 1/2 calf. They are not tight at all even on smallest pull. If you are 5""4 defiantly go with these verse the huntress."
"These are a really good idea, I got them for my pre-teen and teen since they always seem to destroy shoestrings 5 minutes after wearing their shoes... I gave these 4 starts because they do exactly what they are supposed to, but, my son still managed to destroy them in less than a week. I was so much hoping these would be more durable since they don't untie so they're not dragging the ground like his other laces. I would still recommend these though! especially for someone who doesn't annihilate shoe laces by just looking at them as my children do..."
It is difficult to find nylon briefs so I am pleased with this product.  I though I was ordering all white but the assorted colors are fine.  The order arrived on time and in good condition.
I love the colors.  Fits great.  Super comfortable.
"Bought these for my husband. He's very pleased with them. He went to work one day and came home with his old boots flapping in the back, they essentially just peeled off! So it was time for a new pair. These look even better on him and he says they're even more comfortable than his previous pair. They fit perfectly; the side zipper is really handy. He works as a Security guard and really likes Bates. (The old pair was a cheap pair, we decided to go with quality this time.) I like buying online because you can see previous reviews, I'm glad we went with these.

Update: It's been almost a year and my husbands boots still look nice. Very durable. We actually ordered a second pair a few months ago, one for work and one for every day wear. Well worth spending a bit of extra money, instead of constantly spending money on cheap pairs of boots."
"The chain is perfect, it is rose gold to match a pendant. it is a box chain and is very comfortable to wear. The clasp is durable. I would definitely buy again from this seller."
Great quality especially for the price! Its perfect for my 3 yr old.
"Cool top, soft feel, I am 5'5"" and 155 lbs. The top is fitted on me in a large but NOT tight. It's perfect for me. Another one of those tops that can be worn all season!"
These are wonderful and fit very well.
Even prettier than in the picture. Perfect fit.
"Mommy Shower :)
At the baby shower, surprise the mom-to-be with a bit of pampering when ""it's time."" We chose the Vera Bradley's line of products to create each Go Bag theme. Bradley products add beauty as well as practicality that allow moms to look stylish and feminine while tackling the challenges of parenting for years to come. And..the bags are machine washable! Yay! Note: take the cardboard out of the bottom before washing.

We include the Vera Bradley tote with the Go Bag Basic package, which includes a Tervis tumbler, lid, handle and straw, a massage ball, lip balm, healthy snacks."
"I ordered a 8.5, and am 95% of the time buying 8.5 US, 5% is 8 US. The shoe was a little long and wide. The length doesn't make too much of an issue though. I have been seeing comments about color issues; however, it came as ordered and will report back if the color fades/changes."
"Very durable bag! It is really pretty too, I get tons of compliments on it. I love the water proof compartment on the one side, great for swimming/sweaty clothes, and it has lots of small pockets inside too for jewelry/phone etc. A great size, I can fit a towel, workout clothes, makeup bag, and even my shoes if I want in it. But still small enough to walk a few blocks to the gym, from work."
"This is the second pack of these I ordered for my 3 year old son! I love them, he LOVES them so its a win win for us. The band does not cut into his skin or roll down with wear. The only thing as I wish were #1 if they would make other colors because we would buy every single color pack and #2 the very minor downside is they tend to ride up his leg a bit so if they were a bit longer I'm not sure that would be an issue. So soft, well made and money well spent!"
"Overall, the quality of this top was very high. I ordered a large and it fit loose enough to wear a couple base layers underneath if need be. I am 5 10,  150 lb. If I was looking for a snug tight fit, a medium would be appropriate. But if you intend to put a couple layers underneath, then you may want to size up.
It may seems thinner then you might expect, but it is extremely warm, and flexible enough to have good movement with little or no restraint. I believe you could easily wear this as an outer layer alone, as it is also very fashionable."
This is a very glamorous glittery belt and the width is just perfect and fits through my Lee jean's loops. I bought it in black and will now buy it in tan or blue. I wear a size 12 in jeans and ordered the large size in this belt.
Love it!! It looks fabulous under the dress i bought it for and I will be ordering it again in a lot more colours for my other Lolita and Rockabilly dresses!!!!!8
Fair quality and it fit as it should I'm a 46 regular
"I have been looking a long time for just the right pair of workout tights. In particular, leggings with a high waist (for a long torso), petite length (5'4""), and snug fit to attractively hold everything in. So these are capri length, but on a petite frame, they are just about full length. I wore them for the first time for a Bodhi Barre class and they were were comfortable and breathable. I purchased the medium when I normally wear large, per the reviews recommending buying one size smaller. They fit superbly. I am happy I ordered two pairs at the same time ... I love them. I love the 90 Degree By Reflex brand. They make some good-quality, stylish children's clothing, too."
looks awesome on and great quality. shipped fast
"The quality is fantastic!  the socks are soft, stay up, and the design doesn't make them too tight the way some designs can.  Love the bright colors, I want EVERY pair!"
My daughter loves this present I got her for Christmas 2013. Still wears them most days to school.
"I love it because the price and the quality of the Hanes Men's Classics 6 Pack V-Neck Tee, White, Large"
"Nice shirt, I'll only wear it once a year."
I can't say I love these sneakers but they do the job.  They fit a bit more snug then other Nike I have purchased and they are cute.
"This hat is great.  We purchased it to protect my little guys had from the sun and find it to be very good.  It is not cheaply made and the seams are all well sewn. My son had not tried to take it off, which is a great sign because he usually hates hats."
Great costume! Fit great. Loved it
my boy loved it
"It fitted nicely but the back opening is too big for my ""behind""."
"The band is exactly as advertised, and priced exceptionally well.  I am very pleased with it, and it is the only one I found in this size.  I don't care for larger bands."
"I love these, ordered them in red for an event. So decided to get them in black, blue and gray that's how much I love them. Keep your hands warm while free to do anything with your fingers. I also got a pair for my sister who loved them so much. Thank you"
"Really cute, warm, versatile boots. They even stood up to a wash and dry cycle after being left outside in the rain."
This is the 4th or 5th pair I have ordered for my husband.  That is all he wears and they hold up great.
"I recieved this on time and it was in good condition.
It is well made with no visible issues and it is a light breathable material.
I am 5 ft 4 in about 118 lbs, I am usually a US 4/6 and I ordered this in the 4/6 for comparison.
While I love this romper it is a bit too small, I have a long torso and broad shoulders and it is pulling quite a bit at the shoulders. My sister is 5 ft 120 lbs and also a 4/6 it fits her much better, and looks more like the picture. If you are over 5 ft tall id go with an 8/10 for a more comfortable fit. I am definitely ordering the larger size.
**I recieved this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest opinion of it.**"
"I am very happy with these boots; warm, comfortable and stylish."
I bought this for my wife -- who is wearing 16 womens -- was a hit and has become a favorite.
Is very underwear to wear in special moments. Is very nice but not easu to clean. Is a delicate panty to wash.
"I love love love this bag!  Excelent quality, excelent style, perfect size,(hold more than it looks like it can hold). So true to its name, its a ""perfect 10"".
 My only disapointment is that the picture shows a cute clip on tag and mine did not come with that, would have liked to have it!  GREAT BAG, plan to purchase another by this company."
"I'm so glad I discovered SetSense bowties on Amazon.  Never thought I would find nice looking and great quality self-tie bow ties for my husband here.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SetSense-Men-s-Polka-Dot-Jacquard-Woven-Self-Bow-Tie-Set-One-Size-Black-Yellow/dp/B00WMF2EN2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SetSense Men's Polka Dot Jacquard Woven Self Bow Tie Set One Size Black / Yellow</a>Yellow dots are more gold than yellow."
Fits true to size. Very comfy for the gym or hanging out. I usually wear a small but I got a medium so that it would be more relaxed. If you want it snug then get your normal size.
Very cute & comfortable!
Love love this hat.  Would have given 5 stars but it smelled sooooo musty.  Had to toss in wash right away.  Washed well. I air dried it and it came out beautifully.  Super warm and is very well made.
Very cute & fits well
"The print is beautiful, a bit smaller and shorter than I would have liked but overall happy with my purchase."
I ordered this for my son-inlaw to wear at work during the winter.  He loves them and worn them on days that it was cold enough.
Awesome Boots!!!! Great in weather and soothing comfort!!
Love these - comfortable and great looking.
"Could be better designed in the front, but it does what it says."
"I love the boots, but they would not fit over a broken ankle repaired with plate and screws.  Unfortunately."
Glad I got them.
Nice hat with that 20's flapper vibe.  Looks good with short hair.  Keeps your head warm too :)
"Who doesn't love The Big Bang Theory, right? This shirt represents one of my favorite episodes from the show. My only complaint is that is is just a little on the small side. However, I am also a busty girl and this is a Juniors size."
"I bought these as a gift for my Maid-of-Honor to wear at my wedding.  They're a little bit bigger than I expected them to be, but they are gorgeous with a vibrant blue stone and just the right amount of Bling."
I run a few OCR's a year and I found this Inov-8 being really good right from the get-go. They fit just perfect and no need to break them in. I highly recommend this shoes for trails.
love this dress for casual or the dress of the night
"Totally tailored, fasionable fit that snugs nicely across the hips and drapes very clean and comfortable down the leg. Have been trying since arrival to get a picture but they're obviously comfortable enough that movement can't be slowed!"
"Hard to replace my old one but it was ruined by moisture.  I travel a lot and need something safe to carry my jewelry in.  This was perfect, as well as pretty.  It is soft with all the necessary pockets and in my opinion, far superior to a leather traveling case."
"I love this.  It's a perfect length - long, but not too long.  It's thin/lightweight, but feels durable.  I would definitely buy more of these."
"The straps are worthless, they are basically elastic string and whether you are heavy or small on top they offer ZERO support. the length is great, I am 5'6"" and it falls just below the knees. The material is nice, not too thick and not sheer thin. It provides ample support all over, but it will not disguise a belly budge. Suck in your belly button girls!

I took my dress to a seamstress to have the straps replaced and the cleavage gap closed a little. It's too baring for my taste and you can see whatever bra you are wearing under it.

I suggest a strapless bra and no show panties or commando. Have a friend around in case you need assistance zipping it up."
"I was looking for knee high boots in grey and I was lucky to find these pair of boots. I'm 6'2"" tall and these boots fall right down my knee (it's not exactly the knee but it works for me). I bought size 12 although I'm size 11 (I was not sure if size 11 would work so I preferred to have some buffer; although a size 11 might have fit well, size 12 fits good since I wear socks with them). Regarding the 2 zippers, I wasn't very convinced, but they look nice! I'm ~15"" calves and the boot opening is just perfect; it's not needed to use the 2nd zipper. The material looks nice but after some wearing you would start seeing that the feet part is kind of marked (like wrinkles where you flex your feet), I would say that's the only non very positive comment I had; otherwise than that, you would love them :)"
Bought this for my neighbor and she loves it. Nice and lightweight but not flimsy.
One size fits all
Very soft very nice
"I was not sure how I was going to feel about these but I actually like them. I am 5'10 and 140lbs and I ordered these in a medium and they fit perfectly. Surprisingly, they are long enough on me. Usually when I buy leggings they are too short and I have to wear tall boots with them but these are actually long enough to where I can tuck them in to my ankle boots. Nice and stretchy and hold extra belly fat in place. You can sort of see every lump on your leg through them though, so if you have cellulite, that may show through."
Nice to keep feet warm in winter months.
"Because I'm a 5'11"" man and still decided to try and wear this.  Long story short, I succeeded!  Speaking of short, I suppose this sweater is a bit on the short side for me, but a man could easily fit into this if you are looking to win a bad sweater contest (I did!)

Expect fuzz everywhere, however."
"Durable, functional, and fashionable.  These are excellent quality belts.  And they are inexpensive enough to get a few that match everything."
nice - came in handy for christmas contest
"I got this for my granddaughter who hauls around plastic bags and a back pack every where she goes. She loves this bag, says it's perfect. It has lots  of pockets with zippers, the size is just not too big and not too small, and the colors are great. I also like the fact that the inside is sturdy and the bag has 2 size straps. The price is well below what I paid for other tote bags not as good as this one. I'm getting a couple of more before they discover how popular these are and the price goes up."
"very well made, great colors, fast shipping."
"You get what you pay for. It is okay, though, and my son loves it. The pocket ripped a little, and I fixed it before it got too bad. But he wears it every day, so it was worth it. I bought a size 'large' for him, and he normally wears adult medium in men's clothes. I'm really glad I read the other reviews and bought one size larger.
If I had a choice, I would buy it again.

UPDATE: The zipper pull fell off and he's very disappointed. :/ I tried buying replacement zipper pulls but they didn't work right. I might try another one I found in a catalog."
"it took forever to get, but it is a great necklace."
Height 175 cm and weight of 70 kg. M size just right.
"Shipped quick, fit was as expected due to size chart, quality is good and feels comfortable.  Color is good and not too overbearing."
I bought this adorable costume for my 2 1/2 year old girl who wears size 3 and it fit perfectly.  Quality is good.  Best of all she loved it!!
"very nice shirt. I've been buying Hanes large  undershirts, but they're rather short and I have to stretch them to tuck them in. These Fruit of the Loom shirts are much longer in the body for easy tucking.

In addition, I prefer the texture of the Fruit of the Loom shirt (smooth, silky feeling cotton) vs. the Hanes shirt (rougher cotton texture).

As you can see, I think the Fruit of the Loom shirt is better than the Hanes shirt. To top it off, they also cost less."
"ordered these twice in a 8.5/9 and received a 6.5/7 both times, the card board holder stated the right size and the shoe showed the smaller size which it was, however this was only in the white.  I ordered another color and it was perfect, 5 stars."
Value - quality construction - comfortable - NOT binding. I would have given 5 stars had the material been thicker/heavier. I WILL buy this again.
"Nicely simple, good leather, with a rounded toe."
The top fits as well as I had hoped it would.  I am satisfied.
"I purchased this for my comic-book nerd boyfriend and he absolutely loves it.  It has stitching!  That's what he keeps saying.  I guess because the stars and stripes are sewn rather than printed, it's a big deal for him.  It's made from quality materials, it hasn't faded.  The only thing I can say about this t-shirt if that if you're waffling between sizes, go with the larger.  It doesn't stretch out over time."
Love them.  Not excited that they are slightly see thru but a long sweater fixes that problem. Comfy warm material.  Quick delivery!  Satisfied. Thanks :)
Really big bag
"Did what it need to do, good buy"
"If you are looking for a well made comfortable pair of shoes, you can't go wrong with this pair. You will not be disappointed. Whether you are walking, jogging, or running these shoes are a perfect match. You feel like you are walking on air, and have pep in your step. And what's not to love about the color?"
"It is comfortable, for me. The sleeves are within the average proportional lengths. I find that I really appreciate the freedom my limbs have. Sleep well and feel sufficiently modest."
My daughter wanted this for school instead of a backpack and she loves it.
Excellent!! Just what i wanted!
It fits my baby aclittle big but hes 4 months so bu the time its Halloween in a month my baby most likely fit.
"Ive only worn these shoes once but they seemed comfortable. The colors are perfect for the summer. I gave them 4 stars only because the material is a little more plastic like then expected and tends rub your feet a little, but that is fixable by adjusting the straps. Otherwise they look great and definitely the right price!"
"Love these! These are my work shoes (I am a nurse), and I wouldn't wear anything else. I get tons of compliments. I started wearing these years ago, after finding that sneakers/running shoes just didn't give my feet the support they need. My feet feel great with them on, and they still feel good after 12 hours. The uppers are breathable, and keep my feet cooler than they ever were with any running shoes. They are a little pricey, but well worth the money! Take care of your feet, and they will take care of you!"
Very happy with the hat.  Lightweight and comfortable
"Fits very well, but is thin.  Definitely need to wear something under the dress"
Really love it!
"I've purchased the Fruit of the Loom Men's Pocket T Undershirts a few times, and I'll keep buying them as long as they don't change. I'm generally a Jeans and T Shirts kind of person, and I can get away with wearing these as my everyday shirts because of the various colors and the pocket. They don't look like underwear. Above all else, the Fruit of the Loom Men's Pocket T Undershirts are light weight and comfortable! I don't do hot weather very well, and I'm outdoors quite often. The regular T Shirts hanging on the store racks are nice, as are the multi-packs of white cotton T's, but they're just too darn heavy for me. I highly recommend the Fruit of the Loom 4 pack of Men's Pocket Tees."
This is so cute and pretty! I'm 4'11 109lbs and this is just so perfect for me. I love it. I hope this will last ;)
"HEAVENLY SANDALS, BOUGHT ANOTHER PAIR IN CREAM - LOVE THEM"
"This is a beautiful citrus-y, summery scent; very light and youthful. I really love this. It goes on light and bright, and has good staying power. I think as the afternoon wore on it mellowed into a slightly more mature scent, but nothing heavy or overly sexy. It reminds me of the Colors by Benneton scent, but a little brighter.  The bottle is classy and stable, and my one caveat was that it arrived to me from Amazon with a dented box. It was obviously just tossed in a cardboard box where it had room to slide around and get dented. Since perfume is often given as a gift, I thought I would bring that up, since it doesn't look as great for gift-giving as it would if you bought it from a brick-and-mortar store where it would presumably be more carefully handled. Still, a lovely scent and great product. I would wear this and give it as a gift."
Great watch for the money. Easy to remove links in bracelet if necessary. Light hands and dark background make it easy to see the time.
It was  a perfect gift my husband loved it
"Got these as a gift for our kids. They're super-handy to slip on every time you need to do some chore like get the mail, take out the trash, etc. They wash up in the washing machine great too."
"Warm, looks good, brim is a nice feature."
I love this glasses. I was looking for a polarized glasses that were not too expensive and that look good. The glasses are light weight and have a nice shape.
"i like the price and the quality is great for the price. it shines bright, gem looks like cz but it again wasn't expensive. color won't turn!! would get for any special outting!!"
i love them really comfortables. i would buy them again..
"Fits as expected, material is soft and nice. Print is cute and not cheaply done. Would buy again in the future."
"Suprisingly it has some very nice weight to it. I have always been an XL and does fit for an XL, but it is a bit snug. Otherwise i loved it"
It's kinda big like other people where saying but I love it.. All I wanna do is wear my robe around the house.. Great feel..
"Excellent comfort. Not your old Fruit of the Loom underwear. I have to say these are more comfortable than my Hanes, Calvin Klein, Dockers, and H&M underwear."
"I purchased this luggage to take with me on an 18 day luxury cruise to the South Pacific and I must say I am very happy with this buy. Although I did not need the smallest piece, my daughter and I did need to get two luggage sets as we used the two largest pieces from each set and we packed just what we wanted and needed.

This luggage set is very well built. You the buyer need not worry about the ability of the luggage to hold up to the stress of whatever handling it will receive in transit from airport to airport, etc. The look of the luggage is fantastic and the price cannot be beat. It is difficult for me to imagine that I paid less than three hundred dollars for this set as I feel that I should have paid much more for the quality and look of this superior luggage set.

Luggage is a requirement when doing some travel and your luggage will get beat up and will not look new after as little as one trip to and from your destination. It is helpful to have an understanding when purchasing nice luggage that your fantastic looking brand-new luggage doesnt look that way anymore after just one flight. I expected this going in because some of the luggage reviews here listed complaints along that line. This London Fog luggage set has the right color to hide some of the wear and tear it will get being tossed about on your vacation or business trip. It is the quality of the build that is most important. The material is nice and thick as are the zippers that hold everything together. This luggage will stand the test of time and you will be very happy with the way it moves while you are scooting it along the airport terminals. It rolls very smoothly with little effort, and that my friends is the one bonus that you will truly appreciate in transit. Nothing worse than luggage that wears you down while you try to move it and yourself through corridor after corridor at the airports.

London Fog is rugged, glides smoothly along with you while you walk, looks amazing--making you look better (eat your heart out), costs you very little to own, and is easy to find at the baggage claim because you are the only person at the airport that day with luggage that dashing!"
"This military style parachute cargo bag is well made. It is made of heavy duty canvas material and the zipper and straps are heavy duty as well, but it is light in weight and will fold up small for storage when not in use. It should stand up to years of abuse without damage.
The size is generous, and can hold more then I figured it would since the sides are flexible.
There are also two small D-Rings located near each end of the zipper for adding a shoulder strap if needed. However no shoulder strap is included, which would have been nice.
Also there is no way to lock the bags. Having a larger zipper pull tab with a hole in it that would have allowed for someone to but a simple padlock between that and one of the D-Rings would have been nice to help secure the contents, but if anyone really wanted this, they would probably just grabbed the bag a ran. So I did not see this as a downside, but some may.
Also you can get this bag in several different colors. If you are not choosy as to the color, check each for price the price. I purchased the tan version for several $$ less than most of the other colors."
I wanted a white tallis; I am happily surprised at the quality and simple beauty of this for the unbelievable price.
The kids boy tie is too small for a child more for toddlers
Nice shoulder bag with plenty of compartments and room.  Love the color too!
I bought these from a local store on an impulse and tried them on at home with numerous outfits and fell in love!  Because I had an amazon gift card I returned them to the store and ordered them from amazon.  They fit true to size for me.  I love that they go with so many different outfits!
love leggings my first time wearing and definitely will order more in a variety of colors .... to replace my jeans ... but a different brand  very slimming and flattering
Compared to Hanes red tag and extra soft t-shirts this is the best bang for your buck. This t-shirts feel just as soft and durable as more expensive ones.
Gorgeous! I want them in all sizes!
"Runs small in the band, cups are perfect."
These boots are awesome!  I've had so much trouble finding boots for my skinny calves.  These were a pretty good fit without having to have custom made!
Love these shoes! Very comfortable and gives me the support I need. I wear them mostly for walking.
"Around Christmas, there was a Gold Box Special on these. I bought two different kinds.  These are the most comfortable slippers I've ever had. Easy-wearing inside and out for quick trips to the grocers or to get gas.  Sturdy and keep my feet warm."
"Beautiful shoes. I would give a 4.5 out of 5 stars just because I don't think their sizing is completely true to size. I wear a size 7.5/8 and these size I'm 8 definitely feel more like 7.5. They squeeze ever so slightly around the toes. However, I've only worn them for a day and they will probably stretch out a bit. The memory foam insole is so comfortable! The turquoise is a beautiful color and I love how thin the soles are, visually. I don't mean that they are bad quality, I am just not a fan of ""clonky"" sneakers. I bought these mainly for walking, not hiking or running, so they are perfect for my needs, while looking really cute. And I got them for under $25 so that's a win all-around."
Good for the fall/spring.  Have snow sneakers for the winter.
"This is a  perfect peice to add to my collection, I ordered more than one as it  was such a good price, I thought that would be perfect to put in a stocking for christmas for next year."
"soft fabric, cut right so cover up hangs well. I liked this one."
great product and excellent quality fit my passports
"LOVE the CK Modern Cotton Bralettes. They're safely the most comfortable bras I've ever worn. I personally am not very large-chested, so they provide enough support for me, but I could imagine how it would not be enough support for someone who is larger-chested. The material is high quality and it's a fashionable bralette. I have a number of these bralettes in different colors, and I wear them almost every day because they're that comfortable and versatile."
Love them! So comfy and so warm. Fit exactly as expected.
Kept everything organized and folded.  There was no rummaging through suit cases. Buy different colors for each person.  At first I thought they looked small but this size was good for Capri pants folded in half and jeans in thirds.
"Fantastic band!
Easy install, looks great!
Seems to be paying a while, too- I've been wearing it daily for 3+ months"
"it is not mine , i bought it for my friend as a gift,, she likes it and said it did fit,"
It is just like  I wanted.  I'm a large woman and wanted a large sarong to help cover up when I come off the beach or out of the pool.  This sarong is great!  May end up buying more in different colors.
"It is an imitation of the dress posted in the photo. How could I tell? Initially I didn't notice until I saw that the sleeves are different. In the photo, it looked like 2 layers of clothing, but the dress I received didn't have that look. I was a little disappointed, but the dress cost me so little regardless and is very cute. It is one size fit all, so it looks quite wide on me, but I still received many compliments from people."
"Would suggest you order bigger size than what you wear. Cute shirt if you're ""ferret crazy"". Family member really liked it as gift."
My husband loves these jeans.  They hold up well in his profession as a welder and are comfortable too.  Great turnaround for the shipping.  Highly recommend this seller.  Price was fair too.
"I had extremely high hopes for the shoes based on reviews.  They are comfortable to wear, the elastic around the shoe does not cut into my heal like some similar flats I have had in the past. There was no breaking in required. I would have given them 5 stars except that is little padding which makes walking in them all day not ideal. I still like them and would recommend, just be aware they may not work if you are on your feet all day."
"This is pretty much the perfect winter under shirt for me. It doesn't add a lot of bulk while adding a layer of warmth, and the neckline is low enough to either not be seen or to look polished under my winter dresses and sweaters."
"I will have to wait until the dead of winter to wear this, because it's soooooo warm, but it's surely cute!  Very nice, and you do get a significant product for the money.  I love the styles presented by this company, just have to find something flattering and lighter!"
I found the white to be a bit see through and wear nude underwear with the....I also bought them in black.
LOTS of compliments and figure flattering.
very good they lasted long
"Love these, great color, fits as expected and is comfortable!  I tried buying a cheaper brand/version first as I wasn't sure how often I would wear blue suede - but I returned those and bought these instead - definitely worth the money!!!"
Love this romper. It came super wrinkled so don't expect to wear it the day you get it. But it is fabulous!
Beautiful but not for someone under 5'6. Fits beyond oversized.
"I bought this hat in California when on vacation. Totally love the look & feel. Very cool in warm weather. Bought the same style in waterproof canvas. Plan to get a dark color for winter in NY. It fits perfect, and always getting comments on how well I look in it, & where can I get one.  Thank you Dorfman Pacific Company for making high quality & great looking hats."
Bought the wide very comfortable
"These are really great underwear. A little more money than cheaper ones but these are the best fitting, comfortable, best construction and can hold up after washing many times."
This scarf is very thin but perfect as an accessory to an outfit!
Absolutely beautiful necklace! Real silver. Comes with a lovely box and cleaning cloth. Very pleased with purchase.
Great shoes.  My daughter really likes them
legendary Seiko quality!!  im very happy!
I like everything about this umbrella.  The multi color gives it a very feminine look. I was looking for a light weight.  The flashlight makes it even more interesting. I should buy this instead of that expensive Galleria which did not last too long and it was heavy too.
Great feel and great fit - love everything about them and will be buying more
Exactly what i expected!
Great for the price. I would get it again. Fits as expected
"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THESE!!!"
Great price for what you get.
"I purchased my first pair of Lazy One's a few years ago in Montana, in a mountain gift shop. I now have several of them. This year everyone is getting a pair for their birthday. They're durable, wash well, whimsy and for the quality, very well priced."
"Comfy, sturdy, just wish rubber sole was more giving/ shock absorbing"
"Awesome! Foot is a little large, but they are super comfy & super cute."
Perfect fit!! Great shoe
beautiful set looks very  classy i love the set
"My kids like the orange and gray design of the shirt. It has stripes that look cool and they love wearing it.

This is an athletic shirt made of 100% polyester which makes it dry quickly. The shirt drying quickly is good for sports.

The fit is an athletic fit which is fitted and slim but it does run true to size."
I got this shirt for my mother-in-law and it was a bit small for her. She still wears it but she likes her shirts a bit larger.
"It arrived quickly and nicely packaged, I don't think the picture did it justice it looks so much prettier in real life! I ordered my usual size and it fits good."
"Really nice and fits perfectly, and the hoodie is attached with buttons instead of a zipper which is nice"
"I ordered these shoes for my son and the size was perfect and the shipping was fast, only if my post office would have gotten it to me on time I had to go to my post office and pick them up because they had them there and wouldn't ship them out yet but other then that my son loves these shoes he says they are comfortable and he runs great in them there not to tight which is the problem we have had in the past I would recommend these to any soccer player."
Great wallet. Perfect for traveling.
Nice men's pants
The only scrubs I wear.
I wear these for work as a nurse and this style is accepted due to lack of holes. Crocs are the most comfortable shoes I've ever tried for work and casual days off. At this price I picked up several pairs.
"I take a medium large.  The definitely shrink after washing.  But, these caps are soft and comfortable!!  You do not even know you have them on.  Even though they shrink after washing, they still give you the coverage you need. And shrinkage is minimal.  I do put them in the dryer.  I bet if you hand wash, and lay out to air dry, they won't shrink.  I love them 100%!!  I wear them out, and I wear them to bed. They give you many colors to chose from.  A+++++++"
my daughter loved it uses it for dress up
Nice dress and lovely fabric. It fits as expected
"Bought to wear with a sage Green suit for a presentation, lots of compliment. The price was excellent."
"This is a standard t-shirts, generous in size.  Washed well.  The only issue is the image and description is for a heathered kelly green shirt and the shirt that arrived is a solid dark kelly green.  The design is also not distressed, just a standard solid color screen print."
Skirt is just what I was looking for to wear on a casual summer day.  The shape and fabric are flattering to the figure and I like the length
They are beautiful. Have gotten lots of compliments.
My granddaughter loves it.  She owns 6 of these now.
"Fit perfect, no issues ."
"Must have for a Ricky outfit. Paired it with all the other accoutrements [watch, chain, track pants, sideburns and cigs] for a big costume party and was only recognized by a random stranger in a gas station. Totally worth it.
Shirt fit me a little snug, but worse case Ontario it's a reminder to lay off the dirty burgers."
So far I am LOVING this bra! I am still pregnant so I haven't used it for nursing just yet but as far as fit I was nervous when it arrived bc it looks like it is gonna be big but it's so perfect. So comfortable just what I needed in my life right now.
My first corest ever. I'm 5'3 160 pounds. I ordered a medium. For the first hour I was acidentley wore the corest upside down! figured out how to correctly wear it and now am seasoning properly! The corest is a tad small but I'll break it in! Very satisfied customer!  :)
One glove was sewn at a slight angle and was difficult to keep it straight... still worked out great.
"I love, love, love my new ring.  I lost mine a few weeks ago and needed a temporary since my wedding ring is way to small.  This fits perfect, sparkles a ton and represents my family tradition.  The only thing I would say I don't like it that the band and engagement ring don't click together so they slide out of place a lot."
"Very comfortable, and soft.  Unfortunately does not offer arch support."
This bracelet stand looks pretty nice on the top of my dresser. It holds quite a few bracelets and you can see them well to pick one out. I've wanted to put my bracelets out where I can see them for a while but didn't know how to do it. Braclets can take up alot of space if you put them in boxes and if you want to separate them to see them. This black velvet stand looks elegant and makes your braces look nice and they're all in one place so you can find them. Each rod easily comes off to remove the bracelet you want and you can easily set it back down into the stand. I purchase this product at a discount in return for an honest review. I'm enjoying it and it's working well for my bracelets. The only negative comment I have is it was not packaged very well in the box and the packaging it was holding it was torn. This didn't hurt the product at all but wouldn't have looked very good if it had been a gift.
"How sad is this... These are so nice, soft & comfy.  I bought white, gray and black.  I know myself so well.... I bought 2 pair of white knowing I would get something on them; had to make sure I had a backup pair!  LOL. Yes, well worth the money!"
Great fit but a little thin. Not see through.
"these jeans fit like a glove without being tight...i am not overweight and have a small waist, so other jeans are always too big in the waist and usually in the thigh/legs as well..these fit very slim and look great!  the waist is also higher, which is more flattering. the material is stretchy as well and after laundering, did not stretch out of shape. please order one size down from what you ordinarily wear. i wear a size 6 normally and ordered these in a size 4 - and they fit like a 6. these jeans arrived packaged very nicely and on time!"
"Good good good good good good good good good good
You would probably get more reviews without these silly word count restrictions"
"I started buying Rockport Oxfords on Amazon a couple of pairs ago and after the first pair, won't buy anywhere else.  Great, comfortable shoes, good quality, good price and with Amazon Prime, they arrive in 2 days - I walk much everyday at work and these are holding up well.
I'm not a huge fan of this particular pair only because the black shoe with light strip above the sole - looked cool in the pictures but, in person they look more like I should be wearing them on the golf course or with jeans and not with slacks - still look cool but, not quite dressy enough for my work clothes.

Overall, lightweight, very comfortable (I usually have to buy 13M locally due to lack of choice but, with the choice of sizes, a 12E or 12 Wide is actually perfect for me), feet stay cool, and the soles seem to be holding up well."
Looks beautiful when worn.
I have always loved overalls- these run a little on the large side so even  if you think you want them a little bigger order your normal size. The only thing I'm not crazy about is the weird flat clasps- I'm not sure they will hold up long.
Very cute; have to wear with insert in right shoe for now... size on left fits perfectly. Have not ever had a problem with asymmetric fitting shoes.
"they arrived an hour or so ago, so far, very comfortable."
It is the same bra I always buy.  Does the job..
Great purchase for Hubby!
"Timex has been making good watches for a long time.  This model is no exception.  Although it is sold as a women's watch, it is a perfect fit for my wrist.

The dial is simple with twelve large easy-to-read numbers for the hours.  It has an hour hand, a minute hand and a second hand.  Pushing the stem illuminates the dial for night viewing.  The watch keeps good time.  It also comes with a nice light band, which breathes well.  This is a simple but functional watch."
"these socks are great, they do shed a bit of material upon first wear and wash but they hold up better in the long run than most as I'm on my feet nearly all day for work"
"I bought a medium because I'm normally a medium. I could get into it, but it was reeeeally tight. My friend loved the shorts so much though, that she bought them off me! Then I bought a L, and that was barely any bigger which was weird. In the end I settled on an XL which was still form fitting. I washed the shorts today for the first time, and they came out of the wash exactly the same size, looking as though they'd been ironed. LOVE! The fit is great and it's quite comfy. The white is a bit see-through.. not terribly, but out of the black, denim and white I bought I'm choosing the black and denim."
Hope these last because they are perfect for wide feet. They seem well made. So hard to find a wide foot rain/muck boot. Held up great so far but it's only been a few weeks of occasional use.
"Was having trouble with underwires in bras, and these fixed that immediately! Very soft and comfortable to wear all day."
Refreshing application and finish after applying Jane Iredale foundation.  Great product
Wish the lope end was a little bit biggerit's hard to  latch .
My son picked them out and finds them to be comfortable.
"Great fitting and works as expected with touchscreens.  This glove really shines with increased wind, I barely even notice it with these on."
This is my 3rd pair of the Hayla sandals; they are my favorites.  From the moment I put them on to the end if a long day - they feel great!  I highly recommend them.
"BEAUTIFUL COLOR, FIT, AND STYLE"
I love this shirt!! The fit is perfect and the fabric feels great. I have a few other Patty Boutik shirts and this one is by far my favorite
Nice fit and adorable for any little minion fan.
Gorgeous glasses! I get compliments daily!
"Perfect!  I've been impressed with Thorlo socks for decades, but hadn't used them in a while because I no longer hike in the hardcore style of my youth; however, I do use hiking boots for working around the yard, which slopes down to a lake behind my house, so I want good, dry traction.  I considered Thorlo, but remembered that, if anything, they had TOO MUCH padding in the past.  These were advertised as lightly padded and they are very comfortable without making my foot feel jammed in a shoe that fits me correctly but doesn't leave much spare room."
Beautiful dress for my 5 year old! She was a hit at the princess party and she was not the celebrant!
"I have a mixed feelings about this sandals. They are well made, good stitching so my son wears them without the socks and never had problems with blisters. They are durable as well - survived jumping in the puddles,  digging in sand and washing them after. BUT oh boy, they made my son's feet SO smelly,  brrrr. It was never a case with other shoes."
Super cute boot.  Great value.  Lots of compliments.
I saw this shoe on sale in Fashion Mall in Las Vegas and their was selling this shoe for $60 and I got them for $35 on Amazon. I actually stood in the store and order the shoe online. They feel wonderful. Soft and is true to size! You will not go wrong with this purchase. I bought 2 pair!
Yeah! I'm a lov.er of this brand shoes
"I was afraid these shoes wouldn't fit, I'm a size 10 with wide feet, but they fit wonderfully and they! My feet even look smaller. I will be buying the blue pair soon. I haven't walked around in them yet, but I'm hopeful."
great product. works as expected. terrific quality.
She loves them.  If they get dirty they wipe off clean really easily.
Comfortable and worth the price
"I ordered these so you would no longer see my bra straps when I wear mt tank tops some of them have an odd shape I just had rotator-cuff surgery so my wardrobe for a while will be tank tops.  They work wonderfully, they are very comfortable and they do help with your posture.  My sister has stolen 2 of them I am very happy and so is she I highly recommend these!!!!"
Love love love this jumper!!! Super cute and the way more comfy than ever expected!
"This is a lovely design and execution, especially at the price. The fabric is light but not see through and lays very nicely.  I can wear this to work or just out with friends. I'm quite pleased!"
"I have recently introduced my husband to sweaters.  He swore he would never wear one.  After putting this on, he has realized how nice and warm a sweater can be.  His birthday is coming and I'm planning to buy another one from the KingSize catalog."
"This bra was great especially for the price.  The fabric is sturdy, based on the reviews i ordered a medium but it was a bit big, next one will be a samll for sure (i wear a 34C bra (after padding).  It lost a star becasue the straps are not adjsutable but to be honest most sports bras don't have adjustable straps"
"Great looking shoes and very comfortable too, I usually have trouble with the fitting of the shoes but these went just like a glove"
I love my Tilley TW2!  I get compliments on the look and it serves its main purpose of keeping my head warm.  I was able to use the ear flap this past week and it kept my ears and the back of my neck warm as I expected it to.  I would suggest this hat to anyone looking for style and warmth.
A little big but really nice.  Light weight.
"Okay, this says it is a 3/4 sleeve but it is definitely long-sleeved. It is comfortable. It looks great with jeans. It is loose and blousy and it is chic. I wouldn't have bought this for myself but now that I have it I will definitely wear it. It is stylish -- better than a plain old t-shirt."
"This dress is a steal at $20. Wore it to an event & got a ton of compliments. If you are chesty, they will be on display (but hey, what else are the girls to do, amiright?).  ;)  I almost felt awkward telling people it was a $20 dress, because you know your response to a compliment is the obligatory ""thanks, I got it at <insert store name> for $$"".  It's a wee short too, but it shows off those great legs ya got! Honestly, it's a great little dress & doesn't look/feel cheap."
Good size for my jewelry that I am making.
"Boots were a little stiff at first, but after wearing for about a week they broke in nicely. I work in very hazardous work area with extreme chemicals. These boots are now over a year & a half old and still going strong! Great workmanship & materials! I would definitely recommend these and may be buying another pair if this pair ever wears out."
"The final verdict is still out, but so far she is impressed with her skin after treatment. If this replaces actual spa visits, it will be well worth the money. I can tell a little bit of difference, but her friends can see it even more after about a week. She likes the fact that she can do this at home without spending the time in town at the spa. I like that it will be a cheaper alternative over the long run. It is easy to use and she thinks it will be a good investment for her skin care ""plan"". As long as it works, I'm happy."
"I have this top in lots of colors in both short and long sleeves. I've been wearing them for about 4 years and I still love them. I really like the deep V-neck. The material can be see-through when it's stretched. If you are busty, you may be able to see your bust area through the shirt. Fits like Juniors sizes to me.

Bought it for my boyfriend and he uses it for work. Loves it!
"Our daughters dressed as princesses for Halloween, and they loved these. The wings were a bit big on our 2 1/2 year old, but all was fine for our 4 1/2 year old."
Nice fit..Nice Material...
Love! Took me awhile to find the original trefoil design I love the best from Adidas. Will purchase again in another color.
I ordered two of these and wore them constantly after giving birth - they hide the postpartum belly quite well while allowing for easy nursing.
fit 75kg
"Excellent graphics, good fit , arrived fast. I will buy again."
"I had been wanting these shoes for a while and when I found them for such a great price I decided it was time to purchase them.  They arrived very quickly and on time of course.  The fit was perfect, but I did do some research on Converse sizing before I purchased.  I am glad I did because it's recommended to go about half a size down which is what I did.  I am very happy with the shoes and the seller."
"Good quality shirts.  I've purchased every color available and am more than satisfied with the fit, fabric and look.  Very comfortable and warm, and good for layering in the cold months."
"My wifes new Rolex, what can I say!"
"This is a great shirt with a very nice secret pocket that would be near impossible to pickpocket. It looked a tiny bit nerdy on me (like I was going on a safari) so I opted to leave it behind in favor of a Royal Robin shirt that had a nice secret pocket as well. Still, I love this shirt and I am certain that it will accompany me on a journey sometime in the future. It is a comfortable and secure travel shirt and I look forward to the right trip to wear it on."
"this is advertised for a kid but it also fits adults, was a pretty full wig.  Did the job though and my child looked great."
"This was a gift for a friend who is on his feet all day as a personal trainer, but he reports that he is immensely pleased with the fit and durability.  Absolutely no complaints."
Great looking watch in a large dial diameter.  Will look good on any man's wrist.
I haven't worn them out yet but they feel comfortable and warm in the house.
Consider the next size up! Other than that is an excellent choice.
"Bought this for my granddaughter.  Love the style, color, fit, quality and ease of putting on. Her mom misplaced this pair and I ended up ordering another pair next size up.  Testament to my satisfaction of the shoes and the manufacturer."
"Like the bronzy metallic finish on these, cushiony insole.  Like the height of the shoe. Could use just a little more length in the ankle straps, even though adjustable, could use another few mm of length.  But cute and fairly comfortable.  Especially like the extra wide width."
Love the style and fit. I had another pair that I wore for years that held up great.
Really nice and soft . Kinda feels like a flannel. Not as big as I would have liked it. But it's nice and I'm going to keep it!
Super fashionable!
It's  not what I expected. I was thinking it was going to be a thick warm sweater and it is the opposite.
Good quality fabric. Cute grey sweater. Fits as expected
I love these shoes! They are light weight and so comfortable! They are considered a relaxed fit. I normally wear a size 7 but in these I wear a 6 1/2.
"Perfect, haven't taken them off since I arrived."
"Substantial knit, about as heavy as the Dickies, but while the fabric of the Dickies is very close-knit and somewhat stiff, the Carhartt's are softer, more supple. They are also not cut as narrowly as the Dickies. The Carhartt's seem like a true L/T, while the Dickies are too narrow. Good colors and nice pocket."
"Good quality but the ears are not bendable , they are glued to the hat. I got lots of laughs wearing it at work on easter"
Beautiful shoe. True to size. Buy it
"This is a very cute suit. The way the straps are made, they stay on perfectly."
I bought this as a gift for my son.  He said he loves these sneakers. He works out regularly and coaches.  He said they are very comfortable and durable.
Nice jacket for the price!
"Bigger than I thought, but they work."
"The only reason I am giving these 4 stars instead of 5 is because they are not comfortable with my bunions.  If you have bunions, these are not the shoes for you."
"Jeans fit my husband, finally. His jeans have been baggy all our married life. When I buy regular fit jeans in the dept. stores, they are always baggy. One of my friends said that she buys her husband the slim fit. So, I decided to try that too. We are very pleased with this slimmer fitting jean & will be buying more of them in the future!"
"So far so good!  I've never had any type of wallet, and after reading the reviews and as well as noticing the product itself looked very nice and looked of very good quality, I decided to give it a try.  One reason was to get the RFID benefit, due to upcoming travels, I felt I better protect my cards/ID better.
After having received it and using it for the past couple of weeks now I can say it has taken some getting used to.  I""ve always used a tri-fold type mostly throughout my life.
This Money clip type wallet definitely does not hold as much as my old billfolds, but it has allowed me to eliminate the unnecessary cards and crap that I used to carry around for basically no reason, other than ""it might come in handy some day"" reason.  Lame right.  Every man can realte I'm sure, right?
Getting used to it is coming along nicely, and the wallet is loosening up little by little as I use it daily.  The first several days I could barely get the cards back out from the two card slots on either side, but I do have them pretty much to capacity.  The product info indicates that each of the two slots holds up to six cards, which is about right, but like I said they are in there pretty tight, but slots are indeed loosening up as the real genuine leather gets broken in and sat on (in my pocket) and whatnot.
I love the look of the leather and I've already gotten a few compliments on it as well."
Looks Great! Fits Great!
Absolutely love this swimming suit! It is seriously my favorite Ive ever owned! After having my son I have yet to lose the weight around my stomach and this seriously helps cover it all and doesnt make me feel frumpy!
"I purchased this before Christmas as a present and many washes later, it is still holding up well. Would definitely buy again."
"Great boots! Comfy, warm and stylish! Would recommend for sure."
"Love these Keen hikers.  They are replacing the Koven Keen hikers that I had bought at a sporting goods store which I didn't like as well.  The Voyageur has a bit wider toe base which is what I need.  The inserts I remove and use my own orthotic inserts.  These hikers are sturdy and comfortable which are the two big criteria I look for in any shoe.  Based on previous Voyageurs I've had, these should last me for a good long while."
Does the trick! Well constructed!
"This lock is sturdy, convenient, and in accord with current regulations for baggage. It is not complicated to use. I think most travellers would find it well-suited to their needs."
"I loved this 'bra' when I first put it on; but after owning SEVERAL for about a month, I started wondering if I shouldn't try the size down for more support! I'll be updating this review once it arrives, since I wouldn't want to ding this on lack of support if it's my own fault for choosing the wrong size. :)"
look darling and very soft.. Fast shipping
My daughter says they feel like she is wearing slippers!
"Fit is perfect. Made very well I use in wet area of gym (sauna, steam, whirlpool, and swimming pool.) Look great."
"Bought these running shoes for the gym, figured they would also be good for the treadmill too. My first impression on trying them on was how lightweight and comfortable they were. I used additional support due to my high arches and i have had no discomfort at all while using them. Purchased my size, 7 1/2 and with socks on, the fit is perfect. The colour was consistent with the image and Im very happy with my purchase."
Good quality jeans.  Will be purchasing more.
"I am a 'chain snob'.  I have to find the perfect chain for every new pendant that I purchase.  More times than not, I order a Vinani snake chain.  The quality is impeccable and the style brings out the best in almost any pendant.  I love the choice of lengths and widths.  They are very well priced.  I have never been disappointed."
Good ole standard. I'm glad they haven't changed. Exact pants I've been buying in the store for more money.
"A lot of people say that this is big, but it fitted my husband's big head perfectly.  He likes it and  I'm glad I ordered two."
These socks are well made and of great material. Im 5'4 and the fit to my mid knee.
"Really great boot for someone with skinny legs. This particular boot hugs your calf and shin. From my experience FRYE always fits as expected. LOVE them.
Thank you"
Bough these as a gift for my nephew and they were exactly as described.
"I wish I knew about this kit uears ago, it could've saved dozens of white shoes I owned. This takes minimal effort and turned my shoes around in minutes! I have bought many kits in stores but after using this I will never go back!"
"These were so nice and stretched in all directions which made a terrific fit. they don't ride up or down, do not pinch or cut into your skin. It was like heaven wearing them."
Love that this doesnt have GIANT face and it a perfect size for a woman! Easy to use. Love the navy and silver together. Perfect for sports.
These shoes were delivered one evening and I wore them the next day.  Quite comfortable and very stylish.  I received numerous compliments on them.  I would highly recommend these shoes - I'd buy them in different colors.
no more truth could be spoken
"I was browsing Amazon for Christmas presents when I came across these next level T-shirts. During the summer months, I wear a different T-shirt every day. I used to be a guy you see in the gray or tan T-shirt walking down the street. My wife couldn't figure out why my T-shirts were either tan or gray and asked me to loosen up and put some color in my life. I gave it some consideration and I decided maybe it was time for a change. Several years ago I began purchasing T-shirts in various colors. When I saw the rainbow of colors available from Next Level, I decided the royal blue and the Kelly green T-shirts were good colors for me. To date, I've worn a green shirt, I've washed it and still fits. The material has a good feel and it drapes well for my somewhat overweight body. I tree treat clothing items like shorts, T-shirts and pants as commodities and I look for the best value for my dollar. When I purchased the two Next Level T-shirts, they happen to be a good value so I bought them. As it turns out, the quality of the shirts, the fit of the shirts and the feel of the shirts make them a great value."
"I got this for him for christmas from ""santa"" and he plays with it every day. He talks about how santa makes the greatest toys and that I should talk to him and find out how to get more toys like this from santa lol"
The set is simple and stunning and the color just as pictured. Very pretty
"Like the CK underwear, wearing a very comfortable, I like the brand"
I bought this top to cover my midriff bulge and it works like a charm.  Plenty of pleated fabric to allow it to flow amazingly.  Heavy knit fabric that does not wrinkle easily.
"Great fit!
Geat price!
Great quality!"
It worked for us . It organizes the clothes when you want to carry one carry on for 2 people
Love this organizer! I think it's very good quality for the money.
"Excellent pants!  Love the fit and the fabric. In fact, I like them so much I came back and ordered another pair!  I now have black, gray, brown, royal blue and red!  These are perfect!"
Good value.  Comfortable and fit well.
Nice quality... purchased for costume but these are well made enough to wear out as regular shades.
"I got the large size.  It is 46.5"" long.  It is comfortable.  Is substantial enough to hold my phone's belt clip.  So far so good.  My previous belts (there were many) were leather braided (mostly Dockers brand) and they are always tearing up.  At 1/3 the price for this belt - I'm happy and hope it lasts at least as long as the leather style."
"Nice jacket, the material is a little cheap. It runs large."
Bought this for a male friend for Christmas. He loves it. He tells me that it fits perfectly and soaks up water just fine.
Great slip on shoe that is very comfortable.  Not a lot of grip on the sole but I bought them to wear around the house.
These are priceless if you travel frequently! It is so much more convenient to have all your items separated and in a compact state.
"Great shoes, the fit as expected.  They are extremely light weight and airy"
"I love this luggage!! It's not only lightweight, easy to wheel and stylish, but it's very roomy. I take a lot of trips and was looking for a set that will hold up as my last set literally fell apart. I was very excited when I found this set. It took about 20 mins to remove
the plastic over each suitcase(you can't see it, but read the instructions) and the finish went from a matte to shiny. I'm taking this to Vegas next month and can literally fit everything without a problem. I also like the inside zipper part because it has compartments which my last set didn't have. Highly recommend!!"
"Simple but cute, hope my niece likes it..."
I got tons of compliments on this hat!  Very comfortable and flattering.
"Got my normal size 9 I get in any other shoe, but I have a thicker calf and have had trouble finding a boot of this type to accommodate that.  With this boot I FINALLY found that!!  Legs slides in with ease & fits perfectly, not tight, fits just as it should & so comfortable on my feet.  I love the design too! "
"Love this necklace. So simple, yet it adds so much to an outfit. I wear it all the time."
very comfortable but I have to wear socks for a good fit.
I bought this for a young relative. He and his brother instantly exclaimed in delight when the gift was opened. The mask was easily put on and taken off. The boys have been playing with this a lot. It is a favorite of theirs.
Made a big difference but very heavy.
"I wear these shoes every day in the hospital, without an insert, and I never have an issue with my feet. They look great, they don't squeak on the floors, and the Adidas bottoms really are comfortable. I will buy another pair when I wear these out."
Needed something to carry I-phone 6+ when I do not have pockets.  This fits the bill.  The item arrived on time and exactly as advertised.
I like it but it was alot smaller than i imagined. Oh well. Its still really clear and pretty I just wish it was alot bigger
I got these for a friend and he says they fit perfectly. He lives on a beach and says he also wears them basically everyday.
Used for a costume.  Comfortable.
Love the bag evrythibg is perfect but I wish it was a little smaller but that's not a bad thing just my opinion. Thank you for the fast shipment and the beautiful bag!
Anuschka never fails to satisfy me especially when brand new.
Favorite bra.  Very supportive and it really does improve the appearance of back fat.  Supports the girls nicely.
"Treat yourself, this robe feels like a million bucks on. Be aware that it is one size and tends to be big on a small person. I am 5'3""  and 135 lbs and it I can wrap  it around me almost twice. The length is just below the knee and the sleeves are below the elbow which is short enough to not bet in your way if you are blow drying your hair. Even though it is large on me I don't care because it is so beautiful. If you are talker or a larger size it would be perfect."
"Really comfortable, business casual attire (when you are not entertaining clients)."
I chose a five star rating because the quality of this Nautica belt was exactly what I expected--solid. My five year old was excited for his first 'real' belt.
It's a plastic shield.  Not a whole let t review. My husband loved it and my 7-year old has now confiscated it even though it is bigger than him.
"I have a hard time finding pants that fit correctly and don't slide below my waist as the day goes on.  I have discovered that the best solution for me is pants with 7, not 5 belt loops and an expandable or comfort fit waist band.  Pants with those features are slightly snug around the waist when I put them on but comfortable and remain comfortable and in place throughout the day.  These Dockers fit those requirements perfectly.  I like the weight of the material and the look.  As I've aged and lost some height,  I've had to accept that I'm no longer a 32"" inseam and these pants in this color come in a 31"" inseam.  I only wish the 31"" inseam were available in more colors."
Just a little big in size real nice boot for the price and are comfortable
Comfortable and color perfect dark navy blue.  Bought it in several more colors.
I love this skirt. The color is just what I wanted and love the length of the skirt.  It's perfect for any weather season. I already  have four different colors. Delivery is excellent.
"The person that received this as a gift is happy with the watch.  As Seiko, expected quaility and that was what was received."
it's warm and good but a little large
"All I can say is that I wish they made shoes like this in my size. They feel comfortable inside, and it's easy and fast to put on my daughter's feet. (She kicks a lot, and I mean a lot.) Surprisingly, companies don't seem to make many hard-soled velcro shoes anymore. That, or I'm looking in all the wrong places. It was great that I found these which look as comfortable as they are. My kiddo doesn't seem to mind them and walks in them more than if she was barefoot.

I got the 6-12 month size and it fits my daughter at 9 months old perfectly. Unlike a lot of hard-soled infant shoes I've found, there are actually grips (not just a flat surface) on the sole, so I don't have to worry about her slipping on tile, wood, or linoleum. A nice and definite plus."
I love the rainbow-of-colors look and the fit is good. I bought my usual size 8.5 B width and there's plenty of rm in the toe box. At first wearing they were soo comfortable; but after 4 hrs of shopping my heels started to hurt.  I usually wear New Balance walking shoes which now have an orthodic insole but are not very attractive. I'm going to buy an orthodic insert for these and see if that helps. These come w/2 prs of shoelaces-hot pink and white and look great with blue jeans.
Prefect
"my husband loves it, it was his early father's day present. great quality for the price. arrived on time. he gets several compliments wherever we go."
Super comfy and soft
Got these for basketball and they worked out well
very beautiful and worth the price
These seem very true to size. Time will tell how they hold up but they seem very well made and comfortable.
I gave it to my daughter for her birthday and she had to try it on right away she loves it
My son loves this belt. He is slender but a growing teen and I hope this belt lasts him several years!
"My sister recommended Mario Badescu Drying Lotion, so I decided to give it a try. One very big positive is the price. In my experience, many skin care products are scams that can cost a fortune. 17.00 is a fair price for this product. The lotion (thought it's not really a lotion) contains salicylic acid and chamomile. Most people probably know that salicylic acid is a very common and inexpensive product used to treat acne, which can also reduce redness. Chamomile is also used to reduce redness, so the formula of combining the two seems like a good idea.

The directions are simple. Apply your usual nighttime moisturizer before applying the drying lotion. Make sure you allow your moisturizer to dry thoroughly before applying the drying lotion. Then, dip a qutip in the bottle of drying lotion, and apply it to problem areas on your face. Make sure to buy extra long qutips because regular qutips barely reach the bottom of the bottle. Once you have used about half of the product, you are going to want an extra long qutip.

Now, how effective is this product? I think it is just as effective as something like Proactiv. The drying lotion is not a miracle by any means. Does it work? Yes, it works to some extent. It works to the extent that salicylic acid has always worked. Will you have dramatically clearer skin overnight? No. Will you have clearer skin after a few days? Yes. But this product is not a miracle or a new formulation that we have never seen before, and this product does not prevent acne. Many of the reviews fail to mention that this product is actually intended for use on whiteheads. I rarely have whiteheads, so I mainly used the drying lotion on your average red pimples. So I can say that the product does work on average pimples to an extent, but it's no better than Proactive, Retin-A, or anything else you might have tried. I tried the drying lotion on a few whiteheads, and, again, it's not a miracle worker. It works as effectively as most other products I have tried.

I will buy this product again for two reasons: the price is fair, and I do not want to pay a dermatologist to prescribe me benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid. The dying lotion is a good product, but it's not a miracle. Set your expectations reasonably, and you should be fine."
Super happy. It wears beautifully. Light material perfect under cardigans or suit jackets
"I am planning on upgrading the foot beds shortly, need just a bit much arch support. Great looking and light with great traction."
Very sturdy and stylish. This is the second time I have ordered this brand. I like these because they are quality but for the price I won't lose my mind when I lose the glasses . I can't count how many times I have left them on the golf course or at the table after dinner! 
I love these pants and went on order record to buy some more but it comes up unavailable!  Please make more!!!!
Good boot for grandson
"I stay somewhat adjusted, but does not bother to walk. It has good fabric and good stretch. The next time you order in another color it will be a medium size"
"It's a little on the fitted side so if you're in between sized definitely opt for the larger. I love it though, second Threads 4 Thought I've owned. I wouldn't pay retail ($40 or something?) for these, but at the price they've been going for on Amazon ($10-13) they're a steal."
"Beautiful, warm boots! I live in northern Wisconsin where you need to keep your feet warm just for everyday activities, but I was tired of clunky, ugly footwear. These were the perfect choice. The gray/brown combo goes with everything and I like that they don't have a lot of fluffy fur like so many boots I looked at. The fit is shoe-like, not heavy or clunky, but there's still room for heavy wool socks when needed. I can comfortably tuck in regular or skinny jeans too. I was a little nervous about lace-up boots, but the speed laces at the top make them fairly easy to take on and off. **Update: Still loving these boots after two seasons of wear. I get lots of compliments on them! I live where Uggs are the standard fare for everyday winter wear, but these are unique."
"I ordered this shirt for a ukulele performance at church.  I typically wear an extra large, so that's what I ordered.  The shirt arrived in good order and is well made.  Its a little bigger than XL but since its cotton I expect it to shrink a bit after the first wash or two.  I also was pleasantly surprised to find it was actually made in Hawaii.  I reccomend this to all."
"Awesome fit and size, bright print! Even came with a HAND WRITTEN thank you note. Will purchase more."
"This Wacoal bra is my absolute favorite, wear-all-the-time bra.  I purchased this white one as a replacement to my previous exact same bra because I wore it to death (sadly!).  I desperately wish they had my size in the black, so I could replace that one also.  The bra has lightly padded cups, which is nice because they aren't ridiculously cushy, padded, fake things, but give me a layer of comfort and protection, avoid awkward moments, and help my clothes lay smoothly.  Everything fits nicely, with no pokes or ""too tights"", while also holding my chest up where it should be, not where it wants to be after four breastfeeding children.  Wacoal is definitely a brand worth every penny, especially for hard to find larger sizes, and Amazon pricing makes them more affordable than Macy's, the only other place I can find them (in store).  Highly, highly recommend!"
This watch looks great. Large but not too large and bulky. Very light. My only criticism would be that there is no light as there is in most watches hence the four stars instead of five.
"I wore these out of the box for my 2012 JMT hike. Hiked 220 miles (15-18 miles a day) with about 17-30lbs on my back(depending on how much food and water I had in my pack). I never got any metatarsal bruising . Got maybe 3 minor blisters, compared to my companion who wore light Solomon hikers who got dozens of blisters. They dry pretty quick after getting wet, and have a nice wide toe bed to accommodate for foot swelling. They preformed well, so i gave them 5 stars. My only gripe is that they're so ugly. Wish they made the AT Plus in my size (15), it's much handsomer."
"These are some of the best fashion-forward sneakers out there. If you can't find a color combination (or multiple ones, I have several pairs) that fit your wardrobe, then something is wrong. Super comfortable, and an absolute steal at the price I got them at ($25!). Despite having a little less padding, the Low Pros seem just as comfortable as the regular Jazz. Love these shoes!"
This product is an added accessory to my wardrobe. Can wear different types of shirts with not showing straps!
I got these for my wife and she didn't like the style
"I got another brand at the same time as I got this one only because there was only one in stock, and I wanted two, so I got another brand.  I prefer the fit and feel of this one over the other, but they are both good."
Coverage isn't great in the front...wear panties
"This dress is awesome! The price was great and it was very pretty. I ordered the rose color. I am 5'7"" and weigh around 115. The size small fit perfectly. I think I might order the blue for a different wedding in June."
These fit my size 8 shoe size perfectly. I'm wearing them daily underneath wool socks and the combination keeps my feet warm and dry. Happy.
Love the elastic that molds to your instep and helps to keep it on your foot!  It is elegant looking and very comfortable.  I would order another pair if they still had my size.
"Great costume! Higher quality than others of the same price range. The fabric itself is thin, but the fringe makes up for it. The fringe is around the entire dress too, not just the front like some others. I am usually a size 12, 5' 5"" tall, measurements 42-34-44, and a 36DD and the XL fit perfectly in the body. My only problem was that there was room in the straps, but I planned on cutting them and sewing ribbons at the top for easy removal (this is being used for a burlesque show) so it wasn't a problem at all! After the alteration it is exactly what I wanted at a great price! I will update with photos after this weekend!"
Love this ring very well made
Wish they had more padding in the ball of the foot but overall nice.
"My second one, love the feel of the fabric, very comfortable and easy to wash/dry."
Bought this for my daughter. She loves it. Very soft.
"I love the LOOK of this boot !!! However, the fit leaves a lot to be desired.  As another reviewer pointed out, the loose fit around the ankle doesn't offer any support to hold or keep the shoe on your foot. Be prepared for a fit more like a slide or clog ., I wear 8.5 to 9. I ordered these in 9, but probably could have gone with an 8..  If you're between sizes I would definitely size down.  With that being said, love the look of these enough that it wasn't worth the hassle to exchange."
had one front pocket rather than two
"It's a heavier suede , it's more of a velour perfect for winter,it's true to size !!!!"
"Love the bangle, looks very nice"
"I knew this was going to be dainty when I bought this. Its very thin, and as such, the engraving is a bit hard to read. But I have a big preference for petite rings over chunky ones, so its great for me."
This shirt fitted me very nicely. I enjoyed wearing the shirt.
"Fits perfectly. I just loved this ""Tamiami"" model. It is very fitted in the waist so it gives you a more feminine look. The colors are bright and delicate, and has many cool and useful features for outdoor activities. I use it in the tropics and sun proof material is always a plus."
Everyone is on here bitching about these boots. you get what you pay for. you cant expect to wear these all day and them not fall apart. I wear them with a certain outfit to church and to work. (I have an office job). use your brains and think before you order something. they fit me great and they were comfortable. I wear an 8 and that is what I got. Gots lots of compliments on them. would love to have them in white if I can find them on here.
These shoes are beautiful and I love the little gold emblem on the back. They are comfortable and I've worn them all day several times. They are a basic black pump but the little details make them special
"I ordered a size larger to have a looser fit and it is still a bit too tight but with a jacket is will work for the occasion I needed it for. Great fabric, I intended to order only one and two arrived. A black dress can always come in handy! I will keep both!  Seems I ordered two by error..lol"
Very comfortable....the various colors match several of my scrubs! Good shoe choice.
"EXCELLENT SERVICE, PRICING AND RETURN POLICY.  I PLAN TO DO MOST OF MY SHOPPING ON THIS SITE BEFORE I VENTURE TO OTHER SITES."
My husband loves his new shirt.  It is perfect for southern California chill!!  Dickies really makes nice clothing.
"Arrived very quickly and the crocodile pattern I bought looks nicer than in the pictures.  Have not used them on a trip yet, but they appear to be well made."
"if you are not sure of your size, be sure to remember the avg American size is a normal person enlarged by ~20%  (i guess they got sick of all the Xs in their sizes, so they just planted a new flag)"
I bought this for my grand daughter!! It is a very well constructed bag !! Its very pretty !! Arrived on time !! Its at the monogram shop now getting her initials on the top !! This will be a great Christmas gift for her !!!
"I love them, just want I wanted & needed"
So warm and cozy and they fit perfectly.
I just bought this to wear to a Chinese costume party and for six dollars I think it's great!  Obviously you would not want to wear this every day  but for a dress up adding it's perfect.  Delivered promptly with prime!
"These are perfect! I love the ""infinity edge"" at the leg opening, no band means no sausage leg effect. The waist is high enough to shape but stops at the natural waist so I don't have to pull it all the way up under my bra like most panty hose. The fabric is slick enough that pants do not become hung up or clingy. They pull on nicely, have a nice smoothing effect and are comfortable, not constricting. (I wear 2x pants but ordered the 3x shaper) The nude color is perfect too - completely no-show under white pants. LOVE them."
Pure Awesomeness
Sending to my boyfriend in Afghanistan so he'll have something festive to wear for when they can celebrate Cinco De Mayo from overseas
"Thank goodness I read some reviews before buying these jeans, because the length is shorter than U.S. measurements. My preferred size is W34 L30, I took a gamble and only added 2 sizes more to length. I'm happy I was right. I will say that the waist is a bit loose, but not enough to warrant any adjustments."
i have bought these pants before and i love them. i am short hence the petite. the only  problem i see lately is the quality is not the same. it is made very thin and looks like it will not last as long as ones i have bought before but other than that its good.
I usually wear size 9.5 wide and that's what I ordered. It fits. I bought it for a wedding and my feet started to hurt after about 5 or 6 hours. By that time I was able to change into more comfortable shoes because they already took all of the wedding pics. The other bridesmaids hate these shoes because their feet started hurting during the ceremony at the church.
"I purchased this to transport a formal gown to an event but with all the space it offers, I plan to store several maxi dresses it and hang it in my store room since they are too long for my closet.  Good value for a nice storage option."
Pleased with my purchase.  Comfortable and nice looking for casual or dress.  I purchased a pair years ago and just now needing a new pair.
Comfortable !! So far so good . Stand on feet a lot been very comfortable so far
"They are of good quality, no show through and very comfortable."
"I love the open scroll work on the one side, the stones are all perfectly matched. I LOVE YAZILIND"
Really nice and warm. My daughter loves it
"Great serum for acneic skin, not only it fights with zits, but also works for better appearance overall. It burns a bit because has a menthol in it, but I spray my face with spring water and use less serum. Work great under sunscreen and make up."
"Love this design,style,fit,color. Would have given it 5 stars but Im super sad to say that Im returning it because unfortunately it had a 3 inch rip in the seam in one wrist /arm area and I'm not sewing a brand new item I just spent 50 bucks on."
lovely well balanced charm that will add to any collectors bracelet.  A beautiful classic sure to be treasured for years to come.
"I like that it's gentle enough for diamonds, biodegradable and isn't harsh on fingernails."
Glad i ordered them!
love the color.  love the feel. love the fact it come with eye shields but so did my dog.  husband likes it too
So comfy. Reef is my fave slipper
"Great jeans, fit great"
"these boots go above and beyond my expectations!! I was afraid to order without trying on as I have a somewhat small foot for my height! I am 5'7"" with a 6.5 size foot, my problem is my feet are WIDE, I have a very difficult time finding shoes that accommodate my size and width so I usually end up ordering a size bigger to make up the difference, I got these and they are so comfortable,  I could have gotten these in the right size and they would be perfect. I would say if you have a narrow foot these may be loose, but I would try them anyway. absolutely no regrets purchasing these!!"
Very comfortable socks for running or work.
"This is one of the best back packs I've ever bought. It's extremely sturdy. It doesn't have a lot of pockets, but I can throw all of my stuff in it and go."
I couldn't put my charm on it because if the clasp but otherwise a nice necklace.
Shipping was a bit long but these were exactly what was pictured
Gorgeous...love it.
This watch arrived very quickly and it works perfectly. I'm thinking about ordering more because it's the perfect size and you can attach it to any necklace or even a ribbon.
"Fits and feels good. I am an older male that hates tight fitting hats (or anything), so while I am not really looking so much for style than comfort, this is really a great product."
I bought this along with a bunch of other beads as a Christmas gift for my mom. This one is so cute and is really well made. It doesn't look inexpensive at all.
"Great rave top! Looks good on everyone and fits lots of sizes, from my A cup friend to DD cup friend they both tried it on and it looked really good on them. The color is prettier than in the picture, it's very pink and pretty and shimmery. I've had this over a year and none of the shimmer as come off or dulled. This is one fo my favorite rave tops and I have since bought it in 3 other colors"
Great quality and looks great too!
"fits perfect, loved the sandals, great seller"
I wish the back was close or that the picture or description of the outfit says that the back is wide open
"Exactly what is shown. I like them, 80s theme party"
comfortable but a little narrow for me. I usually wear a d width
"Great jean, i love the wash. It is different and has a rich deep dark blue color.  The jeans fit very comfortably (not tight and not baggy).  The material is soft and durable.  I'm pleased with the purchase."
The pins are fine
Length is a little long down towards the knee. Other than that they seem pretty good.
Beautiful dress Love it!
"Ordered this bra a size up from what I normally wear as a lot of reviews said it ran small. Getting one size up was perfect. It fits just right. The support is great, and it's really comfortable to wear. So convenient and easy to use for breastfeeding. Plus, the little padding makes the girls look great!"
"I purchased this for my niece's 12th Birthday.  This is a great value for sterling silver.  She dances a lot, so I think she'll love it.  Perfect length for young girls, with extension.  This came wrapped really nicely, as well.  The necklace itself came in 2 small ziplock bags, one smaller than the other.  The charms and 1/2 the ""chain"" were in the smaller bag, and then everything was in the larger bag.  I believe this is to keep it from tangling.  The entire thing was then in a blue/turquoise ""velvet"" drawstring pouch, which was, in turn, in a matching, turquoise gift box.  The packaging is also perfect for a teen/tween!  Great product, fast shipping!"
"These boots are a good fit BUT I go up a half size for boots. I'm a true 7 1/2 but I ordered 8. The shaft just fits my calves but I expect they will stretch a little with use as my other Timberlands have, which is good thing. I have average size calves. Plenty of room in the toe box. The insole is not padded, it's pretty firm. I think I might put in a gel insole for more comfort when walking around the city for hours. A good looking, well constructed boot with a nice manageable heel. 4 stars because I'm adding an insole."
"These are my second pair - I also have the taupe color.  I'm a professor and need a sensible shoe that looks good with pants or dresses.  These fit the bill and are super comfortable.  I have big feet (11 W) and I've found these fit true to size and have good support (for a flat).

I was a little late ordering when the fall styles came out - but was so glad to find my size/width in black here on amazon."
"Love Vionic shoes, have several pairs"
Good work quality.
I like this band very much.  To me it does run a bit big but I can work with that.  Good size and great price.
Love this pair. I might have to order another pair in the near future.
"My daughter is 5'4.5"" and 115lbs she normally wears U.S. sizes - a small in long sleeve shirts because her arms are long and she is a size 3L in juniors pants
I bought her a medium in the giraffe onesie pj's and it fits great! It looks just like the one Meghan Trainor is wearing in one of her videos"
Very flattering!  Not too sheer.
"Love the color. A little too ""flip-floppy"".  I had heard such good reviews of Oka-B sandals about how comfortable they are to walk in.  This is more of a beach or pool sandal.  Would not be good for walking long distances."
"Pretty, but I had hoped for a little smaller radius of the metal itself - not the size of the earring."
Great shoe great fit!
"These shoes are so cute. I have hammer toes so finding comfortable wedges can be difficult. These fit well. They do make me over 6 feet tall though, so my boyfriend gives them 2 stars."
Very cute.  Fits nice and is comfy.
"Considering the price point, these are great underwear. The size small fits me perfectly, the legs aren't too tight, and I haven't experienced the fabric riding up in the back or anything.

The fabric is very thin, which is fine by me. I do however, get the sense that these underwear might stretch or lose their shape over time."
We used these all through our trip to HI.  Great product!
"very cute but post bend easily, be careful. for price i would get again. screw backs great so not pulled out."
"These are super cute but not that comfy, but hey, you get what you pay for! They were for a wedding and they did the job, just don't plan on standing in them for many hours!"
Love them want another pair. In a different color
"Grt earrings, got a lot of two small balls, but what I got was a grt find . . ."
I daughter loves the shoes.
"My son absolutely LOVES these sneakers, and I do too!  Very well made and look great!"
Great bag...goes with a lot in my closet! Roomy but not at all bulky. Well made.
Great extra birthday gift.
"my 5 year old loves this, fit him true to size!"
"Excellent boot, wish I had ordered a half size up. No room for a thick sock but on the other hand thick socks haven't been necessary. Overall, I give these boots 4 stars."
My grandson loves them ! He says more comfortable than the converse we usually ourchase.
Sturdy and stable.  I love them.
"I never really wore these boots except just around the house for a little while and they felt good on my feet with right fit for a while, however I thought I would get blisters on my ankles and the soles of my feet started to burn.

For many years, I have been a wearer of Rockport dress and sport shoes but never boots. I don't think these are made for me and my diabetic feet.

I would however, recommend these boots.  They are well made, right sizes, and well, Rockports."
My daughters are required to use these ballet shoes to take classical ballet classes at their dance academy. They are great ballet shoes!
"Absolutely love these shoes! Look great and I get so many compliments. The best part is the comfort. The memory foam sole is like pillows for your feet. It's hard to find a comfortable, yet up to date, stylish heel. . I wear them to work all day without any discomfort. Heel height is perfect. They are very similar to Sofft brand shoes that I have, but not as pricey. The color is a very soft pale gold which is what I was looking for. The only thing I would change, is that I wish they were leather. Other than that, perfect!!! AND they were delivered in 2 days!"
"Great shoe but bit too narrow and having a high instep, they just didn't work of me. Wish they did - they're totally the bomb!."
Loved this scarf
good fit and stability
cool shape kids love them
Had so many compliments!
These fit and look great. Much better looking than standard boxers. No issue with the button fly. Will order again.
"Got these to go w/ the Cinderella costume and as expected they're tight @ the toe b/c they're plastic, but it'll stretch depending on wear."
"I like the combo of the red with the tan/beige at the bottom. Fits as expected, decently comfortable. The one complaint I have is that these are VERY slippery. These seem dangerous to wear during rainy days. I don't know what's going on with the bottom of these shoes, but avoid moisture like the plague."
These are superb! Soft and cute. I have ordered more in solid colors. Love them. need I say more? NO
Light and comfortable.  Good value for price
Comfy but too warm for San Diego winters.  They weren't too hard to slip on in size 11.
So far they are comfortable. I have many problems with my feet. The true test will be when I take a long walk.
Love the fabric and the way it hangs when worn.
This product is great for those dresses that require no bra!!! I'm busty and it worked for what I needed!!
"Hi. It's me again. I consulted with an apparel expert at Adidas, and I told him that I usually wear a jeans size 36 but that I wear medium (32-34) underwear. He suggested I buy the large because it tends to be a bit tight, and he was right. They're comfortable and a good fit, even at a large size.

However, one thing I should point out is that it makes using urinals at public places just a bit more complicated. (Especially when you're wearing jeans.) I had to undo my belt, unzip my zipper, and pull my equipment out. The head had to readjust from being settled in, and some of the stream went to the side. I had to make sure my junk was completely out and pointed the right way before I could get a decent stream. Then, you have to put it back in.

I'm not an athlete by any means, but my recommendation is that you wear these with shorts, so you have more chances to get air up in there. These boxer briefs are very comfortable and do hold your equipment in. However, they'd be just a bit better if they had a fly. That's why I'm only giving it four stars. If I had a chance to buy these again, I'd probably go with a color other than black. Maybe next time."
Nice product but very small and tight. If i inhale too mich the top buttons pop
very cute just too small
Absolutely CUTE.  Would buy more if I had more gals to give them to.
"Perfect for summer! Fit both my 8 and 6 year old like a breeze. This is a light cover up, and better suited for summer than fall."
"They are just precious little earrings.  These little Celtic knot 'star"" earrings are very well made and comfortable to wear."
Sooooo adorable! This was perfect for Christmas Day.
Exellent purchase for the price
Great shirt. I've washed it a couple times and the black has great coloring.
"It's very comfortable, better then a wire bra."
very pretty and what a great price. It's too big but that's my fault. It looks and feels like a much more expensive ring
so far they hold up well- the finish hasn't worn off and the frame is ok for a cheapy- i bought for looks only and polarization and im happyfor a picky person
"not as soft as I was hoping for. It's a bit itchy, but I may just not be a fan of cashmere."
This is a lovely purse and I like it so much; have gotten many comments on it!
Great shoe. Looks even better in person. Very comfortable.
"good quality, works as a nice slip"
"For $8.00 U.S.? Come on! Any leather pouch to keep them is around $10.00 at least...Perfect buy, for small heads, not as cheap looking as I expected according to the reviews (remember you pay $8.00). I just thought I bought a cool design of sunglasses as if I was at a flee market, garage sale, or souvenir store by the beach. I allways looked for this kind of glasses at fancy eyewear stores with no success just because I had a pair that got stolen many years ago, I'm happy now. If someone ever steal this ones, I won't regret it."
Great size and super cute!
Great but small I bout it to my wife and got 325
It was a gift. Looked nice but the packaging was not very good.
Very nice fit love the feel will definitely buy more.
"Love these.  Bought one for myself and gave the other to a friend.  She really liked it as well.  Good quality and great colors.  Shipped quickly, packed well.  Would buy again."
A bit small than expected.
"Gorgeous shirt. Highlights male muscle tone, nit quite as nice as Affliction, but for the price well worth it to add to your t-shirt collection."
"OMG ..I purchased this VIRGIN ONLY Women's Pencil skirt in Olvive and let me say it is so much cuter in person. The skirt is made of a somewhat thick material which was good \, but not too thick were you would only wear in the winter. I absolutely love the length, it's added sexy without trying. This was a grea buy and so much so I bought another skirt from them. I am very pleased with both skirts I purchased from Virgin Only. I purchased this product at a discount for my unbiased opinion, that being said I already have the product so there is no need for me to mislead you in your purchasing. Happy shopping!!"
"Got this to replace my wedding ring and band that I accidentally broke while working on our Ford Expedition together. I wanted something lightweight that wouldn't break, as well as something smooth that would never scratch me or our young children.

It shipped quickly, and looks pretty, but it's very thick, and a little bit loose on my finger. If it was a 4 1/2 instead of a 5 and half as thick I might like it more. We got a great deal on the price, but I don't know if I'll be able to wear it 24/7 like I would like to."
Good hot weather shirt for reenacting
"My husband has thrown out all other boxers in his underwear drawer in favor of these. I've had to go back and buy several more packs. They are lightweight, wash well, hold up to workouts and daily living."
"I love these, although they are a little roomy.  Still very comfy and look stylish."
The fabric on these boots is insanely soft! They are beyond comfortable as well! I was able to wear these for a full 8 hour shift the first time I wore them! Great quality!
"My LO has a big booty made bigger by wool diapers, and this her fits her perfectly. She never noticed it was on. She wore this as a 10 week old to a wedding, and recently as a 3 1/2 mo old to her baptism. Still has room to grow, but never seemed absurdly large to me. Great quality and looks perfect under formal dresses, not too flashy."
7.5 or 8 is my usual size. These fit perfectly.  Looking forward to wearing them in the next snow storm!
Both fit and quality exceeded expectations.
"LOVE these shoes. They are cute and comfortable with enough lift to be sexy. The color is awesome too. The insides are nicely cushioned also. A+++++ Would buy again. Will probably buy in another color, actually."
"This is a great top, it fit perfect."
i bought this because we would have all day trips with a lot of walking and my normal purse starts to get really heavy after a while. this helped me downsize to just the essentials and the color is great!
Wow! Great shooes!
"Flexible, comfortable, non-slippery, non-marking. I am using them for training at home or in the gym. They are supper light. I think it would be possible to wear them without  socks since they are build that way although I don't see/feel anything wrong wearing low cut ones."
The color is way off of the actually leggings you receive. The actually color is cartoonish royal blue
"A gift for a friend, and he loves them!"
Comfortable. Can wear them all day and do not hurt my feet! Great price for these!
My grandbaby doesn't leave home without it!
Good piece. Glad I bought it.
This is a delicate and beautiful necklace. It is perfect and stylish. Very delicate and it so light weight you don't realize you are wearing it.
"I first saw these shoes in a store and was surprised to like them as much as I did. The picture does not show the true beauty of the irridescent color or the gold metallic heel. If you're on the fence, try them in person just to see! As for the fit, I did go a 1/2 size up from my normal shoe size (purchased a 9 normally wear a 8.5) because the strap across the toe felt too tight in the 8.5. It was well worth it though because I am in love with this shoe!"
"I usually wear a 9, but a 9.5 in this boot was perfect for me. I love these boots. I've had no moisture leak in, the fur goes all the way down into the boot and is so comfy and soft. They have held up for two seasons now and look brand new. The material does not stain at all. I love these boots. I will definitely be getting another pair when mine finally wear out."
I was a little skeptical about this purchase because it was so quiet that we thought it was  broken. It works perfectly but you have to let it run for a full 15 min before using it so it can break in the heating element properly. It had a slight smell when we first used it but nothing since then. It works well and is very quiet
sexy without being slutty.  Perfect
I like the fact they do not fall down.
"For the price, this was a great shirt for a star trek event I went to.  For the price, this was a great shirt for a star trek event I went to."
I read the reviews and am very small but wanted this to not only fit but wanted it long like on the model so I ordered a large and it's perfect. The sleeves are long and it goes almost to my knees. I've got long legs so I love the way it's still form fitting and it's long. Don't be afraid to order a couple sizes up cuz it hugs the body so it's more about length. Will recommend this to friends and family.
"Awesome sweater! It is fine, but personally, I would prefer it if sweater wasn't made in China."
Gift - Size 8 - she loved it.
His backpack is beyond adorable and very functional with many different compartments. Definitely well worth the money
I love these because they are very thin for the summer but the quality wasn't  lacking
"Seem a little small for an adult!  But, I love this style, so I guess I will make due!  Hopefully, they will stretch with use!"
They are really nice shades but they are better suited for a woman unless you are a man with a very narrow face. They are tight on my face.
good basic and comfortable
I wish they made these shirts in more colors because I would buy even more great fit for work and looks great.
I just received these as a gift from someone special they fit and look great and you cant find these colors at your local Megamart store.
"so glad i read the reviews. i usually wear a small and this runs too small, so i got a 3 xl and it fit like a medium size. i could have odered a 2 xl  and it fit snug but i love the fit with 3 xl as there is some room for shrinkage when i wash it. Really great shirt."
I've had this bag for a couple of months and is working out fine so far. I got tired of replacing my mobile offices and wanted something that would last a long time. I think this is going to do the trick.
"Bought this as part of a Walter White halloween costume. Perfect. Would be good for a J. Robert Oppenheimer costume too - but a tad more obscure, probably."
My father in law loves them !! He said they were the best he's had
My daughter loves this gown! Pretty looking and good quality material she will wear it everyday if she could. Have received many washes and still looks almost as new.
"This wallet is exactly what I was hoping it would be. Large enough to fit all my cards and my checkbook, without being too bulky. The compartments for bills and coins work great as well. And I love that I can just carry it with the wrist strap if I don't feel like taking my whole  purse. Seems to be well constructed so far and I haven't had any trouble with the closures. Great wallet for any Harry Potter fan!"
"I like it. The only difference is it doesn't come past my backside like I thought it would. It's shorter in the back than what's depicted. Otherwise, it's good. I'll still wear it."
"Love em, but they're just too wide. Not for slim footed folks."
really tight but maybe after wear some they will stretch out
"Nice bikini panties, comfy,no muffin top thingy, but disappointed in the colors ,not as pictured"
"This top is comfortable and cute.  I am a medium in most other tops, but a large in Lucky, and this top was no different. It fits true to the Lucky sizing. I've ordered a bunch of other tops because they are perfect with jeans or shorts."
"Fits well, but quality doesn't seems to be very good, but worth of the pay."
"This is my 3rd pair, they are so comfortable right out of the box. I do wish they had a pertective toe cap though."
I love these boots more than I expected to. Great quality and fit. Definitely worth the purchase.
I purchased this for my granddaughter she is she just turned one and this fit her with a little room for warmer clothes on the inside it looks so cute on and is well made 
"I WORKED AT THE AIRPORT AND WAS ON MY FEET RUNNING AROUND FROM 8-10 HOURS A DAY.  MY FEET NEVER HURT, NEVER GOT SWOLLEN AND I NEVER GOT IN TROUBLE CAUSE THEY LOOK CUTE LIKE SHOES NOT SNEAKERS.  ABSOLUTELY GREAT SHOE"
"OMG...Love it,thanks!!!"
"I think it will be several weeks before the boots are fully adapted to my feet.  I really like the boots and think they will be fine after they break in and are formed to my feet.  The straps and buckles of these boots require the leather to soften by constant flexing.  I previously wore Herman tanker boots.  These are better boots, but will require much more breaking in time."
First of all the shop owner is so lovely I got the sweetest emails from them and it made me really excited to get the bracelets and when I did I was not disappointed. They are stunning and made extremely well. My friend and I haven't taken them off since they arrived they made the perfect gift. I will be buying from this shop again.
i like it. fits a little small. i wear a size 14 and the xl just fit. i would order a size up.
"Great quality and it looks great. Unfortunately it was a little small for me, but Im hoping it will fit better once I lose some weight! Perfect for Comic Con!"
This purse is great!  Very pretty colors and nice style.  I carry it everyday!  I always get compliments on it from people of all ages (both men and women).  Will eventually buy in another color so I have variety.
Beautiful quality and color. It is very warm and confortable. It's better that you buy one or two sizes more.
"I love this bag! I've had a number of them over the years. They sturdy but light, and look good."
Very good looking and feeling.
A little large and not the most comfortable. But they work for just working on the farm.
"I bought these shoes for a trip to Europe I am taking and wanted a comfortable shoe.  Got them early and decided to try them out during my Zumba class.  I absolutley love them. They are soo comfortable. I have a wide foot and normally after an hour of juming up and down my feet hurt.  No soar feet. I have worn them walking, shopping, and exercising.  I am now a Merrell fan, will never buy anything else.  And they are very cute to top it off.  So you can be comfortable and look fashionable at the same time.  :)"
Good looking watch. It appears to be much more expensive than actual cost. The face is a good size and easy enough to read. the band is a good quality leather and is comfortable. If this last as long as my other Casios it will certainly be a good value.
"soft, flowy material, waistband fits perfectly at the waist.. think it should look nice paired up with a plain top. falls a bit above ankles on 5""5."
I am extremely pleased! The fit was perfect. It arrived on time. The price was great! Well worth it! 
Fine ando i loved
"I usually wear a medium in other shirts from big box stores so I ordered a large since other reviews said these can run small. Would probably order the X L next time.  They are too tight / body hugging.  Material feels good.  Good value for the money, I just wish they weren't so tight. They run more like Juniors sizing than women's / misses sizing."
"I bought this and I haven't died yet.  I must be invincible.  This is a very high quality product for the price and it arrived amazingly fast.  The detail is stunning, and if you're at all into the spiritual side of this it's really nice to have.  I don't take this kind of thing very seriously, but if nothing else the looks alone make this worth having.  A part of me does really respect the symbolism behind this and the history of it, yet another part of me just wears it because I just feel comfortable with it and it's become part of my daily routine.  Since I started wearing it, I have died exactly 0 times.  Clearly it's working."
"I ordered tan since it was the lightest color they had, other than white.  The tan was WAY too dark for the intended shoes.  Not worth the return shipping cost.  I will have to continue looking elsewhere for very thin dress shoelaces in beige or cream.  If anyone has any sources, I will be very happy to learn about them!

Update:  The company owner contacted me to see what he could do to make me happier.  He refunded my original purchase and sent me another set, free.  These new laces work beautifully!  They are not waxed, which is the style I prefer.  They are the right color for my shoes.  I was very impressed with the customer service.  They care that their customers are happy and are willing to go the extra mile for them!"
"Beautiful, well made bracelet. Very sentimental message."
"These are great for those of us who do not have the ""usual"" build. My hip and bottom are one size and my waist another size. If they fit my waist, the pants sag. If I my pants to fit my bottom, the waist is to small. This is just the way I am built. With just an extra inch with these extender, I can get pants that look good on me and are comfortable. This is not a 'just gained weight' thing. My BMI is 22 and has been that for years. These are worth a try for those that have the same problem as me."
"This jacket arrived quickly and is seriously comfortable.  It is form-fitting, but not too snug.  It looks great.  Given some of the reviews, I thought it might be a little small, but a large fits me great.  My first impression is highly favorable.  If this thing is durable, Grin&Bear just got themselves a life-long customer.  I'll update my review after I've worn it a round a bit.

Update:  After washing a few times the fabric relaxes a tiny bit.  Still fits extremely nicely and is comfortable.  The cuffs lose elasticity VERY quickly but that's probably my fault for wearing them around my elbows.  Still a 5 star jacket, I'll be buying clothes from this company until I get too fat to wear their stuff.  Their shirts are great too."
"Nice quality, and big enough for travel!"
Bought for my dad and he loves them!! Great quality and fit great.
"I was a bit skeptical honestly but they came in super fast. I got the dark blue, they are incredibly soft, the front is a bit low on me but I'm rather short so I can understand, great detailing and i like the  stretchy waistband!"
"If you are on your feet all day, this shoe is for you."
Lovely looking shoe; my husband complimented them as well.  I wouldn't say comfortable but I'm not comfortable in heels but will wear them to complete the look:) I'd say order to your true size. I went 1/2 size larger and would've been better off with 6.5 which is my normal shoe size. I have an average size width and typically dress sandals feel narrow on me and that's why I went with 1/2 size up. Wasn't the case for this sandal. Great shoe overall and very pretty!
I love this wallet. I am so excited!
I tried the bold low rise trunks and really liked the material but they ran a little small. I'm sure these will too but doesn't matter as much with briefs. Most comfortable of all CK makes.
I like these shoestrings good quality very pleased would order again
I wear a ladies size 7 1/2 or 8 and I ordered these in a youth size 6.  They fit perfectly and were much more reasonably priced than the adult size.
Nice shoes. Comfortable. Mom likes them.
"Nneds belt, but fits ok"
"I am only 23 but have been suffering in my knees and hips from old athletic injuries and post pregnancy woes. After a lot of research I found that this specific shoe was good for bad knees. After 2 weeks of daily 3 mile walks I would have to agree! Great price for the shoe, just remember it is narrow not medium."
I can't believe something this small can hold so much.  I do most of my traveling on train and this will be fantastic.
this is a great wallet. got a good amazon price and it's exactly what i was looking for.
great dress for the money.  Fits well and can be casual or dressed up.
"There are few things that work perfectly every time, and this device has done a great job with my wet boots and shoes for several years.

The dryer is rated for 36 Watts and circulates warm air by convection, so there no noise and little to wear out. A 30 year warranty!

No on/off switch, but my extension cord has one.

Low, gradual heat, but overnight has always worked for me.

I put my gloves on top of the boots, and they dried pretty well -- there is an attachment for about ten bucks, but I was too cheap to buy it.

I also saw a neat version the might appeal to a DIYer: ""Make your own with PVC pipe and two small light bulbs (not LED or CFL.) Incandescent light bulbs put out most of their energy, over 90% in fact, as heat. They are actually cheap electric heaters that happen to produce a bit of light too. If you want to make the bulbs last longer or reduce the heat output, wire the bulbs in parallel, not series."" If this one didn't work so well, I might give that a go.

I wear them on my motorcycle and love them. well built  and dark  shipping was fast all good for the price 5 stars..
My daughter loves these.  They keep her really warm and dry. She loves how easy they are to put on too.
Adorable...
Very cute and light. Perfect for wearing on my pinkie.
"Hubby drives a semi, and these are perfect for his job!"
"These are really really nice. I'm getting to the point wear anything above a flat is a pain, so how nice to find a graceful-wedge in a Teva! I marked that I could wear these ""all day"" but honestly, I've only done so for 2-3 hours. I changed ONLY to be able to do other stuff, not cuz the sandals were getting uncomfortable. I have no doubt I will wear them all day when I take them on vacation this summer. (p.s. They are a perfect compliment to the Fabric-Store's 100% linen fabric ""IL019"" in the color called ""Mix Natural."")"
"Comfy, with a supportive sole and leather lining so essential when feet sweat in hot weather.  Wonderful alternative to sandals when you want a dressier look with skirts and denims."
Absolutely beautiful cross! Had to put a new chain on it to match the beautiful cross! Recommend this cross to anybody! Please purchase it is beautiful!
"I generally wear an 11.5 in the widest width I can get. As I've gotten older, I suffer from edema in my feet so I typically buy larger sizes to accomodate the swelling. These work well, but due to my own physical issues, I only wear them for a few hours.  That's not to say that they won't work well for others that don't have the same problems. They are comfortable. I'm happy with them."
Beautiful vibrant white.  Gift to brother in law.
Love these kicks!!!
Fit nicely and complimented my outfit ever so perfect!
"I love Timberland for their quality and comfort. These are perfect! Great tone for my skin, feminine but not delicate and comfortable enough for all day."
"Stunning, absolutely gorgeous piece of jewelry. It looks exactly as pictured and I continue to get compliments when wearing it."
"It's soft, warm, and fits great!  Thanks for the prompt shipping, too!"
What a nice flattering option to shorts! Quality and fit is good. Size is as it says which is a huge plus these days! Material is durable. Have not washed yet but it's not flimsy in construction that I can see. I bought them for golf originally but I've already ordered more as it's my new throw on gear for summer. Great price too! Thanks for making them true to size!!
"This was much nicer than expected. I expected one of those generic thongs that others sell as gaffs, but this is a much nicer made for purpose item that seems to do a very nice job while remaining comfortably in place."
These shoes are great! They are comfortable and they come in narrow so they fit very well. So hard to find narrow shoes. These are stylish with a great fit.
"I love these earrings. I always get asked about them. They go with just about anything; can be worn with casual and more dressy outfits. They are well made, not cheap and flimsy. They are a little heavier than I expected so my piercing holes tend to get that droop hole going after a while, but I wear them often."
"This is my third CowCow dress. This one isn't as nice as my other two. The white flowers on a size 3X are somewhat see-through. The dress is a bit big in the armpit area, and tends to bulge out a bit. I will probably put a dart or two in it. Overall, comfy, stretchy and looks nice."
"Love it, but they run a little big with no side support so I ordered a medium and it is just right."
The quality is amazing (they dry super fast) and the material repels water. The design is good and I got them on sale for $25.00
Very pleased with the purchase.  The fabric is softer than most tulle crinolines and the edges are well done.
"Maybe not as fancy as the more expensive ""active"" underwear but not as pricey either. I like them just as much as my Duluth Trading ""Buck Naked"" boxer briefs."
For a baby I felt these fit the best compared to any other brand.
They are cute and simple.
"These socks are great.  They fit perfectly and stay put while I am at pilates class.
Would highly recommend."
Very warm and fashionable for an easy outdoor look
"I love these and i love naot shoes !! i love the gun metal silver color too, as it is winter here I have only tried on, they fit perfectly and I cannot wait to wear them !"
Nice cheap boots. Can't beat that!
"Comfortable. I thought they would be too hot, but they are rather breathable. Did not have to constantly pull up or readjust. Surprised me how comfortable they are. Cute patterns...only I recommend sizing up!"
Fits as expected and good quality. Arrived promptly
"Wonderfully soft, flattering cut, lots of potential.. be warned: this is a lace sheath meant to be worn over a chemise or tank dress.. i say this has lots of potential because i can see using this as a sexy, around the house dress with a nice pair of boy shorts and bra underneath..

i didn't expect it to be see-through, but i am still pleased with the order.. the material is very soft, which has a lot to do with my satisfaction..

oh, in case this helps: i am 38DD/E with a bit of a tummy; about 160 and 5'5"".. i ordered an extra large and it fits perfect on top.. it does have a tie, so you could loosen or tighten, but if i ordered a size down it would have been a tight fit.. the material is stretchy, too.."
"I'll say this is one of the better sports bras that I have bought, but not by much.  If I was to do it over again, I would look for a cheaper alternative simply because this one was so expensive.  I think you could find something of similar quality for a better price.

I think part of my disappointment was that so many reviewers mentioned how there was no bounce at all when they wore this bra, even for larger chested gals.  I did not find this to be the case at all (maybe they were doing lower impact exercise?), but then again, I found ""no bounce"" to be hard claim to believe in the first place.

Was it all I had hoped it would be?  No.  But did it cut down on at least some bounce compared to the standard ""pull over your head"" sports bra?  Yes."
"Great product. Very comfortable to wear. My only complaint is with the internal mesh pockets. It is very difficult to insert items as the corners get stuck in the mesh. It would be much better if the pockets were made of a thin sheet of material, allowing items like passports to be slid in easily. Using the RFID blocking sleeves makes the problem even worse."
Thick made nice
"Nice, light, very smooth material. Waiste doesn't curl up. Bought XL for my 38"" waist"
I love this watch it's awesome and doesn't need much to function. I like knowing its solar and I am doing my part to be green.
"I purchased this watch as a gift, need it in one week time. It arrived on time, great watch, price, an d in general great deal. Recommended for personal use and as a gift"
works very well
Attractive necklace.
Love this wallet. This is my second one.
Perfect tie for my son.
Hi i like it it is warm thanks.
Purchased for my boyfriend. He really likes the shirt and the material but he wishes it was a little longer.
"I have several pairs of crocs and always wear a size 10. But for some reason the right foot of this pair is Snug across the straps going across the top of my foot. The shoes over all are attractive, it's feels stable to wear, and the buckle system is unique and easy to use. Crocs always have that lovely cushy sole for your foot to rest on and is very comfortable.  My only complaint is the straps are tight on 1 foot."
"A light, lovely and luxurious pair of silver earrings which add to the finishing touch of my daily wardrobe wear."
"Not quite as bright as shown in the photo, but beautiful warmer bright peach, like the blush on a peach! Love the lighter weight material for warm months and the crinkle texture. Nice length.
I have 3 colors in all."
Love these shoes.  The gold medallion is not metal but actually embossed into the rubber strap so no rubbing or stiffness.
"12 are usually a little too big on me.  If anyone ever sold an 11 1/2 that would be my size.  These 12s fit perfectly.
I love these shoes, but they do get a little sweaty if you wear them all day and there is no arch support.  Still giving them 5 stars because they are so easy to slide on and off, great traction on the soles, and a great fit as long as you can order up a half size."
"I love these sneakers. They are comfortable and have pretty good cushions...unlike my Converse. I love my converse, but I did need to had an insert for arch support. I get lots of compliments on them. I wear them on Casual Friday's at work with a pair of skinny jeans, a white Tshirt, biker jacket and a Pearl and Chain Choker...Tough girl chic."
The purse came on time and was awesome.  There was nothing wrong with it or any part of the order.  Very satisfied
Super sexy and very comfortable.
"In the first shipment, one of the boots was defective.  I promptly received a replacement pair and they are great.  I ordered a 1/2 size up for extra room for socks.  I live in the mountains, and it stays cold and snowy for a long time.  These boots work perfectly and they are very comfortable."
"I received the ring quickly and it looks like the picture. I purchased a size 9 that I wear on my middle figure and its true to size. I wanted a small cubic zirconia to wear with all my bracelets and watch, the stone looks real. Im going to purchase a again for my daughter."
"Different clasp , but chain is good , solved the problem."
Perfect shirts and easily cleaned.  I only wish they were a tad bit longer.  They are great quality though and I will no doubt buy more colors
Great fit & a nice thickness. I swear my boy rubs his socks through a mud puddle somewhere before throwing them in the hamper but these have done well at coming clean in the wash. These are great and so is the price.
They will be perfect for a small child very cute around 8 to 12
These boots are sickening.
Ive been wanting an Hawaiian shirt like this for a while. What sets it apart is that it has a front placket that buttons up to the neck which gives it a slight formal look. Its made out of a nice soft but crisp cotton and the design has a slight retro appearance. Runs roomy like most resort shirts but not overly so I don't recommend straying far from your usual size. At $18 this is a lot of shirt for the money tho I don't really care for the other designs offered.
This is so beautiful. I bought this for my mother for Christmas. I am so sure she will love it.
This is such a pretty dress. I love it. I am 5'3 and 140 pounds. The medium fit great and I got a lot of compliments. I wish it came in more prints so I could buy more.
"Good product,fit perfectly"
So glad that this model is available again. I realize some people can't wear them but I love them. Very comfortable and help me keep my posture as they tip me towards my toes and I'm usually a heel to toe walker.
"nice stretchy but firm material. flattering fit, Im a size 18, ordered the 2x and its true to size"
"Daughter- in-law loved it, very soft"
a gift for grand daughter
"I probably bought too large a size but they came up way higher than pictured. The photo was just where I wanted them.
But bought them mainly for travel and they are light weight and from the material assume they will dry fairly quickly after hand washing. So good for me. Just not perfect."
"The shirt's color appears close to my monitor representation.  The tag reads 100% cotton, but it feels a tad ""stiff,"" maybe it will soften with a wash.  I expected a more ""fitted"" cut, but the shirt is leaning to boxy, which is fine for my ""senior"" relaxing needs. All in all, I am pleased with my purchase. It looks great with my shorts, skinny jeans. A little tropics with my northeast summer!"
"While I ordered this light pink shoe I received a darker pink shoe in a different style.  I was disappointed as they were supposed to match our daughter's Easter dress, but it was a surprise gift, and she absolutely loves them.  These are very well made, and as we have 3 girls and I expect them to last.  Bought my other daughter some purple ones at the same time and received the correct item."
I like long shorts and these fit nice
"Very light and of good quality, added benefit of being waterproof. They were a gift and the recipient liked them very much."
Very nice hat. My son likes the cool design which made him more likely to wear it.
"To be honest, I didn't buy these to use as water shoes. I saw the toe cap and thought they might be an adequate alternative to Keens. I usually wear a 7 1/2 and have Hobbit feet: wide flat feet with short stubby toes. I got these in a size 8. They have no arch support since they are water shoes, but they are extremely comfortable since I have low arches. My toes can spread though they are a bit long for me. My only qualm, which is purely aesthetic, is that I don't really care for the white stitching."
"Bought for my daughter's dance classes. Horrible trying to find plain white shoes, but these are perfect! A great buy."
good quality outdoor shoes
Everything is great with it so far!
Made great! Perfect for work. My job requires a clear bag.
"I've grown into a huge fan of saxx underwear recently. These in particular fit just right in the waist but are just slightly loose in the thighs. I am 5'5"" 150 with 23"" thighs and a 29-30"" waist.the material is super comfortable and feel like it will last. I love the pouch that saxx has. Every underwear company needs to adopt this!"
I love wearing this hat.  It fits perfectly and looks great
"I absolutely love them! They are super easy to use and to remove, I admit I was a little worried because of some of the reviews, but I had no problem at all. I just did what some recommended, before placing them in my ears, I became familiar with the mecanism. My earrings feel very safe, and I have tried them with different earrings and they work great. I am definitely going to buy more for me and for mi daughter."
Its great best product its worth more than hundred dollars I loved its stylish looks great sunglasses.
"Absolutely gorgeous,  this is a beautiful watch. More than I expected it to be."
"I would say that this is definitely one of the better watch bands that I have purchased. That being said, it still isn't perfect - the clasp feels fairly cheap. In addition, the locking top part of the clasp does not sit flush...slightly annoying, but I've learned to deal with it.

However, the PU material does feel extremely comfortable. After using metal and leather bands in the past, switching to this band has made the watch feel a lot more natural on my wrist."
"These are a great pair of boots for the price. I ordered the gray leather look boots in a size 8.5, which is my normal size although sometimes it fluctuates with different brands. Upon opening the box I was impressed that these have a really nice color and texture to them, they look like they were more expensive boots. They fit my feet pretty well, and should be decently comfortable to wear. They felt a little narrow at the toe but I have kinda wide feet so that wasn't surprising. They might be uncomfortable for long periods of wear but I probably won't find out until fall/winter (it's 110 degrees where I live right now). I also have short legs so the boots come all the way up to my knee, the calf area is a tad wide but overall they fit pretty well considering I ordered them online. They look cute with my skinny jeans and I will definitely be wearing them come winter. The pictures that other people have uploaded are very accurate to how they look on me, they hit right below the knee and have a nice slouchy look.

Other people mentioned that they were really thin, but I didn't really notice that. I mean, ordering boots online for less than $50 what do you really expect? These are not heavy duty boots, they are just cute and fashionable. I always wear thick socks under my boots in the winter to keep my feet warm, as these boots are not lined heavily enough for warmth. Overall I am very happy with these boots, I like the style and the color, and the material is nice. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I still paid for the product and will wear them, I just received a promotional price in order to review them."
"I was looking for a light jacket for the fall/spring weather.. this jacket its perfect, it is also flattering. The color is perfect and it arrive super fast"
enjoying wearing this one.
"For this price point, you cannot go wrong.  I needed a simple analog watch for everyday wear but with my new job needing me to dress a little more professionally than I have had to in the past I thought that I would go for a watch with a more fashionable look to it.  After looking at all the Fossil and Citizen watches that met what I was looking for I noticed this Timex.  It had the same look to it, but was a heck of a lot less expensive so I figured that I would give it a try.

I was really impressed when it arrived, as it has very sleek styling and the satin metallic black finish looks just as fancy as the watches going for upwards of $200.  My wife has mentioned on several occasions that it looks great and we even stopped at the watch counter in Macy's to compare it to the more expensive watches, and it fits right in with them easily.

At first I thought that there was something wrong with the date marker as it didn't move ahead after midnight, but then after playing with it I realized that I needed for ""forward"" the watch through a full 24 hour cycle so that it would ""catch"" on the date dial moving the number up at midnight.  Once I did that, it has worked like a champ for two months now without a problem."
"This jacket looks amazing, is waterproof, and works great in the winter. It's a LITTLE heavy. I'd recommend it for temperatures between 35 - 60 Fahrenheit. I must say, it's not the most comfortable jacket ever. I guess I was expecting a little 'softer'."
My wife thinks I'm a king! Beautiful color and decent cut. 90% less cost than anything here at a store.
"Nice purse, doesn't hold much, but great for the wedding."
"Thswi bracelet is so cute and has held up very well. I have worn it swimming, on the beach and in the ocean and it  still looks new. get this and not the gold tone."
"Arrived as expected, they are nice for the price, would order again"
They're soft and comfortable. No complaints. My daughter likes them.
"I love this ring- I'm not a big ring wearer unless it's my engagement ring, but now I wear this all the time! I had planned on using this ring as a replacement for my engagement/wedding ring when I travel, but now I wear it all the time on the other hand! Its comfortable, and beautiful, and I get a lot of compliments."
nice shirt and nice fit
Bought them for my mom. She loves them. I have two pairs of my own.
Love these gloves.... the perfect touch for the outfit!
"this coat is a beauty. it""s a very lightweight cashmere like wool with great lines to it.
perfect for the pretty mild winters we have in the south, but would be great for fall and spring up north.
it""s well made and a great price for such a beautiful coat."
"Love this cape.  Very lightweight, but well made.  Cute, comfortable costume for Halloween."
Quite nice. Real fossil. Very lightweight. Comfortable to wear. Nice shine.
The size chart is off.  Runs bigger than measurements noted in chart.  Otherwise beautiful.
"Light weight, fits under seats and qualifies as a personal item. This is well made and sturdy. We are enjoying them for travel."
I like the magnification and that the entire lens is 3.00.  In the past I often wished that when I was working on something up close and had to look up instead of down that my bifocals could be used upside down.  Lol.  Now close up work from a different orientation is possible since the entire lens is magnified.  The glasses fit comfortably and were an excellent price.
"could be a bit bigger, but handles a standard size western hat ok; overall, very nice for the price"
Sons favorite. XXL with big rear weighing 240 lbs.
They are comfortable. Cotton is soft. Waistband stays up without feeling too tight. Wear them under any pants and to sleep in. Will buy again.
"I'm a size 9 pants and these were great, I was a little cautious but they're awesome and they definatly could even be a little big on me. Great length and I'm 5,7"
"Great value, great warmth, great feel on and overall excellent product."
They fit well but wasn't the colors I ordered but its ok
"I don't think you can go wrong with Chucks....they have been around for years, and my 13 year old asked for her first pair for Christmas. Found these on Amazon and struggled a bit with sizing. She has big feet for her age, wears a 8.5 womens. I ordered a 6.5 womens thanks to a friend at work that owns many Chucks....they actually are a bit too big, but I think we will keep them, They are very narrow and I think she will get use to the fit. They are well made and have good price. Prompt delivery too :-)"
It's the perfect fit for my toddlers  they love elmo so it didn't disappoint. Perfect for preschoolers! I recommend this product!
"I read other reviews and I was scared because I thought I would not be perfect but I stay and not tight! is a size M and I feel comfortable with it, it is also true to the photo image."
Nice  over sized sweater... just how i like.  Nkt snug....real roomy. And also it still holds its shape and ive already  washed it 3x
I just purchased the black blue outfit in the small and I am extremely happy with my purchase. I weigh a hundred and four I am 5 foot 2 inches and it fit me extremely well the quality of the product is absolutely fantastic I am going to order more of the colors and I would recommend this outfit to anybody looking for a good quality velour outfit. Like I said I ordered the small the pants fit me just perfect the top fit me just perfect. I am very happy with this purchase on Amazon the color I ordered was black.
"These shoes was shown to me by my boyfriend, so I surprised him with them and he love the fit on his feet. They look great with jens or khakis. Thanks"
Perfect to wear with my trousers.
Warm and stylish.  Slightly small so it creeps up around the ears. Goes with every style and stays dry in snow and rain...cool look.
Of course I love it!
Like the shorts
it's really soft material. very nice.
Wife loved it! It was true to size. She wears an size 8 and ordered a medium. Looked really cute on her for our Cruise. Absolutely would buy again
Great boots but not a 5...I am a  size 9 and I got a Large 9.5 to11 and they are too small to fit over my shoes. So am using an old pair of slippers and that works great.
Thick and warm scarf; such versatility.
Very comfortable shoes I expect to be wearing while standing in the long lines at the VA.
These shoes are perfect and sexy.  I will buy in another color.
"I can't decide if these are cute and spunky or old lady shoes!  I find them them totally fun, and I know I'll slide into them often once it finally gets warm here."
"These fit awesome and are super comfy, but they're more like jeggings than jeans"
"I actually haven't tried on or wore this dress yet, but I'm excited at the prospect! Super sexy! I plan on wearing it to a club. Good price."
I'm wearing it now!  I love it.  Pretty and so light weight.  A packkable piece for sure.
Just as pictures and described
Nice Navy top.  Very lightweight lighter color may be a bit see thru.  Comfortable.
"So far I like it a lot but rating it a 4 since it is a bit smaller than I expected. It holds a lot but a little snug. I was looking for something I can carry a small notebook, iPad, phone and kindle with some pens, chargers, headphones and a small bag with feminine products, lipstick, IB, powder and a small travel brush. All these items fit but I can't zip it up. My sunglasses case made it difficult to get in so I had to just keep them in the car which is disappointing since I usually need them when I am also not in the car. I love the side pocket on the side of the purse not front. My iPhone 7 plus fits perfect in it. I have a mophie charging case that makes the iPhone bigger and bulkier and it fits in nice. Overall I like it and will keep it but its not my favorite for functionality but a favorite on look."
Fits well but the nose opening seems to not line up quite right. My son likes it but the mask part is just hard to get on just right.
"Had to return these for a larger waist size. My fault, I was going by the size of levis 505's which I had recently ordered. The 505's
I had discovered require ordering a size smaller in the waist. These have 7 belt loops versus 5 for the 505's. I prefer these."
"I have used these pants all over the world. Great product. Light, dry quickly, pack easily. I will be buying more."
"I have other colors and love them, so comfortable."
"Seem very good quality, arrived on time, I like it."
"Nice shirt, good quality. I liked the collar. My daughter is a size 12 and it fit perfectly."
I'm so excited that the shirt came looking the way I wanted it to. I was worried because when I was sizing the image it said if it was too large it could come out looking fuzzy but thankfully it came out clearly. It got here when it said it would & it fit great.
VERY comfortable and they look great with slacks
Works well. Not visible in the dark. Looks nice. I have had compliments on it.
I love my cute little bag! Perfect
I have these sandals in nearly every color-great fit & support.
Beautiful shoe they are alittle wide for my narrow foot but love the color and feel
"Love! I'm used to only wearing minimizers, to be honest. But unfortunately Olga discontinued my favorite one and I hated the look of the available ones and ordering another brand only ended in disappointment for me. So, I decided to stick with Olga and just order something other than a minimizer. I picked this specific bra based solely on reviews and also because it wasn't ugly. Much to my surprise (and delight) it fit perfectly! I even tried it on with a few button up shirts (which can be a real issue for us girls with a bigger chest) and there was no gaping and everything looked not only great but even better than it did with my old minimizers. I think I'll still look for a minimizer to have on hand for certain occasion, but now I'm not in a rush to find one. I'm very pleased with this purchase. The lift is great and without padding even! I'm still in shock."
"You can just rinse them off if they get dirty! I love these shoes, very stylish but oh so practical."
"I am really impressed with these shoes. It is always hit or miss when ordering shoes online, you never know how they're going to fit. Luckily, these shoes were right on the money. They are very comfortable and have great support, they don't even feel like I've been wearing flats all day. I chose the black and am happy that I did, they go with everything. as well.

A great buy at a great price. Would definitely recommend.

*I purchased this item with a discount in exchange for my honest review."
"Super comfy. I've been getting fussy about my shoes; with some giving me back pain but nothing after wearing these! I have them in
black and silver/white. Pretty much go with everything from jeans, yoga pants and capris..."
"The Capri length is perfect for my 5'3"" frame! These are easy wear, fit comfortably, go with anything, go to leggings. The company is fabulous to work with. They HEAR you! I would highly recommend this product and will definitely be buying these again."
Excellent product for the price - at least from a couple of weeks of use.
Great shoes.  My second ones.  Only advice is that if you don't need waterproof not to get the waterproof version as they tend to run hotter.  Nubuck seems to clean up from scuffs and remain casual/presentable for longer than the same finish in the non-nubuck version.  Second pair of Merrell slip-ons I've had.  I'll keep going with this brand.  Lots of convenient comfort for casual wear.
"The color was great. The only issue I had was one of the earrings was missing a back. It looked like they had been removed from the original package and the original plastic pack was inside another small zip lock bag. Super Jewelers has emailed and said they were going to replace the back that was missing but still have not received it. Would have given 5 stars if they were more prompt with their promise.
****Update****  On 2/28/14 I finally received the back from Super Jewelers. I changed the rating to 5 stars for them following up even if it did take longer than I felt it should have to replace one back."
Gave as Christmas Gift!
I wear 7 1/2 and ordered 8. Sent them back and got a 7 which fit great.
"Good fabric, seemed large."
daughter likes them
Wish there were more pockets but I knew that before I bought it  over all I love this bag
My son loves his shorts!!!!
The price is right for the quality and size. I must point out that pictures tend to be a little misleading but all and all a good item for a person that normally carries just the necessary to travel. My rating is no bigger than 4 stars (I like it).
I love theses sneakers. Perfect for working out in. I should get another pair just to walk around in.
"I have a drawer of bra's and don't like any of them, regardless of their price. I couldn't stop looking until I found the perfect one, this is it!! I got the 34 C, the fit is perfect, the material is soft, the straps are comfortable which is always an issue. This bra is perfect if you are looking for something that gives the right amount of support and lift. Now need one in several of the colors offered. It's a good day!!"
"I was looking for something unique and different for my husband's birthday. When I saw this ""Always be Batman "" t-shirt I just knew this was just the gift I needed to get for him. My husband is a huge Batman fan and is all the time telling me ""I'm Batman"". While he may never wear this shirt out of the house I just know he will get a kick out of it. He is all the time telling me how he needs more shirts so for the past several years I have been purchasing different shirts for him.

This shirt seems to be made up of well made quality materials; cotton. You can tell from holding it up that it is a thicker cotton and that it is well made. As of now I have mark the 'fit as expected' because for now without washing it, that is how it fits. If this changes or if it shrinks or anything happens once I wash it then I will update this review.  This shirt comes in many different color choices.  I went with my husband's favorite color - green.

In full disclosure, I was given a discount code when purchasing this product in return for an honest review. The fact that I received a discount code has NO effect on my review good or bad. Side note: I always update my reviews if anything changes."
"yes, your foot will slide forward, but that's what inserts are for. you can't expect the moon and stars with a $30 pair of shoes. they are a great value for the cost."
I bought the XL. I am 5'8' weigh 154 and this is a perfect fit. LOVE  this coat!  It looks as if it cost hundreds of dollars. The workmanship is amazing. It feels so good to the touch. It is comfortable to move in and the lovely hood keeps out the cold and wind. This is my gift from Santa.
first time I wore one of these and it made me look sharp!
"She loves the Champion with the panty feature, but she goes for this first.  Great color and looks good with everything.  Shorter than Champion but still wholesome."
Works great easy to use and made well. Withstood the airport handling
love this shirt. I want it in every color!
Over all great quality looks great but slightly to small in going order larger size
"The pendant is beautiful, much larger than I had expected.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to add this beautiful piece to their collection!"
Excellent quality-comfortable yet sturdy
"I love these socks!  I have bunion problems and arthritis in my toes.  I spent $50 a long time ago on gel separators and did not like them at all...too hard to put on.  I had another pair of socks similar to these and wore them out.  In the evening, when my feet are tired and achy, I put these on for about an hour and my feet feel so much better!  I am trying to avoid surgery by keeping my big toe from ""hammering"" and they are working.  You will not be disappointed!"
Very cute and warm but it was too big for our 10 month old.  Would fit a bigger 12 month old.  It's really pink.  I was hoping for more coral/orange but it's hot pink
"After reading people's posts I decided to order a size medium. I usually wear size 4 or sometimes a size 2 in dresses. The four is a little loose all around. I decided it was better to be loose then too tight.  I wear 32DDD in chest  so I thought it would be snug. It is not at all. It's actually a little loose in the armpits. I detected no odors and the packaging appeared new. There was one string at the base of the skirt that must've come loose and is hanging longer than the others. I will just take a scissor and snip it.  The dress is long on me I am 5'4"" and it falls just below my knees and is not risqu&eacute; at all. I bought it for a 20s party. It will be perfect for the event."
"One of the best slim wallets I've purchased. I've had multiple brands ranging from $10 Alpine Swiss slim wallets to the $80 Bellroy and this has quickly become one of my favorites.

*Warning*

I thought both ends of the cash opening had the secure elastic but it is actually only one side of the slot. The bills still stay in place while inside the wallet but the flap may begin to wear if you snag it on your pockets a lot."
Is a gift anyways but the material is nice
Holy Cats!  Stole this watch...what a wonderful machine for the price its incredible!
My new favorite T-shirt
Bought this for my husband who is always dumping things on his chest of drawers.  Works wonderfully and he loves it!  Now he's not searching for his changing and other what-nots!
Perfect. Great material. Might order a pair in the future.
Love the color love the shirt
I'm very please with this product and the prompt delivery. My daughter loves them.
I bought these for my husband who is a size 12 and he said these fit perfectly. He's had problems finding a comfortable shoe right out of the box but these fit the bill. The inside has a nice soft foam like insole. The soles are also solid which has been hard to find in a lot of shoes. He can walk hours in these without any discomfort. They can be dressed up or down. The dark brown goes well with jeans and casual pants. These are a very good looking comfortable shoe.
"True to size. I'm a 9-10 in women, so I got a 8 in men. Fit just right. The slides are pretty comfortable, too."
Very Happy. Feel so good and comfortable! Fit as expected. Thank you!
Altho I didn't recieve the black hat with white bill like was shown in the pic I still like the hat. It's the same colors just opposite of what's shown. Still pleased with it as it still matches the outfits I bought it to go with.
"Very good quality sterling silver, not flimsy or light weight.  Put it on and received two compliments in one day!"
"My kid loves this belt, a much better alternative to the adjustable, elastic baseball belts out there."
"The Color is gorgeous, as it is pictured, the Skirt is pretty and full with the ruffle on the very bottom.....The Fit is a little snug but works  ,( I wear a size 16 ) the Lining is a little smaller than the skirt so maybe that will keep it laying smooth around the waist and hips, anyway, I am pleased,  the length is perfect, I am 5 ' 7"" and it comes to mid calf or a little longer
I love it."
"Neat looking and smart. Warm without any frills. Nice, solid color. Zipper is solid. A bit itchy directly on the skin, but surprisingly not too much. Perfect for layering. I will get another color, or maybe even two. Highly recommended for those who do not like buttoned cardigans for work attire."
"I frequent the casinos and those are ideal!!at the casino, they will be a conversation piece also I will love them they fit perfectly"
"The reviews said it runs small so I got med. The medium was a bit to big, though not so much that it will fall off. I wear size 4 and the top does not cling to my stomach at all and acts almost like a dress. It should work just fine. It is really very cute."
I'm an 8.5 so I ordered an 8.5 and still kinda small. But other wise cute ring.
This was a great deal. The one problem is that it wasn't as gold as the picture seems. It's a bit more rustic. Non the less a great purchase and I'm glad a I bought it.
"Really thin, great light weight summer dress. 4 stars because you can kinda see my green bra through it."
This pant keeps me cool beautiful and comfortable
I prefer bibs to everything but skin for everyday wear.  These are up to Carhartt's normal quality.  For winter hiking when it is cold they are unbeatable.  The only issue I have is true for bibs in general - they tend to run long.
"Love it! Exactly what I was looking for...quality, utility, great looks. I've had perfect strangers at the grocery store ask me about it. Am saving up for my second one in another color!"
These were great. Worked well for dance class when we do turns across the floor. I have foot problems so dancing bare foot can be a problem for me.
Fit well and it met my expectations.
It's shurank as I expected and fit to me.
My husband has been searching for a sneaker he can slide on and off easily when in the house. When I saw these on Amazon I ordered them and he really likes them. They are comfortable and they look great.
Runs a little small. Nice jacket though
I got this for my daughter and she loves it...there's an odd smell so wash before wear and air out a couple days.
Helps your luggage stand on the airport carousels
I like this top. The color is beautiful. I may do some adjusting to it. I don't really see myself wearing it like a long top. I might sew the scrunches in.
"I usually wear an 8 1/2 shoe and the size 9 in this sandal just barely fit the length of my foot. I would suggest buying this a half size up.

Despite that, it is comfortable and cute. Recommended!"
Love carters clothes for kids! Our daughter has 2 twin boys and they are long. Some onsies are not long enough in the trunk area and do not fit properly. We have been using Carters from there birth! We also love the stretchable material and quality of the product
"These are great.  Fit is comfy, well made, and light weight compared to some of NB's shoes."
"they are not comfy but at least look really cute and I can wear them with anything, its good for the price"
It fit ok. I was expecting it to be a bit wider toward the front  Other than that it is a decent fit
"My baby daughter hates wearing tights, but during the cold months they provide extra warmth.  As a compromise I purchased these sock along with the Jefferies cable knee socks and some leg warmers.  She always chooses the knee high socks over the tights.  She stays warmer and I don't have to fight with her about wearing uncomfortable tights."
"Much longer than necessary, but the fit is snug - as it should be for an undershirt - and there is plenty of stretch in the fabric for movement and comfort. The length makes it difficult to tuck into slacks without it showing through, but at least it won't come untucked."
I usually buy  these socks for a gift for teenage boys. This pair is great! I LOVE how durable they are and just how cool they look. They are a great pattern and I have no doubt that my nephew will love them!
"This bra is pretty good quality and fits as expected.

The material is a little stiff so it's a little annoying pulling the flap down to feed. It doesn't want to stay down and gets in the way a lot.

It's very comfortable though. And the clasps are sturdy."
I purchased this for my son in law and he loves it.
The fabric feels like it's very well made and the shirt fits nicely as well.
"My husband always has two pairs of New Balance Men's MX608V4 Training shoes.  He uses one for work and one for casual wear.  His work requires him to stand on concrete for long periods of time on some days, and this shoe provides the support he needs.  It also comes in 4E width that he needs, and is difficult to find in a good shoe.  He has been wearing the New Balance 608's for years because they provide the support, width, and comfort that he needs and enjoys wearing."
I brought this pair of shoe for a cruise 2 years ago but did not get to wear them. This year I wore them to a wedding. Everyone loves them very comfortable.
nicde polo
It's shoe polish
"Big fan of these shoes, though the color I got them in is very sensitive to marking (spilled something, it splashed the shoes, and it looked terrible and was hell to get out).  I like shoes with minimalist soles/heels and that have a wide forefoot: these shoes have both.  These are pretty good looking shoes and, while I don't wear them like clogs outside, around the house you can slip into them as clogs and move around with less issues than you'd have with a pair of slippers."
Very comfortable and classic feel. Fits nicely and was exactly what I ordered.
love this so big and roomy. I rec'd so many compliments. Looking for satchel in same design
"not too big...not too small...not too hot...just right.  I ordered all the colors for my hubby...his (casual dress) office is so cold in the winter, these look great and do the job."
"This is a great midweight fleece, for in house on a chilly night, or running errands.  Would be interested in purchasing more in different colors."
"I feel for a one size fits all this was a bit on the small side. I just had my baby 3 weeks ago and I fit in a maternity size medium. This is really tight, almost to the point were I cant Velcro it. Everything else about it is fantastic! High quality material. I received it in the time stated. I would def recommend it!!"
Gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous! That's all I have to say!
"I've literally searched for years for the perfect shoe and I think I've found it.  I have a problem where when the back of the shoe is too high it rubs against my achilles.  I've searched all over for a mary jane that was stylish, yet goes with any outfit, and I had an extremely difficult time finding anything that met that criteria, let alone anything comfortable that didn't rub my achilles raw.  I went into a Takken's shoe store on a whim one day thinking if I have to get a shoe that's comfortable I guess I'll just have to settle for some ugly walking shoe.  I went in and the first shoe I noticed was this Dansko Tacey XP style.  I thought ""its too cute to be comfortable"".  I was totally wrong.  The back of the shoe is just short enough not to rub on me, but not so short that it completely slips off my foot.  The Dansko shoes are designed to slip a little in the back and provide a roomy box for the toes.  At first I didn't think a shoe that slips so much would be comfortable, but I've been walking around in them for 2 days and have not had any rubbing, nor has the shoe slipped completely off.  I also find that i haven't been clenching my toes in order to keep the shoe on, so my feet feel extremely relaxed.  The XP padding is really comfortable and offers a lot of arch support.  Apparently I have pretty high arches, so these  are just what I need.  I was told that nurses buy these shoes and now I see why.  You could literally walk around in them for 12 hours, get home and not want to take them off.  I highly recommend them.  And the best part is that I can wear them with a nice dress or in jeans and they still look great :)  I probably won't need another pair of shoes for at least the next five years!  the price is up there, but its totally worth it if I don't have to go shoe shopping ever again for the next half decade, especially with my stringent criteria for a proper shoe."
Nice and roomy to wear with thick socks
Very soft and the fit is great!
"Wasnt tight enough, it kept slipping but it does its job."
"The pants are light-weight and comfortable, the belt is a nice addition, although abit too long . I realized once I received it that I should have ordered it in a 36-32 as it was made in Bangladesh and sizes run smaller than US sizes. The 34-32 fit like a 32-32 so I sent it back and had a 36-32 sent to me. It fit the way a 34-32 would fit me. Now I'm happy with the pants, even though the belt's a little too long."
"My favorite shorts ever! I have a weird build and never think shorts are flattering on me, but these are! And good quality material."
"Frankly, for the price  I didn't expect these would be anything special. I was pleasantly surprised when I received them. They have lots of sparkle, and are a nice size. Very hard to tell they are not real!"
"Was looking for a gym bag that is not too big and this Adidas bag is perfect. You can fit gloves, change of clothes, toiletry and still have room for a pair of sneakers. Very happy with this."
"FITFLOPS are the only summer shoes I wear :-)
Super comfortable you could hike in these sandals
They are getting more stylish every year"
"I am age 62, 5'7-1/2"", and weigh 148 but feel young as a spring chicken in NYDJ slim leg jeans.  Actually I feel like a million bucks when I put these jeans on. After previously buying a couple of pairs in various styles in size 12 (which is what I thought I was), I have finally found the perfect fit in size 10 NYDJ slim leg jeans.  They are snug when you first put them on, but after about a half hour or so, they loosen up and mold to my body shape.  They are oh so great when paired with a tunic top, or a tank under a nice blouse. Do not make the mistake of buying them too big like I first did. Once you find your true size in NYDJ, you will discover that these are the best fitting jeans you ever had. I prefer the slim leg myself. I bought them in black and am very happy with the material - not too thin and not too thick.  Turn them inside out when you wash them and use cold or warm water - not hot, and they will stay dark black longer."
This Doctor Who necklace is so realistic. My niece who is the ultimate doctor who fan just loves it. She wears it almost everyday.
I'm obsessed with this wig. My husband loves it and I get compliments from everyone lol even drive through employees. It's not too shiny and looks very natural. The bright side of it being so so long is that you can cut it to a good style
"Very nice, received many compliments"
"The stone seems a bit clear, but maybe that's typical of this type of stone.  This was also true of the other piece of jewelry I received from another company.  Great ring otherwise!"
Best arch support by far.
Very comfortable dress. Perfect for the summer and vacations.
"Super comfy and cute -- I'm a true size 7 and they fit perfectly. I was worried because people said they ran narrow but fit perfectly on my feet. The color is dark but can match many things. I wish the other colors were available to purchase as well. The lace strings don't stay bowed well but it's only nit picking. I bought them on sale, wouldn't buy them full price only because it's still quite expensive."
"Great value, in terms of fit, quality and price."
These shoes are really cute and comfortable.  I can wear them all day with no problems.  I am also on my feet all day and these are great.  I really do love these shoes.
Little one looked too cute and loved the outfit!
"Nambe is a favorite of ours - we have many pieces of metal, granite, and crystal around our house. I keep this by the sink in our master bath and I love to give it as an engagement present to friends too. It's heavy, small but decorative and useful. I recommend it."
Needs sole padding ...
I bought these for my 4year old and they are perfect. He wears a 4T but sometimes the waist is too big but he needs the length. However these snow pants with the adjustable velcro sides are a perfect fit! I hope to get at least two seasons out of them if not more but then be able to use them for his younger brother later. He has skied and played in the snow with them and they kept in dry and warm. The only con to them we have experienced so far is that there was no loop or belt loops to attach a ski lift ticket to. Not a big deal but good to know. I like the idea of the grow system but I haven't used it yet to give a review on it.
My husband loves this! He uses everyday for his work boots. Saves him from backache.
Loved the shoe but much too large - had to return them. No smaller size available.
"I love them, I've bought like so many their my #1 favorite. They don't ride up, they hold my carves and I feel great in them."
I bought this to wear under my Wonder Woman costume and it was EXACTLY what I needed.  I wouldn't wear them as plain old shorts but it was perfect for my costume.  I will wear them to lounge around the house in because they are very comfortable.  I usually wear a size 6 so I had no issues with them being too tight or small.
Very nice fitwell nice cotton shirt grandson loves it
"Cute little girl's sandals.  When she increased a size we just ordered another pair.  Good value, cute shoe"
"i am a true 6.5 but ordered the 6 because there was a lot of room in the toe...i am petite and felt that the 6.5 looked to bulky.
still waiting for the 6 to arrive so i can compare the fit but i did want to let people know that the heel is plastic and not the traditional stacked leather heel.  Really not happy with that detail on a pair of boots that cost nearly $300.  I will probably take them to my cobbler to redesign the heel in the traditional way.  I hate when manufacturer's cut corners and don't tell you why they modified the design....most likely to cut costs and think people won't notice... not cool Frye."
"This product is a very sturdy yet pliable vinyl material, it's definitely going to last a while but it's not the color I expected. I ordered the 'rose red' color and online it looks like a pinky/red color and it's very dark in person. Almost brown or maroon. The closest to red I would classify is oxblood and that's still too red for this color.

On the bright side it does have tons of pockets and as long as the color doesn't bleed on the inside o my bag if damp, I will be completely satisfied.

PROS: Pockets, very portable, easy to use and transport,offers a lot of space for little volume.

CONS: Color, netting feels very fragile."
"Great pant. These feel a little tight when you first put them on, but loosen up throughout the day.  I bought a 12 and a 14.  The 14s get baggy by the end of the day.  I like these with the poly/cotton/spandex blend vs. just the cotton/spandex."
My scarf arrived within two days and it's warm I love it.
"Lots of room. High quality materials.  Cute.  Comfy to carry.
Wish the magnetized middle section would stay closed."
I fell in love with Sketchers years ago - then the lawsuits because idiots did not know how to walk took them off the market. I was overjoyed to see the 2.0 version on Amazon reasonably priced! I bought these for work as I was having sever sciatica pain and I wear them as my dress shoes on most days of the week!
These are really comfortable.  I really like the support.  And the rubber sole.  We have hardwood floors and with these slippers I haven't  had any close calls at all!  Very satisfied with this purchase.
"Love, love, love these boots.  So sexy and stylish.  I had been stalking these boots on amazon for a while.  Finally made my decision once they appeared on the lightening deal.  Fits as expected.  Interior has a nice soft lining.  The rhinestones add just the right amount of ""bling"" to make these boots stand out.  Definitely recommend.  Will be buying in a different color."
"My SIL loves these boots wears them whenever posible because after all they are Fryes, who would not. Not my thing, however younger people than me will love them"
Nice shoe.  I just tried on for a short amount of time around my home to test the size.  So far so good but I have not worn the shoe for any extended period of time.
Very comfortable shoe very good material. Runs just the right fit you don't have to run a size bigger or smaller
Im large breasted. Front close minimizes chest.  Fits perfectly.
"These arrived, I put them on, and went straight out on a run. They are excellent running shoes, good looking, and as a tend to put weight on the sides of my feet, made me feel as if I had finally arrived in the best shoe for me. Asics just earned a 40 year Nike customer, even my knees felt great. I have been running since before running shoes were invented, and these are hands down the best shoes I have ever put on. I hope they last the hundreds if miles I will put on them, but that is another review."
"Thank you very much for your help and information, I am very happy with the purchase"
"I ended up getting 2 of these necklaces for friends and I'm so glad I did.  They are shiny and pretty on the front and engraved on the back, with the Journey statement.  I don't recall reading that in the description, but am so happy with them, I could have bought more for that price.  They are quite lovely."
"Great leggings, great price!"
Not as well made as I thought they would be but nice.
"nice product, great price"
nice! 
"Weight 99 kg. And my height is 1.75 mt. The size 3x-4x is perfect for me. Buy the beige city color and the fantasy black, both colors are perfectly combinable with the clothes, in the photograph I am wearing the city beige color, the fit is perfect and comfortable. They are excellent for the office because I can use them almost all day without discomfort and they look great."
This purse is so soft and still able to carry all you need I love it
Nice fit. Love it.
"For the price, I use these indoors then when my outdoor ones wear out, I use the indoor ones outside. Very comfortable and long lasting."
Great experience. Fast shipping.
Nice color...nice style but just little loose ..I should have gone one size down but still fits so I like it.
Excellent jeans to work
"great boots. very comfortable. you'll only get the leather ones if you get the original, not the 2nd edition."
"Is nice and doesn't look cheap but it is a little big for one size, I'm between 8-10 and it falls even using the tightest hook. Other than that, it looks nice and I think it fulfills the purpose for what I bought it, which is not holding tights but completing a sexy lingerie set."
"Just discovered this clothing line and I LOVE IT!!!  Way better than the styles Victoria's Secret used to make.  This top is nicely made of quality fabric.  The seams inside are finished nicely, as are the edges of the trim.  This is a very comfortable top in a medium weight knit.  I'm 5'4"" 108 pounds, 32b bra and the Small fits great.  Will be ordering more!"
Great product. Came quickly and fit as expected. Color was exactly as shown. Material was good and not too flimsy. Very happy with my purchase. My bridesmaids all loved it.
We needed these for my son's dog tags.
Fits well; looks super cute.
My daughter enjoyed having it
"these did the job I needed them to do, and they held up with all the rugged work required of me and held together in the wash. I was amazed the color didn't fade like it thought it would."
exactly what I wanted nice color mixes well with what I already have. If you are looking to mix metals this is really a great one
"They came way too long. I ordered 38x36 and they fit more like 38x40. They seem like sturdy pants and though a bit stiff, I assume a few washings will remedy that. The lining does help keep them warm and block much of the wind from reaching your legs. Being FR and lined I would say they are not too bad on the price. I will probably order more next time I have to work in a colder climate on a FR job. The lining is not very thick, so if you are somewhere very windy or on the extreme end of the cold spectrum, you may need another layer."
I like the style very much. I have not been a fan of Crocs in the past because their styles looked clunky to me. These are very sleek and not clunky at all. I saw them in an internet article by a doctor recommending comfortable shoes to wear all day. I have only worn them one day (still a little cool here) but they were comfortable.
These are ok but I expected them to be a bit longer since clogs are usually roomy. I ordered my exact size and had to ear it with the back on at all times - otherwise my feet slide out and hang out at the back.
Initially it feels like it would be too small. But it easily pulled down and had a firm grip on my head. Didn't blow away in the wind but not too tight to be uncomfortable
"Beautiful leather, but it's more of a suede than leather feel to it.  The sole is more on the hard side.  When walking, they have that ""clacking"" sound like you hear teachers walking through the hallway."
"I'm a size 12/14 and these fit so well. They do not show any separation in the fibers when they stretch out, so even on my bigger body, they fit perfectly. The material is soft and warm. The colors are vibrant. These seriously rock. Check out the photo to see for yourself."
"Looks so nice and my husband loves it. My husband figured out that it has a magnet, so he keeps it on the fridge so that he doesnt loose it and to keeo away from the kids.
I was skeptical because in the pictures I didn't think it looked very nice, but I am glad I went ahead and ordered it. It looks really nice, especially when it has money.
It is really sturdy."
I love these sandals. And they look like they should last me a while before I buy my next pair of sandals. I wear these as house shoes when it's warm outside as well as out in the streets
"Very Pretty I really like the length looks great dressed up or down!
I'll be buying more colors!"
I purchased one for my daughter and loved it so much that I ordered one for my self. LOVE IT!
Very Light weight
"Since tees with pockets are hard to find, I'm very pleased with these.  They fit well and also wash well."
"Love these. Great fit, great price."
"Love these water shoes!  I use them for cutting grass, swimming, the beach.....anything summertime!"
This was a gift for a nine year old and she loves it.
The double layer of cloth over the crotch makes for some sweaty balls.  Better for the winter.
I order bigger and very happy with it it is a little thin you can see thru it.
I love them. They are cute. I love the way they look on my feet. They are comfortable. Wore them for hours and that felt fine. I would buy them again.
"Fit as expected, order Medium. I'm 5' 2"" 36 C bra. Thin material, but it looks great and it's a very formal dress for work."
"These are warm Jammie's. Nice thick material that is soft and fuzzy. My son loves putting them on, on cold nights. I like that they keep him nice and warm even when he kicks off his covers. The colors are great and don't fade when washing."
"These are very nice sun glasses. They do the job. Cut out the glare, and also gives you better ability to see what you are looking at. They lighten up your world. 5 stars..."
way better then i even expected. size is spot on and i had no idea the inside was cheetah print. it just adds to my love for it. please note when you walk on hard ground it sounds like your wearing heels. i for one love that sound (:
"Somewaht small in the waist, I returned it"
SUPERIOR QUALITY.  I couldn't be more pleased.  Wonderful price as well.
Quality is excellent.
"I bought this for my grandson and he said it fit well, was soft and comfortable."
"We read the reviews about the slimmer fit, so we originally ordered the small. It was too big, so we returned it and ordered this one (XS).
It is true-to-size US men's XS, on the slimmer fit side. My 24 year old son wears men's extra small in several brands, he has a 36 inch chest, is about 5'5"", and weighs about 123 lbs. He fits well in the American Apparel style slimmer fit XS, but the Gap's traditional style looser fit men's XS is loose on him. If you want a looser fit, order the small.
The coat is long. He is 5'5""-5'6"" or so, and the XS's zipper starts just above his knees. The men's small is longer, and on him, the zipper started at his knees- a little too long.
The coat quality is good- it is fully lined, and the seams are sturdy. This coat is a heavy cotton- kind of a twill, but smooth and a true black. I think the coat will hold up for many years. The collar folds down or stands up with extra height- zipping all the way up -it's a nice fierce look. We are very happy with the coat. It is a unique style that we couldn't find anywhere else, and we will buy this brand again."
A good long sleeve T shirt at a reasonable price.
fine hat thank you
"Very nice soft feel, fits very well, fees good in my shoes and very well constructed.  I purchased these many many years ago and their beginning to wear out."
Needed some non-slip socks for my Pilates reformer classes. I didn't like the socks with individual toes. These fit well and work as expected. Highly recommended!
"Beautiful , I luv them!"
My husband wears this shirt proudly.  The quality and fit are both excellent and the color hasn't faded from washing.
Arrived promptly & was as pictured
"My daughter uses these exclusively for her flat feet. The part on the inside edge of the sole is firm, which prevents the foot from turning in more, and that's what her orthopedic doctor recommended (he mentioned these specifically, along with a few other brands that had the same support).
Ever since she started wearing these, her foot, knee, and leg pain have been reduced significantly. I can always tell when she does not have them on in the morning, and once she puts the on she walks normal.

Because she is so active, she must get a new pair about every 6 months. It's well worth the cost. They fit ""as expected"", but she DID have her foot measured for the correct size. Having the correct size is VERY important."
I am normally a shoe size 7.5 but i bought a size 7 and they fit perfect. They are very comfortable. I plan on using them for an upcoming vacation to the beach.
Better than I expected. Very cute.
"Works great! Somewhat large profile, but that's not really a problem, as it makes the start/split button easier to find by feel while on the run."
Nice small purse for evenings
Love it! Does what I want it to!
"Really nice rash guard.  I ordered an XXL, and its a good fit - not skin tight, but a bit loose (I'm 5'8"" and about 220lbs).  I wanted some sun protection for a long horseback ride in the hot sun on the beach, and I was afraid it would be too hot, but I could feel the wind blowing through it and I didn't feel overheated.  The material is a nice thickness - not cheap feeling.  Its a good length too.  If pulled tight straight down, would reach to my hips.  Wearing it normally with a bit of a bunch to the material still left a nice length, with no gaping at the waistband if you bent over.  Can't beat the cute color inserts either.  :)"
The color is different than what was showed. It looks more like earth tone than Mandarin.  Individual who has width feet would not be able to fit the shoes
Great color and everything about sneaker I love I got this with my boyfriend and he absolutely fell in love with it.. It fit perfectly on him
Really comfy shoe I wear them all the time. Good for walking and working
"Fits very nicely and looks awesome, the package arrived 1 day earlier than said which is always nice."
These are my favorite scrub pants. Just enough pockets for everything I need to carry and comfy too.
Excellent belt and it's adjustable. Very stylish. Thank you.
"Cute!! Love the olive green! Not see thru ! Looked a bit small upon arrival but surprisingly fit me perfectly, a Small as my usual size is 0/1, I'm 5'4 107 ib."
"Purchased for a college student.  Excellent!  Roomy,sturdy, and nice looking. Would highly recommend."
great to wear under a jacket or for business casual
Fit perfectly and felt as if they had already been broken in. I am very satisfied.
Nice looking luggage tags.  Quick to identify luggage.
I like the slippers they're kind of roomy around my feet..
"Love this shoe, very comfortable, classy, versatile & quality."
I absolutely love these shoes!!!!!!  I am a pug lover so they were above and beyond my expectations. Not only are they adorable but they are comfy as well.  If I could afford it I would buy them in every color:)
I bought this for my husband for his birthday. We are huge X Files fans and I saw this and thought it was funny! It's very soft and fits perfect! I read some reviews but I don't agree with it being cheap. It's a very nice material and the screen image hasn't faded off. We're really happy with the shirt!
I LOVE THESE SHOES. THEY ARE THE BEST FITTING. JUST WISH  THEY HAD SOME SUBDUED COLORS FOR OLDER SNEAKER WEARERS. LOVE THE SIVLER AND BLUE. NO LONGER AVAILABLE.
had to sew up the sides (slits) but fits great
GREAT FIT AND VERY COMFORTABLE
"Very good quality. Fit my small 6"" wrist perfectly."
Worked amazingly well. The batteries you use to keep this inflated last a very long time. Costume is easy to put on and it doesn't get very hot inside when the air pump is going.
"Bought these as a Christmas gift for my cousin, who prefers small stud earrings.  These are tiny but beautiful, and I can't wait to give them to her!"
Nice fit. Could of been a bit more stretchy on the upper ankle area but other than that overall nice fit
This outfit is just so adorable :). Just got my order and i love it. Fits good and she has room to feel nice and cozy thanks :*)
"This is a really cute garment. But it is not as long as it looks in the photo.  Also,  forearms are pretty damn slim.  Not too small, but something to be aware of if you have full arms."
"I ordered in a 2 and 4 and the 2 fit better. I am 5'3 and 125lbs. Its a very stretchy, nice material. I loved this dress but it ended up being a little too fancy for the event I was going to and I don't really need a gown for just anything so I returned it, but I really did love it and would have kept it if I had somewhere to go."
These sandals have been very comfortable walking around Europe on my vacation.
"I bought the 2t/3t paw patrol underwear for my son, he's almost 3 but small for his age and these seem a bit snug to fit a 3t kid. The graphics are cute and they fit ok, but if you have a bigger 2yo or 3yo I'd buy a size up. Otherwise they were a huge hit for our potty training little man."
"Approx 6 years ago I got one of these, my very first Birkenstock. They are just perfect. They last, they are beautiful and comfortable. Decided to retire old pair and this new one. It is exactly the same. Amazing consistency with a great product over the years."
Warm and looks cut.
"Love these on my toddler, they are so cute and stylish."
Lots of Sparkle
"Perfect, comfy, just what  I wanted!  I'm very curvy and they fit great with the drawstring."
Wish the pants were a bit longer as I'm 5'9 and shirt was smaller. But I expected it to be a little bit bigger. Overall good product
Great packing cube. Purchased for a gift.  This is my 4th order from Bagail and will only buy this product. The material is sturdy yet doesn't add weight.  Zipper pulls are much better than other brands.  I have purchased many other packing cubes from other manufacturers and Bagail makes the best product.
Very cute shoes! I absolutely love the style and the color and the fit perfectly.
Excellent Product. Better than my Original Army Fleece Jacket. This is just as warm in a sleek and smaller format. Now I can be warm AND wear a Gore Tex Jacket without looking like a bear
Sooooo comfortable and gorgeous
"It seems to fit true to size.  It is cute, but the material is a bit thin.  I could see through the white stripes fairly easy.  Definitely would want to wear the right undergarments when wearing this dress."
These are so cute and comfortable! They feel silky too. I'm going to buy them in all the available colors.
These are fabulous. They are enormous though so only buy if you can rock them with attitude.
My daughter is very excited about her set. Great purchase
They are like wearing comfy shoes in the house. I can wear them with or without socks. They have great support as do all of my Vionics.
"Initial charging time is quite long, but adequately disclosed in the instructions.  Once fully charged it is working well."
this is perfect ~ it goes very well with several tops i have
They fit but not perfectly.
These are very comfortable and I got them when they were on sale so I'm very pleased!
I have flat feet and these have helped to alleviate all pain I had in my ankles and knees from it. Highly recommend!  I also own the orthoheel slippers because walking in wood floors barefoot is killer after time. I will be buying more orthoheel in the future.
"The brown vest that I received was much darker in color (almost black, in fact) than the online photo.  However, I decided to keep it anyway, since leather goods are usually not uniform in color.  The vest itself was well-made and a comfortable fit."
"I love these so much!!!!!  They just came in and i admit i was a tad skeptical but they were perfect!!!  Ive seen tons of sizing questions on here so ill add my sizes to better help other ladies choose theirs.  Im 5ft 10in, 157 lbs , size 6-7 wemons pants, 13-14 pants in juniors....i purchased the medium set and they fit perfectly i feel i probably could have even purchased a small and been fine as the fabric is forgiving... Im also a mom and have some excess skin problems from my baby belly and thats why i purchased these panties.... I can honestly say that these panties are definitely great shapeware/gurtle panties for the price... For the first time in 13 years i can wear a snug dress and feel confident about my body!!!!  I know it sounds silly but these undies just made my day ! Ladies these are a great buy!!!!!

Update ,its been almost two weeks since i purchased these and they really do slim me down quite a bit and i still love them the only issue i have had is a rather strange one... I headed the warning of another review and washed all of these garments twice by themselves before wearing them and all was well until i finally wore the black pair ...its rather embarrassing but they dyed my skin black even after i washed them 2 times , its really common with certain black dyes but i just wasn't expecting that lol so i highly recommend washing the black pair alone in hot water with either a harsh detergent or a little bit of bleach just to rid the garment of any exess dyes... All and all even with my discoloration i still stand behind my earlier statements, they really are pretty nifty"
One of my favorite pieces bought off Amazon
Nice material. Fits perfectly.
"i really liked the dress, but it is quite small in the bust area so i had to return it."
My 10 yr. old daughter wore this cape for her vampire costume.  It dragged behind her but she said that it made her look more spectacular.
I absolutely love everything about this tunic. True to size. I wore it to work with leggings and boots and received many compliments!
Fits great and is a fun outfit!
"I was looking for a leather checkbook cover with a outside id slot. This was the only one I found.
Fortunately, it is well-made and decently priced. I would recommend it."
"I love this, it's one of the few Vera Bradley patterns that doesn't make me throw up in my mouth.  The only things I have against it is that my phone is too big for it, which I knew it wasn't going to fit but I wish they made a bigger size.  Also, the slot for cash is a little awkward, all my bills get crumpled no matter what I do."
"Love this dress and the price was grrrrreat!  The colors are as pictured.  The dress is super cute.  It's comfortable.  It does run a little small.  It is above the knees.  I am 5'7"" with an athletic build.  I would purchase again.  I would recommend to others.  You should size up if you aren't slim."
Large in hips
Its a nice dress but was not long enough the picture shows a long maxi dress only came below my knees and i'm only 5'3 the material is very soft runs a little big order a xl and  i wear a xl .
Very beautiful! The comfort fit is nice. The engraving is lovely!
Got it for my sister on her birthday . The fit is great . She loved it . Wished they had it petite size . Good dress in the afternoon for going out. As well as very comfortable fit. Liked it !
I love these shorts. I have these shorts and the shorter ones. They dry so quick. I just wish they had more pockets instead of just one pocket on the side.
Not exactly the style shown but very close.
Great beard.  The mouth opening was wider than expected but we were able to manipulate it to appear smaller.  We used this to create Stinky Pete from Toy Story :)
"I was worried that it was going to be too yellow,  but I think it is good!  It looks nice and weathered"
"The boots are well made, but as other reviewers have already stated, they are extremely difficult to get on a child's foot.  However after a few days the laces seem to loosen up and allow for an easier slip on.  Not bad for the price I paid."
This is my 4th Eco Drive Citizen watch and by far the most special and beautiful. This was a gift from my husband. I had seen the plain stainless model at my local jewelers and like it but once I saw the 2 toned watch I fell in love with it. My patience paid off and we got this for an excellent price on Amazon and I love it. Beautiful and goes with everything! The picture does not do it justice. My only question is the water resistant feature....would it really be fine if I forgot to take it off for the shower or heaven forbid fall in a swimming pool.
"Fit as expected, good price too."
"My son loves these. they fit him just right, i ordered size 10 which normally is too long or too big in the waist but hes too large for size 8. these fit him perfectly. they are warm and on nights like tonight when its 6 degrees and then with winshield -10 its needed."
These were  great for a Saint Patrick's Day softball tournament.
"These little guys are essential for anybody that wears athletic shoes or boots for multiple hours of the day. I have gone through trying many powders and sprays to help with moisture in the feet and odors throughout the day. These guys are the absolute best!  Don't get me wrong, I still wash my sneakers in the washing machine frequently, will still put a little powder and a little spray if needed, but the addition of these balls in my sneakers every night has really helped. I also suggest putting these in gym bags."
"Good fit, not too thick or bulky, warm enough on a cold day if you're being active. You'll need to anti fog your glasses as your breathing will fog your lenses."
High quality and looks great.
Absolutely love my ring. Have received compliments on it.
Purchased as a remembrance gift after having lost my precious girl. It's beautiful! Both charms are well crafted. Be aware that the chain is quite delicate and will break easily. I wanted a longer necklace so this purchase was strictly made for the charms to be placed on a different chain.
This shoe is really fabulous!!! I love this color. Can't wait to wear this winter with nice textured stockings. Luv them!!!
"Bought these in Dark Brown for my husband. The minute he put them on, he loved them. True to size and they look great. Perfect for casual dress up and even with jeans. I just love penny loafers and I'm stoked my husband does, too!!! At the deal we got them, these are wonderful. Frye's rock!"
PERFECT FOR OUR HAWAIIAN VACATION AND YOU CAN WEAR THEM WITH EVRYTHING
"This is the pretties package I have received in a long time! I felt so fancy opening up the organza purple bag. Inside the bag was the cutest ring box, black with gold polka dots, and a gold card insert. One side of the insert says: The Circle. Infinity. Life. Love. The other side is a ring symbolism quick guide, telling you the meanings of what finger you choose to wear your ring on.

I love all these adorable extras, it really makes me feel like SPUNKYsoul cares about us girlie girls. It was definitely a great experience opening this ring and would be a perfect treat to give as a gift. Whomever the recipient of this ring would feel special and pampered with all the extra touches added to the packaging.

The ring itself is dainty and feminine. The twist gives it the right amount of interest to keep it classy and simple. I've been wearing it all week with no skin issues whatsoever. It's light and comfortable. My fingers have the tendency swell in my sleep so I usually take off any rings I am wearing so they are not tight on my finger in the morning. I've forgotten to take off this ring at bedtime and woken up the next day to it being as comfy as the night before.

I would recommend this ring and company SPUNKYsoul, the ring makes a great gift for someone special or for yourself!  The packaging is unique and delightful to open and the ring is dainty and classic.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for a fair and honest review."
These work great for me .  got tired of pulling my pants up about 20 times a day.  What use to hold them up is there anymore.
I bought these for my mom and she lives them
Great. Sturdy and durable. A must have for any frequent traveler
Beautiful Ring Better then wat I expected!! BIG YESSS TO THOSE WHO CANT DECIDED TO BUY THIS OR NOT
"Tight, smooth, and crinkle at the ankle."
Seems comfortable for everyday walking.  Will probably order more of these down the road.  The top strap takes a little time to get use too.
Best at such a cheap price. Amazon has amazed me with all my shopping. It's perfect size and material quality is good.
"This crossbody hand bag is everything I could have wanted, the leather is very soft, and the bag is roomy, I can fit my large wallet, along with my 5.7 screen lg Stylo cell among other thing in the bag! I also purchased the brown bag as well. I will be ordering the red, blue and Ivory soon! I absolutely love my crossbody handbag!!!"
"I'm a slipper hoarder..  I love these slippers. I'm a stay at home mom so whenever I am home I'm in my slippers and these are the only pair I've been wearing. So comfortable, wellmade, and will no doubt last. Reading the other reviews prior said they ran small so I sized up. I really don't recommend that I had to return them to get my normal size And the got is perfect. Couldn't be happier with this purchase otherwise.."
"pretty little divers watch for my girl friend , she is an avid swimmer in the sea in summer and at a pool in winter , i hope this watch is really water proof for swimming ...... we will soon find out and I will be back to let ya'll know"
read the reviews.....took a chance....soooo glad I did....just like the Ray Bans I owned in  the 80s......just like Dirty Harrys from original movie....great quality.....very impressed
Fits perfectly! And comfortable!
The socks are very nice for the price.
"these things fit great, don't ride up on you, and are 100% cotton, which is important in case you are anywhere near an arc flash.
ideal for electricians."
Love this bag. I got it to handle my 17 inch work laptop which fits perfectly snug into the dedicated pocket. Has the right amount of storage for an everyday back pack with great accessibility of pockets. And I always love a front grab handle and this one is very comfortable to handle. Ive loaded it up to 20lbs in the bag and it felt great on a 3 mile walk. I feel like I could easily wear this for 20 and not even notice. My only wish for improvement it that it had a softer lining for the sunglasses pocket but I doubt it would scratch my glasses anyways. If I lost or destroy this backpack Id Buy it again and thats the highest praise I can give.
Well made and smart looking.  Goes well with khaki pants.
"I hardly ever wear anything else anymore. These are good-looking, comfortable and sturdy shoes that last for years."
Very nice.. fits true to size.
"I liked what I got, the only problem was the stocking, one was definitely smaller than the smaller in size. The breast area has an awkward seam, in my opinion seems outta place, but I can by pass it. Overall it's a pretty good buy."
"I love buying us polo clothing on Amazon because it's a great brand and they sell it for cheap prices so I don't have to spend a ton of money to have my son dressed nicely. I got this in the orange color because my son normally wears red, black, or blue and wanted something different in his wardrobe."
I was in love with the kit
Love it! Very good minimizer comfortable bra.
"The piece between the toes is a little uncomfortable when you first put them on, but you get used to it quickly.  It would be a 5 star shoe if not for that."
I Love this shirt and it fits perfectly and very form fitting.  
"Running in these shoes isn't exactly like running barefoot; it's better.  It's like running in soft, practically weightless slippers.  Although I mainly use these on roads and treadmills (flat surfaces), on rocky terrain there is still adequate protection.  Averaging about 40 miles per week, I anticipate getting at least six months of use out of these shoes, but I wouldn't be surprised if they lasted much, much longer because the construction and materials seem so solid.

For my first pair of true ""barefoot"" shoes, I couldn't be happier.  Only minor soreness accompanied my first few runs, but now my feet feel stronger than ever.  Literally, I can feel how muscular my feet have become--in a good way.

Out of any other minimalist running shoe I have tried, these are my absolute favorite.  Merrell, thank you!"
"I bought this case to hold all my rings.  The size is nice.  It lays so flat you can put it in a drawer.  I would not call the material it is made out of ""high quality"" like the description says.  It ripped fairly easily.  No big deal because it isn't nice enough to leave out anyway, but it does organize all my rings nicely. I don't think I would recommend this item due to the price and the material.  It is not worth the price."
"Wear this constantly, to bed, shower, chain is durable. Detail is beautiful. Picture shown with US nickel."
"Fit as expected, great quality & price"
So good I though it may bite ....
Great comfort for me.  Pretty soon the style will be discontinued.  So try to get many as you can for your comfort.
"Nice looking, comfortable warm boot.  They felt a little heavy at first but only took a little getting used to."
This a very nice garment.
"Great detail, good buy!"
"This is pretty cute and it food exactly what i needed it to. I used it to cosplay for a character at comic-con and it worked!
The only small issue, is that while it fit really well, the button right over the chest area was being stadiums a bit"
"Love dress nice fit
not red really burgundy but I still love it"
Great sweat-top
I love these watches
They weren't kidding when they said this shoe was designed for women.  Holy COW!  Never wore anything this solid yet flexible before.
"I like these thigh bands because I love to wear dresses when it's hot, but I don't want to wear panty-hose or leggings under my dress. These thigh bands have silicone grips on the inside to keep them in place on your legs. My only complaint is that on the back of the leg they roll down a little bit, but it's not that noticeable. Also I can't wear them with light colored knit dresses, because the fabric material kind of shows through - the fabric of my dress kind of catches on the fabric of the thigh bands, so my dress doesn't flow smoothly.  I guess the smooth fabric (non-lace) ones would be fine with my knit dresses, but I only have the lace ones. Overall, I was happy with the price I paid, the product came quickly, the fit is perfect based on the size chart they provided, and I'm glad I bought these!"
These are super fun! They come right to the knee and have a nice opening in the back!
Great replacement bag since my last one broke. Convenient size and fits everything I need.
Great shorts!  Plenty of pockets with well designed flaps to secure what you have in them.  They fit just like the long pants with all the same features.
These offer my foot great support. They were just what I needed after fracturing my foot.
Fit good.  Works great.
So awesome. Fits great. Very good quality.
All the minecraft loving kids I know love this shirt.
"I ordered this ring dish as a sample for review and evaluation and I just love it. I don't think the picture does it justice it's so lovely in person. There is plenty of room in the dish for multiple items. Currently I have a large ring and a necklace in mine that I routinely take off before I shower. Before I would just lie them on the sink and if I was to not wear them for the day they just stay on the sink looking messy and liable to fall off. This keeps them safe, clean and adds a nice touch to the bathroom. I am very happy with this. I wish that it would come in a box for easy gifting and protection during shipping. Overall though it's exactly what I wanted and looks perfect."
I Love it! Pretty. Solid sterling silver. Wel worth the money- great deal. Would recommend. Shipped fast.  No complaints at all.
I like the 620 style. They feel a little tight at first but then they stretch out. A good casual shoe.
Great pants! They were perfect for my son!
This is the second pair I've had of these boots.  The first pair wore pretty well as I only use them about two weeks every month.  At that they lasted me about two years before the eyelets wore out.  High humidity environment and the boots were going strong when the metal eyelets finally gave up.  Heavy enough to protect your feet but light enough for our tropical climate.  They run about a half size large which was as advertised so order accordingly. Great value if you're looking for a medium use boot.
"Love this shoe, bought another almost like this and is extremely comfortable."
"This dress fits good and looks good too.  I had gotten this on sale and was fortunate enough to because I am glad I have it to wear in this hot and humid conditions.  I like the colors and the picture does not give it justice for it looks a lot nicer and looks really great on too,  Nice fabric and has great lines. Colors are a real plus too.  I know I am happy I chose this dress because I will get a lot of use with it.  Lots of ways to dress it up or down too!."
Love it more than I expect it fits all my stuff and even my iPhone 6s Plus in the zipper part plenty of room for a lot of cards and it's a great quality i highly recommend this wallet
"I received this today; 2 weeks early, I ordered a large because I wear a medium and read several reviews on the fit running small. It fits perfectly. It is just as beautiful in person as online; however, the green material is so sheer you will have to wear something under it."
Great shirt! My husband liked it when my kids gave it to him for Father's Day. Perfect for a trip to Disney also.
This was my second pair of Merrel's These look better with jeans.
"I'm 5' 6"" and 130 lb, this fit perfectly! Didn't rip and was stretchy and looked great! And a great price!"
I have largeish hands but I'm not overweight. (my ring finger is size 8.5). These feel comfortable and stretch to fit. The arms feel comfortable and go up above my elbows as I wanted. They are soft and beautiful. Appear white as advertised.
Very pretty my daughter loves them. I'll update oh there's a problem.
I love these because they are the least expensive and best fitting ones that I can find only. It is very difficult to find packs of these underwear with the pockets for removable pads. I do not use the pads that come with the underwear even though there is nothing wrong with them. I use my larger heavier silicone pads that fit perfectly. I am posting pictures below. The first picture has the underwear with the padding that comes with them. The next picture is with my silicone pads and the last picture is the silicone pads next to the pads that come with the underwear. These underwear are extremely comfortable. I have shopped for multi packs of these panties and they usually run about $36 for 2 pair! Although the silicone pads are much larger they look and feel much more natural than the pads that come with the underwear. I get a lot of compliments when I wear these!
"amazing quality.  clear and light catching.  love, love, love these earings"
"I haven't worn them yet but I did try them on.  I love the way they fit, just hope they're comfortable to wear all day."
Absolutely ADORABLE!  Fits on my head just like it does with the girl in the picture..SO happy with this cute wool hat.
"Looks excellent. I think it looks like the price, so don't buy expecting to fool anyone into thinking it was hundreds of dollars, but I certainly got an excellent gift and the price was great."
Very soft inside and warm - I have worn it every day since I got it!
"Super soft, excellent fit, very sexy, simply adore"
My daughter absolutely loves this dress is beautiful. It comes with a metal hoop. To make the dress look bigger around the bottom but it's removable. I haven't let her wear it yet so I don't know how she'll do with that but I can always take it out if she don't like it. Very silky soft.
deluxe
"Arrived quickly and very pretty! Note: velvet bag included, but NO BOX."
"Very cute. Fit great. Holds up well to washing,"
"Comfortable, eye-catching!  Color and design very western, cow-girl look.  Can be woren casually or to a dress-up affair.  Highly recommended."
"The front strap cuts a bit into my big toe joint. I am hoping it will stretch.
Am happy with the sandal for the most part but wished that Ecco had a white in the Yuccatan in my size . They always seem to run out of my size 8 - 8 1/2"
"Took off a star because my right foot heel slips and had to put in a heel grip, which is strange since my right foot is my bigger foot.  Cute, comfortable  with good arch support.  I got a 8.5M which is my usual size for enclosed toed shoes, but seem just a bit on the narrow side, which luckily for me my feet are closer to narrow than wide."
Superb. Better than. I thought
"Good fit, good quality, and very comfortable and exactly the color in the picture. I really like them!"
3x reg was too short. 3x long  is perfect
"I always wanted a Leaf design earrings or pendant so when I came across this leaf pendant especially with this wonderful low price
I went for it even though it is a bit big for me I do not like big jewelry but over all it is very lovely, well made and look like real 14K gold."
"These shoes fit and look great. Ecco sizing seems to be a bit unconventional. I'm a US 12D and the 46 fit me like a glove. Very comfortable insoles that I can walk around in all day. This is a good compromise between some dorky boat shoe and an athletic shoe. Fit and finish is really good, with quality leather uppers and consistent stitching/gluing throughout."
"It fits well and the print proved to handle the washing machine very well.  No tags on the neck area, so it's a plus if you feel discomfort on tags sweeping around your back.  I got what I expected with this shirt."
Bought these as a gift for a friend. She said they are really cute and warm!
"my daughter loves these glasses and if you want your child to be comfortable from the summer sun while also looking CQQL, get these shades!"
Perfect size for my upcoming trip.
"Love the beatuful fitting,love it."
grand son never took it off during the cruise!!!!
This is a tiny skirt. I have big thighs and this did fit well but it was too short for the look I was going for.
It's good and delivery ontime
"Used for a Halloween costume, Kentucky Derby theme, it is good quality a the right size for a man.  It could definitely be worn for everyday if you prefer bow ties."
"Nice pants, that fit well."
"I had to wear a tank under the top as the V neck is pretty open/low, but otherwise, this is a great shirt!"
"Functional wallet, holds my stuff. I thought I was getting a brown one though and got a black one. I decided I like the black one too."
Grandson loves that he can Velcro them himself.
"feels great, looks good."
"This was an amazing costume!  i received a lot of compliments and dazzled all the tricker treaters.  Thank you so much for the quick delivery too.  So very happy with the top quality of the material, definitely not one to say it was a one-time only costume.  It will definitely last a few years."
I love this bathing suit topper! I have worn it as a dress over a tank top with leggings. Very cute.
Beautiful shirt ordered xl unfortunately a us medium had to give as gift to another
Super sexy and cute I love these great pack of  six is well really well-made soft and comfy and they fit perfectly. I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.
"love, love, love these cute booties! have gotten tons of compliments on them AND they are SUPER comfortable. I loved them so much I ordered them in tan and black too!!!"
Nice material- beautifully made. Good quality.
"I just found out I'm pregnant so my review will not be at all biased because I DIDNT FIT....HaHa But it is VERY soft and comfortable, and very cute! Once I have the baby I can't wait to lose the weight to jump into this! Very excited!"
"Lightweight and comfortable, these are perfect for summertime! I got the 8"" so that they weren't too short, and that length is perfect. I'll probably purchase 2-3 more of this style in different colors."
HER birthstone dangle  spacer bead charm look very good on her arm I will buy some more for her ok
Simple ribbon for a prize for a party
My Dad really loved this set.
STILL BEAUTIFUL!! GOING TO ORDER IT AGAIN IN MY SIZE!!!!
"Love, love, love the shoes. Very comfortable, great price"
"This is the most comfortable pair of shoes I have ever owned! I am so impressed that I will be picking up more then a couple of pairs so that I will have them for years to come. I am a teacher and spend all day on my feet, these boots make my feet feel amazing even after hours in the classroom. I just which the would get the black in stock for size 13."
"As all Jag pull-ons, these fit great, but I wasn't crazy about the fuller cropped leg. I prefer the Amalia ankle jean, but that is just my personal preference."
Ive had these boots for a few months now. I absolutely love them!! I ordered my normal size and they fit perfectly. I get tons of compliments on them and I paid so little for them! Im extremely happy with this purchase!
"I got the white 2. It has a cherry blossom pattern. I Love it. It's short like a tshirt but very silky smooth like satin. My husband says it's very sexy and he loves it. My shoulders don't get cold. (I can't wear spaghetti straps) I'm going to order a few more, because my husband loves them and they are very comfortable. They don't make me feel sweaty at all in fact the material breaths very nicely and I'm comfortable all night. It doesn't stick to the bed and rolls over with me. Definitely want another one."
Does what I expect of a t-shirt.  Better made that some I have had and I will order this company's products again
Hating that I either have to dry clean or dare I say... iron?!
"I wore the sandals right out-of-the-box. I love the orange color and the style. No blisters no problems, in fact I purchased a black pair."
"Fits nice, I can throw on a pair of shorts and it walk to the beach or around my house."
Very flattering top! Nice blue
"It's very large and heavy, very thick material. I should have ordered one size smaller compared to most other clothing/brands. It is not soft, but it is quite absorbent."
"Good product, great price. Keeps my sunglasses from becoming part of the river when the canoe overturns! Live Life Large."
"The bag seems solidly built. I carry college materials in it so nothing super heavy.
The things i don't like are its a little floppier than i was hoping for, so it won't sit up on its own in say a chair or at your feet.
The velcro on the lid came unstitched on one side,  after about a month so i had to make a repair.
Other than that its nice enough."
I usually wear a 10.5 and the 10 fit perfect! Super comfortable and cute! Would definitely recommend and buy again.
Work great for my just turned 5yo son. He's 38.5lbs and about 44inches tall. These will last him until he's 6 for sure.
Radiant white gems that are well shaped and strung. A little short on the neckline. Lobster clasp is fair quality but not too flimsy.
I have sensitive ears and these are perfect!
All around great briefs.
These are by far the best socks ever made. Nothing is better. Period.
"This is very cute. It's a decent size, but you have to look a little closely to make out the mother and child. From a distance it's a sort of stylized heart shape, so if you're not into jewelry in concrete shapes, this might still work for you. I thought the 18"" chain might be a little short, but it's just right.

As with other Amazon pendants, the clasp can be a little tricky, but that's not a huge deal."
Wanted an inexpensive watch that was easy to read.  The white on black contrast does that perfectly.  Keeps time just fine.  I also like the size of the day and date indicators and the adjustable bezel ring for timing.  It's a keeper.
"i wish if they had moore color options like tan color so as to buy another one , also i wish if the front where wider , but still good as is"
Love these! Very nice material. It feels strong (not cheap) but also very comfortable. Fit nicely. A tiny bit longer than expected but I love the way I look in them! Arrived super fast too! A lot sooner than expected.
"Super big bag, fits my coat. Great quality"
Love Wallflower jeans
Gotta love simple slip ons.
"You don't feel the shoes, is so light. I don't know why i hesitated to buy it before. Buying a few more for sure"
"I have looked for sandal I can wear to work for casual days and walk-in comfortably. These are great. I am not an outdoorsy person, I'm not hiking but am walking through art fairs & on my feet at festivals. I ordered a half-size down based on reviews. The toe strap is not really loose but I can wiggle my toes; definitely not meant to strap tightly to the sandal. Ankle strap is easily adjustable and simple. I love the arch support."
"Does its job well. Matches my car's interior perfectly. Natural look, feel. Tan, green trim. Opens to store small ID, papers, coin, etc. I love mine."
"I've had a lot of compliments on this wallet, which I bought in red faux alligator.  I enjoy the convenience of an outer compartment for credit cards and drivers license."
They fit okay for my size 12 feet. I like the cushioned bottom and the over the calf part feels a bit like a compression sleeve. Not bad at all
Love these.. so cute & comfy!! I usually wear a size 8 shoe but I ordered a 9 as other reviewers suggested & it's the right choice.. the furry lining inside takes up space so sizing up 1 size is important. Very good quality slipper & cute for running outside to get the paper or even for morning carpool
"Got these to work in. No steel toes which is nice, as I have sensitive feet. Oil slip resistant is a must for my shop and these have slip-resistant soles. Also well put together.
And most of all...comfortable!"
"Ok, it is kind of bulky compared to the past wallet I've owned over the past decade but this looks fabulous and feels great! Has more than enough slips for your credit cards and other personals. Bought this primarily for the color and the ID holder, the extra goodies are great too."
These are perfect for my husband who can't find this style of socks in his size at stores. they are good quality and very soft.
"I bought this to wear gardening, and it works really well.  Keeps the sun off my face and neck, yet is a breathable fabric that doesn't make my head too hot.  I especially like the tie, as it keeps the wind from blowing it off.  It fits a little snugly, but that's better than too loose.  Will probably loosen up over time."
"Have had back problems and just haven't been able to wear heels in comfort.  Since I wear dresses to work, I needed something sometimes dressier than a flat. These fit the bill pretty well and, while the cut of the shoe in the picture looks a little old-fashioned, it is a more modern cut, shows a little toe cleavage :-).  The only reason I didn't give these 5 stars is because the break in period was almost two weeks!"
I love this vest!  Fits
Much better than expected!! So beautiful!
Never knew that our body shifts as we age! Was never old before. Ordered 4 bras all wrong sizes. I'll get it right eventually may next order. Donated the primo us bras.
"Great shirt, fit is spot on except for the neck, which is way off. It is labeled the same as all my other dress shirts, but the neck is huge. When buttoned up, there is a gap of about 3-4 inches between my neck and the shirt. It's not possible to wear a tie with the shirt.  Otherwise everything else fits perfectly."
Love this bag. Super cute! I keep getting complements about it everywhere I go.
Great for school uniforms and fits perfectly.
This is my third pair of this style.  I wore a pair on my Vegas vacation and walked over 40 miles in 5 days.  No blisters or discomfort.
"My kids lived in these for our week-long vacation to Roatan!  I bought a small set for my 1-year old and XL for my 3-year old.  They have a cotton pad as the sole, kind of like a towel to make it more comfortable.  We would toss them in the drier so they could put them on dry instead of wet because they didn't dry that quickly, granted it was hot and humid where we were and we wore them a lot.  My son liked them for walking on the hot sand and some of the rocky areas of the beach.  No complaints!"
Bought (6/9) for my nephew who is a husky 3 month old they are perfect great quality shirts. He will get many wears out of them. The colors are great too I will definitely buy more in the future once my Lil one arrives
Great wallet and even better was the price. Are you kidding me? I got this for under $11.00. Beautifully made. Nice tight pockets to hold cards etc. really like the Tri fold design. Easily worth 3 times the price.
"Really great purchase! The tights are high quality, great colors, and the price can't be beat. Highly recommended!"
"just as the picture shows.  Just takes FOREVER to receive it.  I forgot I had even ordered it...but to be fair, it did come from overseas....however, great hat, I ordered another one for a friend."
Very cute and stylish! Cute hard case as well!
Perfect! Very slimming!
Best socks for business casual... great bang for the buck... Not my first purchase of these and not my last...
"It's almost summer! That means that it truly is sandal time!  These sandals fit true to size. I wear a size 7 and I have really high arches. A size 7 in these sandals fits me perfectly. They are comfortable. I love the way they fit. I love the way my high arches feel in these comfy flip flops.

So...this is a great sandal to wear around the house or at the beach or at the pool."
aaaa++++
A little large but it's a great blouse
"My girls enjoy their cowgirl hats.  They are build well, and the lights are fun."
"Basic set of socks an nice range of colors.

 Fit is OK but Im not sure how you would go at the larger ends of the scale. Not real thick but they are not designed to be and come in a really small box which makes you wonder how they can get six sets of socks in there until you see how small they are.

 They stretch OK but are less stretchy than regular socks in my opinion which means you have to put them on the right way otherwise they won't fit. Still, they fit so little to complain about - Ill update if any issues after a wash.

 Product provided for review - its just my opinion."
"one year in and these have held together nicely, only complaint is that they are not super flexible in the ankle area, makes walking up and down hills uncomfortable."
My second pair of David Tate boots.  They are especially perfect because of the low heel height...  easy to walk in all day.  I ordered a half size up because reviews said they were narrow in the toe area....excellent fit and I can wear a heavier weight sock if needed.  A great boot!
"i  am addicted to fit flops for comfort !!!... have many pair and always happy with the, !!!  have not been able to wear these yet, as  the cooler temps have kept me waiting !.....  been wearing my gogh navy blue clogs daily !!!"
Love it. Very comfortable. Washes well.
Got this for my mother for mother's day and she loved it!! She loved the color and the design. I think it was a perfect gift for mothers day but if you were to get this for your wife or SO they would love it too. The crystals make it look even better and very elegant. The watch does not look cheap and the materials feel like its good quality. Very happy that my mother loved her gift.
"Soft, well proportioned. No complaints here. I will likely buy more."
"I got these for my 8 yr old daughter. She normally wears a 2 in most sneakers right now so I decided to go a size up, in case they ran small, and also to maybe get a few years out of them. I do think they are true to size and she does have extra room in the toes, which is fine, and she seems to like them and says they are comfortable. They have an inner lining from top to bottom which I like, I think this helps keep feet warm. They are also very cute with the fur trim however with her snow pants over it you don't really see it."
"I love this Switzerland/Bohemian Attractive Summer Soft Scarf! I received the blue colored scarf. Upon arrival, it has this excess thread that came off so I just cut that off. The material quality is good. I like it that it's not thick. It has a soft and smooth texture as well. The length is long enough to tie it in different styles how to wear it. This has become one of my favorite scarfs to wear!
***I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review."
"The quality of the product was excellent.  The mala was properly packed.  The quality of the beads was excellent.  I will recommend this seller.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/7mm-Natural-Colorful-Crystal-Quartz-Beads-Buddhist-Prayer-Mala-Necklace-Bracelet/dp/B014IIIWC2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">7mm Natural Colorful Crystal Quartz Beads Buddhist Prayer Mala Necklace Bracelet</a>"
The best boxers you can find for this very reasonable price. There are no other Kinds:)
"l love this case. Before I had this, all my earring were in a jumbled mess!"
very nice I love saucony and a very nice price.
Great way to extend the time I can wear flip flops. These are very thin which is what I wanted.
This necklace will get compliments wherever it goes. It looks like a cool and possibly pricey antique necklace unless you really examine it closely. Wears beautifully with other bronze jewelry.
Just received this - so I can't say how long it'll work - but it fits nicely (it's adjustable) and looks cute.
Super fast shipping and the quality of the product was great. Nice bright colors. I got it for a 2 year old so he could grow into it.
"Soft Style Alesia gets 4 stars even though I'm returning it, because the style is so cute- pointed but not-too-pointy, with a kitten heel, this is a classic, vintage looking shoe. The construction is decent, especially for the price. The size (I'm a WW, difficult to fit) was exactly right, and though there was something strange about the toe bed shape for my particular foot, these would be pretty comfortable. But the ""nude cloud patent"" color is hideous. It looks so much more pearl in the photos, in person it is super shiny peach. Perhaps for a person with a light peaches-and-cream skin tone this would work, but not for my olive tone. These are going back, but I would order this brand again, and specifically consider this very shoe in a different color."
"Just what I needed, I needed tall fli flops so I could be comfortable on my wedding day, if my feet hurt with my formal heels.
Theese work perfect, and I didn't step on my dress."
"I love these pants, They are made great. I wear a size 14 and I ordered a 14, fits fo good. I am buying a couple of more."
I really liked these and my granddaughter liked them so much they're now hers.  Got me another pair.
"Fantastic solution for my bras, until they stretch more. No suffering to dress them anymore."
"This outfit is super cute! The material is stretchy and fits comfortably. For reference, I'm 5'6"", 135lbs and it's just right."
They just shoe laces  but  excellent  price for 2 pair's
"I measured my daughter and ordered according to her measurements. These pants required belt because they're too big. Wish I had returned them however she wore them and they got dirty, there for I have to keep them. They are nice looking and great quality that's why I steel braided it four stars. Sizing chart needs to be corrected."
"Great, affordable cardigan. Looks real classy on and fits perfectly. I knocked off a star because the clasp is plastic instead of wood. I wear this one more than any I have in my closet"
"Nice product, warm fleece like lining. I'm 5 foot 1 inch 115 pounds and I ordered a small. Fit me very well."
"My husband loves these sunglasses! They cover his glasses adequately without looking like a giant fly. He wears while driving, biking or jogging."
"I am wearing these for the first time today. Because I have very high arches, the foot bed doesn't quite work for me; however, this is a pretty common problem so I don't dock any points there. Otherwise, these shoes seem quite comfortable. I am a true size 7, and while these shoes fit I am normally used to a bit more room in the back. Not too small, but if you are between sizes, I would opt for a half size up. Also to note are that the back and side straps. These are Velcro closures. I was not expecting this, but it makes for an easy adjustment and for slipping the shoes off. Finally, I will mention the color. I bought the red. However, when I received them, they are more of a deep coral, with a tinge of orange. I actually like the color better than the picture, but please be aware that the red is not a true stop sign red. I would recommend to anybody!"
Very comfortable and stylish. I really love this shoes.
I ordered these in tortoise but they are a little darker than expected. Still very cute. They're a little loose but can easily be adjusted. I am totally in love with these
"I always has a good experience with Clark's shoes. Soft, comfortable, It does not matter if you wear for hours."
Durable and great for my commute to work everyday!
"This is a very wide, warm and long scarf to have.  This is what to have during the cold winter and it is great to wear."
"Using for kayaking, very comfortable!"
Boyfriend liked them
Very happy with socks.
Great color. Just as described.
"I got it in a variety of colors for playing tennis and they're great for that, go perfectly with colorful sports bras. Light, breezy and they make you look super cool ;-)"
"It was a little big for me, but I like it."
"They seem to be well made, but i have to admit i thought they would be a little larger. Will be a tight squeeze for items!"
"This particular style of shoe is hard to come by, so I was thrilled to see it on sale at Amazon.  It is one of the most comfortable and long-wearing shoes I have owned; I have it in black as well. I like that is has a low heel and a simple design."
This skirt is very well made! I was pleasantly surprised. If you plan on wearing it at your waist the skirt was well past my knees but I plan to wear the skirt pulled up a little above the mid drift with a crop top ^_^ LOVE it. Great purchase for the price (I purchased a large im 5'0 160)
"Seriously great value! I've worn the hat, paws, and leg warmers several times already and they hold up great. I was really surprised by the quality of the outfit. Haven't worn the skirt and corset out yet, but I tried them on and they fit. I'm 5'6, 135lbs with a D cup. The costume does shed a lot so be aware of that."
My son out-grew the boiler room suit
Reliable Slack.
I just just a sweatshirt
fit as expected and look exactly as the picture shows.
Such a beautiful color!  Incredibly comfortable although somewhat short...hits a little above the ankle.
Fit very well. 5'3 size 12. Slenderizing.
"The fabric seems a bit different than my other Toms, but they're good!!"
My husband wears it everyday. It was perfect
Gorgeous! Excellent quality
These are definitely good for someone with very big calves like I have. I would like to order more in some other colors.
"I like it, although not as thick as material as my previous sweatshirt."
"This has and still is providing a great service for me. Excellent piece of leather, craftsmanship and very comfortable to wear for long periods of time."
The quality of the ring surprised me since it looks well made and very classy. I enjoyed how lightweight it was and I am sure to get many compliments with it on.
"This was a gift for a friend. She loved  it!! Good quality and graphics. I would definitely purchase from this company again. Also, very quick delivery!"
"Great shoes , very comfortable.  I will order more from them."
I love these socks! Loved the cross one's super cute!
Awesome socks don't ride down and be in shoes
Gorgeous and so comfy!!
Pimpin in my Boat shoes. No body can match the swag. Got to get for any shoe professional. Get women
Very practical size and weight and the omega clasp is a big plus!
"My Great Granddaughter loves her new OshKosh B'Gosh slip ons, they are very ""comfy"" and the perfect color for many of her outfits!!!"
"color was a little strange; more grayish than a definite black and white, but keeping it."
"Reviewed by my wife: I have several Dermablend products: the ""CoverCreme"" in several colors; the ""Liquid Camo Medium Coverage Foundation""; the ""INTENSE PowderCamo"". I got them for my daughter to use for stage makeup (she has been doing character makeup for a small Shakespeare troupe in our county). It works amazingly!

This high-coverage liquid foundation is smooth, easy to apply and gives complete coverage with just a very, very tiny amount. It dispenses from a tube and gives a nice satiney finish. It has an almost undetectable fragrance, and produces no irritation on my very sensitive skin. Truly excellent product."
"This is the third pair of these shoes I have purchased.  They are so comfortable!  I bought the first pair for work because of the steel toe, but once I tired them on and felt how comfortable they are, I wear them even when I am not at work."
Love them!! Very comfortable!
I have gotten a million compliments on this watch in just a week!  Super comfortable and beautifully done.  The rose gold with the white is perfect together!
"TOMS does not need to explain , Just wear it."
Shoes are nice but it's a bit too wide and I normally wear wide shoes
Nice suit well made  I swim daily so they get much use
"perfect fit, very comfortable to walk."
Love it!  Wearing them now!  I have a small farm and this is what I needed!!
"I don't like gladiator shoes, but I fell in love with these!"
"I bought these crocs in the size that I bought other crocs - these, however, do not have an adjustable heel-strap, so they feel a bit too large. I'm returning them for a size smaller and I look forward to wearing them."
Top notch socks with high vis colors.
"I have enjoyed running my longer runs in my trance.  I prefer lighter weight shoes for speed workouts, and even lighter shoes for races.  But, these shoes have good support (for mild over pronation) without having too rigid of a forefoot.  Despite the heel to toe drop, I naturally mid-foot strike in them.  I wish Brooks hadn't discontinued this line.  I'm now on a search for my new favorite training show."
"Beautiful dress, great fit!"
Comfortable shoes for kids!
"I wasn't sure if I would like these earrings but they're much nicer than I thought.  Very fashionable and trendy.  I was just speaking with someone the other day who was wearing a pair when these arrived.  They're not overly large but just right.  I especially like the extra detail of the decorative rib on either side of the ball.  The ball is free to spin and catches the light in a pleasant way.  Overall, a great product at a good price."
"I love these shoes!  They are very well made, comfortable and the fit is great!  I was able to walk in them all day long!"
"I don't know where this review will end up seeing as so many of these hats have slightly different pictures or sellers with varying prices, but trust the picture of the hot Japanese lady wearing the hat(brown hair, orange shirt). Gotta admit, it looks exactly as you will expect it, like the picture but rolled up tightly in a bag. Mine was shipped basically wrapped in a plastic sheet(not a real bag), then put inside a cheap gray plastic bag(sealed), and finally in another gray bag with shipping labels. Not too bad seeing as it was a cheap price and amazingly well made. It's a lot like the 2 years later Law Hat in that its not a regular hat but something you kind of put on your head and then pull down till it stays on. It might slip of for people with larger heads, if you walk a lot in it. Still it is incredibly nice.
This is one of the good instances were the picture does not lie, if you are looking at the right picture. I still prefer my pre time-skip chopper hat over this one since that one was bigger, but having them side by side is too cool!"
"I was disappointed in the width of these very nice, very wide shoes. They just didn't work for my super wide feet. I was surprised that the 3EEE didn't work for me..big surprise . My header is wrong...I am not happy these shoes did not fit me."
"Love them.  I was looking for a very small earring since I rarely take them out. I have had other small hoop earrings but I especially like these because they are a bit wider and you can actually see them as opposed to a very thin wire. Not gonna lie, they are difficult to get in. It's not something you would want to do on a daily basis, but if you are like me and keep your earrings in for an extended period, I would recommend these."
"I love these work pants.  They fit as expected.  They are a good mid-weight - not too heavy or rigid, but still tough and good for year round wear.  Pretty darn durable as well.  I bought my first pair of these on Amazon a little over a year ago.  I wear them quite frequently for work, and they have held up great. Dickies are usually a great value, but I have had issues in the past finding the right size with some Dickies styles -which is incidentally my biggest complaint about Dickies, overall.  There seems to be no consistency from style to style (or even sometimes with differing colors of the same style) regarding sizing and fit for Dickies pants.  The styles of Dickies that Walmart carries seem to run about a size and a half too small.  I typically wear 34x30, and I couldn't button the Wal-Mart Dickies in that size with a pair of vice grips.  However, the 36x30 in the same style are way too baggy for me.  I also had the same problem with the first pair of Dickies I tried from Amazon - https://smile.amazon.com/Dickies-Mens-Relaxed-Duck-34x30/dp/B000PSVEUW/ref=sr_1_1?s=apparel&ie=UTF8&qid=1490228952&sr=1-1&nodeID=7147441011&psd=1&keywords=Dickies%2BMen's%2BRelaxed%2BFit%2BDuck%2BJean%2C%2BMoss%2C%2B34x30&th=1&psc=1.  Luckily, I found these that actually do fit, and I have been extremely pleased."
"Ordered for my new job in a factory, these are nice! The soles are comfortable, and they're very sturdy. Be warned, the material is very thick and don't breath at all. Your feet are going to sweat, even on cooler days. I've worn them in 50 degree F weather, and on days when the factory is 90 F on the inside (I live in MI, weather has mood swings like a teenager). Thin or thick socks, you will sweat. Invest in Dr. Scholls shoe spray."
"I bought these for a five day canoe trip. This trip involved canoeing, hiking, and swimming. These shoes were perfect! They are very comfortable, durable, and lightweight. They dry out quickly. The sole on the bottom is thick and grippy, so I had no problem walking over slippery rocks or through the woods. These shoes also look very fashionable, and I had the best dressed feet out of everyone in my group!"
Love this set! Wore it with a dress I bought on Amazon for New Years Eve and it matched the dress spot on! Lots of compliment on it and the dress!
So dope!! Nod to the 80's....
I have worn these shoes many times now and find I reach for them more often than I thought I would.  It took a few wears to settle into the foot bed but once I figured out to adjust the strap over the top of the foot the fit was much better.  I also bought this shoe in white for summer and wear those with all things white.  Would recommend them.  True to size.
"Really cute, I use it as my pinkie ring."
"Super cute! Definitely not for support but just an easy, light thing to wear when I'm hanging around the house with a t-shirt... not wanting a full bra."
Bought these for my boyfriend and I love when he wears them!
Nice  dress. Quick delivery
This shirt is very soft.  It's one of my favorites to wear when lounging because of that.  I bought the shirt for a pirates shirt day.  I don't think this is what they had in mind.  I find it hilarious.
"I have to say this dress was a last ditch effort to find a dress for my cousins wedding... AND IT IS BEAUTIFUL! I am 5'3, 125 lbs and normally order a small or size 4 for dresses. After reading the comments, I actually went up to a Medium because everyone was saying that it is a little snug. Especially if you have a little junk in the trunk like I do, it is wise to order a size up. Even with going up a size, the dress fit absolutely perfect and I got many compliments!
I highly recommend this dress and ordering a size up with purchase."
"They are shoes, they fit, they didn't bite"
"Looks very cute on my daughter. Thicker, heavy material that is somewhat ichy so prepare to wear something under it."
"I WEAR A 9 1/2 AND GOT A 10.  A LITTLE SMALLER THAN I THOUGHT. BUT I HEAR THE STRETCH AND JUST A NOTE, THEY ARE STILL A VERY NICE 5 STAR SUMMER SHOE.  MADE WONDERFUL AND SO COMFORTABLE AND LIGHT !"
I ordered a size up because of some of the reviews but I wish I hadnt. These shoes are cute and comfortable.
"This necklace looks much nicer in person. It sparkles, and the details are small and delicate. In the photo, it looks large and bulky, but in person it is a fine detailed necklace that looks very pretty. The sterling silver links on the chain are small and shine next to the ultra shiny gemstones. The 18 inch chain size is a nice size, for a small neck, but the 20 inch would hang lower. This necklace arrived in a hinged box that slid out of another jewelry box. Overall, this necklace is very nice!"
I owned an eco-drive watch a few years ago  and it was either lost or stolen. I suppose I will never know which. This is a very attractive watch. I also love the fact that I never have to buy batteries for it. I own a Tag watch and have to send it out to get the battery changed. That is expensive and a pain!
"Wonderful price; great quality.  I'm not a big fan of the plastic forefoot sole- I think it is supposed to resemble the old leather soles.  Love the laces and leather grain.  The actual color is lighter than the picture shoes, unless you neutral polish them every day.  For the price and quality, I will probably get a black pair as well.  The foot support is the best that I've had (no flat footbed here) outside a hiking boot.  For those of you who don't like things hitting high-ankle, this shoe is not for you though; it has little to no cushioning there to lessen the contact."
"I bought one of these beanies a few weeks ago for my husband to match his hoodie. Needless to say our 12 year old was very envious so I bought him his own as a reward for a full day of spring yard work ;) Great quality, great price and it shows our military pride as a military family."
Good shoes. Good price. Can make a shoe wardrobe buying at these prices. Need a dress shoe / boot with 10 eyelets if you can suggest any
This is the most beautiful umbrella  I like the colors and really protect from the water
Was perfect for my stay in the hospital. Nice that it has a handle and wheels.
"These are so cute & comfortable. A lil wide but, I put some gel insoles inside & the fit
is perfect now. I love this espadrille -sneaker look."
Fit AMAZING! Right amount of support when going to the gym or not going to the gym.
I was afraid this watch was going to be too big and bulky. It's not and I only have a 6-inch wrist. Looks Super Fly and I just love it. It will be my go-to casual watch for the rest of the summer.
nice coatcomfort onebut size is smaller than expected
Great price! Greta necklace!
I'm talking about the waist band not the trunk itself.  I typically wear X-Large in most briefs but these are loose at the waist band.
gift for my niece's baby. seems to like it.
"My bust is 37, chest, 33, waist 35, and hip 42. I purchased the blazer in size 12, which is normally a size large on me with most brands. To be honest, Ive always wanted a blazer and as  this being my first one ever, Im really impressed and am absolutely in love with! Its really cute and fashionable and looks good casually with jeans or classy with dress pants or a skirt. This also makes a cute transition piece for warmer to colder seasons, as the material is lightweight. This is something particularly important to me because I get really uncomfortable in heavier clothes. The shoulders aren't too small or too large, but fit me just right. I also really enjoy the little zippers on the side as well as the draped open front. This blazer is adorable and Im very happy with it overall!"
"Great fit ,style and material . Fits true to six and is the perfect length or a 6 ft man"
4 1/2 stars. This suit is very pretty. The colors pop and it has a flattering fit. I have a large middle but feel the suit looks good and is very comfortable. I wish there were more support in the chest area. It has those little foam things that slide around and fold over inside it instead of a sturdy built in bra. T
Super cute! Covers the right areas perfectly. Great fit
I Already have one in khaki green and love it! This one in ivory will go with everything i have.
"B'day gift for my wife fulfilled her wish for bamboo flannel PJ's.  At last.  Warm and soft, Well made and comfortable. Color bright, true to online photo.  She loves them.  Quick service. She's 5'2"" and petite, and small was commodious.  Recommended."
she loves this great outfit
"I went by the reviews when deciding what size to buy.  I wear a 7-1/2 normally, so I sized up to an 8.  I should have gone down to a 7.  They were pretty roomy at the top, like they were made for a more buxome foot. I have a pretty high arch, and they gave great arch support.  The only thing I really wasn't crazy about was that the criss-cross straps just seemed like they were too long, and didn't fit snugly against my foot, if that makes any sense.  I would buy them again, just in a smaller size."
"I have had for about a month now... I like the purse it is big so a lot if things fit in it.. Too much maybe :-) it has held up well so far the only complaint I have is it is not a bright pink as shown... The pink is much more muted, if your expecting a Bright punk purse that is not the case it is more like a dull Barbie pink. Other then that I would reccomend."
Great summer weight T shirt. Tall stays tucked in and I like having a pocket.
Awesome coat!!!!
My boyfriend loved this shirt and happy we bought it.
"I like this 3 sided flower bead.  It looks lovely on my bracelet and also a good fit for my fantasy type necklace.

I like the splash of gold, too.  Since it is 3 sided, as it turns on the bracelet, you can always see the face of the bead.

It is large enough to make a statement, when placed in the middle, but small enough to use as a spacer bead anywhere on the bracelet or necklace.

I recommed it !"
"This mask is surprisingly well made with some heft to it and the light up eyes and talking Spidey voice make it a lot of fun for the Grandkid.  He was running around for hours and sticking his face in every adult's he could find.  I wouldn't give it much for educational value, but that's not the point, the point is the kid can put it on his face and immerse himself for however long in 'being' Spidey!!  That's what it was all about when I was a kid and we'd get a cloth mask and a broomstick and Dad's hat and spend hours as The Lone Ranger! What Fun!  The fact that they took the time to make it right (sturdy and not flimsy) with replaceable double A batteries that can be exchanged easily speaks well of Marvel's licensing guys.  It'll last awhile and probably get passed on.  Say that about new toys today!"
My son loves his shoes and they're easy to put on.  Very stylish looking and comfortable.  Great deal and I got these on sale under $25.
I'm sorry I drifted away Keen. I tried other urban hiking shoes and sneakers but nothing matched the support and comfort of my Keens.
I am a size 8.5 and I was a little concerned about the size I would be buying. I bought a nine afraid it would be too big. NOPE. These are the best fitting shoes I have ever worn. I go into my workday looking forward to arriving home and slipping these on!
looooove them
A great light weight coat that is well constructed. I am happy with my purchase.
"I like these glasses so much that this is the second pair I've bought.  They are light, look good, and go a great job of blocking the sun.  Highly recommend!"
"This charm necklace was even prettier than I thought it would be. I ordered the blue stone version and I love it! I really like the heart design of a heart within a heart.  The charm isn't large but small and cute for anyone to wear from young to old.  The chain seems to be fragile and might not take a lot of stress so it may not be suitable for children that may tug on it.
I have trouble with my fingers so the lobster claw clasp makes it easier for me to put the necklace on myself.  This necklace is versatile so can be worn with any outfit on any occasion or no occasion.  The box this necklace came in is very cute and sturdy.
I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
NICE N SLIM
I got these as a gift for my son and he loves them. They are really warm and comfortable and seem to be wearing well.
"I think this hat is so elegant. It was the perfect accessory for me as I have natural hair and cannot place my hair inside a traditional hat. The removable top is a great feature and the tied bow in the back was the perfect dainty and ladylike accent. I am also a big fan of the colors and could see this being a great accessory for a tea party or derby day.

A little larger than expected.... But very nice!
This wig really made my costume complete. It was a bit of a fix to wear while driving the car. :)
"We are becoming loyal Pediped Customers, and this lived up our expectations."
Perfect shorts for summer at the beach!
Fit perfectly. Love these shirts by Dickies.
"Update:
Washed in hot water (to bleed out the red) and dried in low heat, shrunk to a much more snug fit than out of the bag. Not used to having to shrink cloth.

Original:
For the price, it's not bad. I got it to wear at work, generic fit, bit wider than I like. Comparison photo has Obey lofty creature comfort crew in grey vs the Hanes in red."
This is our second time buying these shoes because they are true to size and fit my son great.  Awesome support and traction.
Nice gloves. Very soft and warm. Exactly how they are described and fit well
"The shirt was very adorable, although you can see the clip on the tie a bit too much which can get annoying. The size was a larger 7 than the one we expected. Had to return it :/"
"My husband loves these!! In ordered 2 and he told me to order more! Fits great and sturdy material. He's always been a Savane user,  but these seem better quality than the usual ones he's ordered in the past."
Great pants. So comfy and no bulky zipper. I ordered my normal size and they fit perfectly. Couldn't ask for better.
"Love these shoes.  I didn't have a loafer until ordering this shoe.  I wanted to expand my shoe variety and since I didn't have a loafer yet, I looked for a Cole Haan loafer because I've had good luck with my other Cole Haan shoes.  These shoes are incredibly comfortable!  So easy to wear all day, yet still professional enough to wear to the office with a suit or some nice slacks.  They resist creasing quite well.  Overall, these are awesome!"
Good socks. As expected.
"Well put together, and looks good in person."
"my boyfriend is 6'2"", 275 lbs, and these are by far the best skinny jeans we have found for him (we get 38x34)! i have ordered them in three different colors for him and he loves each pair!"
Absolutely love them! Just what was expected. Very comfortable with socks. Fit like a glove and easy to slide your foot in which is a plus!!
She's crazy about the movie and loved the slicker.
I am very happy with this watch. I really like that it has military time. I only wish that it was illuminated.
I always buy ascis shoes. This pair of ascis were a gift for my mother. She loved it! I suggest to order 1 size more than you usually order.
"Super affordable, soft and stylish ... I ordered one in black and another in a slate gray. Will be ordering more for hubs for sure. Someone even asked him where be purchased/brand of this tee. He hates pocket tees and plain stylish non-snug shirts aren't easy to find lately. Great value!"
Pleasantly surprised by how much I love these shoes. The color seems like it will go with everything and the shoe fits just right and is really comfortable for a heel. I am a size 8 and the size 8 fit me great.
"very good, I love it. Size is also appropriate."
"I am super happy with this dress!!! Ordering from Amazon when you are on the chunky side can be a challenge as clothes seem to never fit right. I took a shot needing a dress for a wedding (and wore it for Easter too) and figured for the price - it was worth trying. I was so pleased with how comfortable this dress is! The fabric has a little stretch to it and it just makes me feel pretty!
I am 5'3"" and 180 pounds. I carry a lot of my weight in the stomach. I ordered an XL and it fit great!

I do not have any full length pictures but I do have one with my daughter that shows I do not look bad in it. I love the print also!
If you are on the fence with this dress and it is the shape that looks good on your body type - I highly suggest you go ahead and get it!"
I received on time and the shoes were exactly what i expected.  They fit perfectly and I've worn them everyday since.
"Beautiful boot, but the fit is not right for me.  Normally, I wear a 9, but the 9 pressed on my toes so I ordered a 9.5.  The heel was way too big and I could not keep it from slipping so back they went."
"Love these shoes, i would order again, thankyou !!!!!!!"
Great product for the price I paid.  Well constructed.  Great polarization.  Super value.
"My wife saw this dress and fell immediately in love with it, to which I proceeded to purchase it for her, and after seeing her in it I must say I love it too.  Good quality material, not scratchy; her words not mine, however I couldn't keep my hands off her so I say it felt pretty good as well!"
"I wantes ths bag to 'work' so much because it is a super design and so soft and pretty.  Great color.  But, alas, too internally small for what I needed.  So I sent it back, I'm sorry to say.  Wish Latico made it in 11"" or 12"" wide and another couple of inches, spacewise  Also, the ad on Amazon says 'made in the US"" - maybe the sign in but on another website, the same bag is made in India."
A bit on the large end of my tolerance at 47 mm it wears very well. Fairly easy to set up and looks great.
Sweater is as advertised
"These are some pretty comfortable shirts. They're not life changing or going to make me a die hard Hanes fan, but they're some fine, good looking, and comfortable shirts. That's all I ask for anyway."
I got these for my son.  They didn't shrink at all when washed and they seem thick and sturdy.  He wears them for work.  They seem true to size.
Great suspenders! Highly recommended.
"It is my 3rd purchase of that bra, like it a lot"
Got these for my almost 3 yr old daughter. They fit perfectly and she loves wearing them. Cute design too.
"Super soft for this type of shoe, meets all expectations and did a very good investment"
These come to the knee.best sock ever.
My sister is 66 yrs young & is crazy over owls. these are for all ages!. Soooo darling & well made.
Just as described.  Would do business with again.  Very happy with product.
Nice jean for running around and casual nights out!
Great quality material. Fits to size. Washed well. I buy several colors because they are my go to for quick sweater when the weather is chilly but not cold.
"This bracelet is very pretty. It is just the right size, and adjustable. I have found it to be very comfortable, and goes with just about everything. The only negative I have with it, is that the end caps had sharp spots on them where they connected with the bracelet. I gently filed them down, and now it's all set!"
Great price. Lasted multiple summers. Three years later and I'm buying the same ones.
Well constructed.  Very large but with belt easy to pull up.  Quite warm so may not be suitable in a very warm climate.  I have washed it several times and goes through the wash well.
WORKS LIKE EVERY OTHER BELT I WEAR TO KEEP MY PANTS AND SHORTS IN PLACE.
Item received as expected. I would recommend and order from this merchant again.
Super cute and holds up well in the water and to washing. They fit my son great. Will absolutely buy again!
Bought these for my daughter for her homecoming event and they fit great looked beautiful with her amazing dress. She wore them all night with no complaints and the next morning her feet were not sore. Great classy heels.
Many compliments! It was rainy that day and the shoes just took a nice wipe down with a paper towel and they were good to go for the rest of the day! Brilliant!
It took a bit to figure out how to use the tags since I have never used them before and there are no instructions. They are very sturdy and worked well.
"I went to my first EDM show in the summer and wore this. Everybody in the crowd loved it! I highly recommend it. If you don't have a B cup or C then I wouldn't recommend it. I put the battery pack inside under my breast (not the most comfortable but you'll get over it) so it would be hidden. An A cup wouldn't fake it and a D cup would hurt having that remote stuck in there. But again, awesome buy."
I love this bracelet. It is very versatile. I wear it alone and with other bracelet. Has a magnetic closure so it stays put.
I like this sweater but it stretches out very quickly after a few hours of wear.  Regardless of this it is still a very nice sweater and the price was even nicer.
Wonderful earrings . Very nice size and not real heavy. I highly recommended.
Beautiful dress1
"I was concerned by the description how bright this tie would be. I would not describe it as neon at all. It is a nice bright yellow color and in person, looks close to the color in the pic"
"I normally don't buy shoes that have this much stack height since I need to feel the road to be happy.  I want the true barefoot experience in my shoes, and the Vapor Glove is the only Merrell that fits that definition for me right now.  However, I'm having some problems with one knee, and the physical therapist urged me to get a shoe with more structure and arch support.  I'm happy to say that this shoe pleases the p.t. without compromising too much on comfort.  A stack height between this shoe and the Vapor Glove would be fantastic, but after trying lots of shoes this one seems to be the least bothersome, and the heel rise is doable.  The arch isn't even too intrusive, and the padding on the heel and tongue is okay, comfy without pushing my foot in odd directions.

That said, I love the looks of this shoe!  I have the Blue Depths, and the combination of greens and blues, with a touch of hot pink is perfect.  Nothing boring here!  I still think barefoot is healthier for your feet, but if you want or need a little more padding and arch, this shoe is for you.  I'm giving it four stars instead of five for my own quirky reasons - I just want less shoe."
I knew this shoe would be perfect for me.  I was not disappointed.  It feels great. I would recommend it highly.
"Quality is great, pads are a little awkward. I removed mine and it was just as great. I only recommend that if you are a woman with a large busy but a smaller frame you should go down a size. I wear a DDD but the XL was still a bit too big. Still able to wear comfortably under my maxi dress."
Shirts are very nice quality soft and very comfortable. Very pleased with purchase
"The shoes fit perfectly!
I am a first time buyer to this brand. Comfortable just like putting my feet into patted or cushion like sneakers.
Usually in the store you can look on the in side of a shoe and see the size. So normally I would see the half sizes printed 9 1/2 for my size.
But on line the sizes for me are 9.5 D(M) US and that was a good guess on my part. Maybe the sellers can explain what the M,D and E stand for, because it clears the doubt for those aren't familiar with these letters. Which might bring in a lot more sales with people having to know rather than not be sure."
Comfy socks. Looks just like the picture.
I'm in love with this necklace. It is the going fashion for my summer clothes. reece@roadrunner.com. I ordered it in two of the colors and will order more for gifts. Not to heavy and well made.
I ordered extra large because other reviews said it ran small. Should have just got the large it doesn't run small. I gave it to my Mom and she loved it. Very cute and a nice tailored fit!
"For the price, these are good sunglasses.
But you ultimately do get what you paid for.
The glasses, the case, the microfiber cloth, all have a very chemical, rubber smell that is a bit off putting. I expected it to go away after a day or so, but I've had the glasses for well over a month now and I still smell it.

The case the glasses come in has a carabiner, so I hooked them to my backpack. After a month or so, the stitching on the glasses case is starting to rip.

The sunglasses squeak when I open the legs. Not a big deal, but noticeable.

All these things aside, for the 10 or so dollars I paid for them, I'm happy with the purchase. They serve their purpose."
I like it but it is awkwardly shaped and difficult to wear
Changes rubber rain boots to winter warmers
"I like these and I like them more as time goes on. They look contemporary but are comfortable like old lady stretch pants ( and I am nearly an old lady so I can say that!) Love the waistband, it gives a nice smooth look under tunics and long tops. Look good with ballet flats or kitten heels. I'm probably going to stay with this brand for a while and get some more pairs. By the way, I forgot and put them in the dryer, and didn't have any problem with them shrinking."
"my soon wore this for halloween..he looked so scary awesome costume and easy to put on and remove.........plus fun!
Punk Zombie Child Costume Size Medium"
Need an arch to reduce pain.  This casual sandal has the orthaheel support needed.  Can be dressed up or down.  Very happy with this style.  Bought white and black.
"These boots are really nice. I would have given them 5 stars, but it's hard for me to get my left foot into the boot. Wasn't a problem since I had a cast on it, but is not a good thing now. However, I may try to have the boot stretched."
"I bought these throwing track shoes for my daughter. The color is vibrant and the sneakers look exactly like the picture. They fit perfectly and they are very comfortable. IN order to right this review, I put them on and like them as well. Just as my daughter reported, they are very comfortable. She is so excited and is love with these sneakers."
"Love these sneakers. I own 2 in different colors. I normally have to get wide, but these fit just fine. Super lightweight, unlike some others I've tried. Will purchase more!"
"Very cute although much smaller than I'd expected (The portion to write your information on is approx. 2"" Long x 1.5"" High)"
"Gerber always seems to run small so my daughter outgrew these quickly, but they were nice while we used them."
"Love these, one of my favorite styles."
These are amazing! Not a single regret buying them.
"Excellent quality as expected of Samsonite. After poring over reviews of many other brands I'd never heard of and LOOKING AT PICTURES ONLINE ELSEWHERE OF TARGUS THAT IS well-known and had zippers that looked CHEAP AS HECK, went a bit more expensive and got this Samsonite. Its wonderful. Spins like a dream push/pull, I'm 5'6"" and the very tall handle is actually very comfortable. Fits my MacBook Pro 15.5"", cords, notebooks, files of folders pretty well but still has a limit. Rolls great. Only got it a couple weeks ago so don't know how it will hold up but the zippers and fabric right off appear heavy-duty as opposed to Targus and other brands reviewed here so spring for this one. I'm a lady and don't think I could fit ANY clothes plus laptop in this-that's laughable to me, I'd use a full-size carry-on to bring even one extra suit if I went for a business day trip- I only use this back/forth to office/home on daily basis. Wrap your purse strap around the handle, set it on top, and your shoulders are carry-free, wheel away - love it! Only giving 4 instead of 5 due to bit of limited room capacity inside, but if any bigger I suppose it wouldn't fit well underseats on planes but haven't had opportunity to use it for air travel yet. Otherwise its a 5."
Loving my chocolate brown van. I recommend them
"I have historically worn champion bras which serve their purpose.
I got this bra because it looks like a ""normal"" bra but is a more supportive.  I have not been disappointed!  It has all the support needed.  Has straps in the normal positions across the shoulders (no racer back).  The straps are wide, comfortable and adjustable."
Luv this shirt !!! Fits me perfectly and is very comfortable. Luv the tagless back. Will order more of these in different colors.
Bought this for a friend at work's baby. He is adorable in it.
"Very happy with purchase bought more colors.  I am 5'3"" ,130 lbs (DDD), size 6, medium/ large top but ordered small from reading reviews and very happy that I did, any larger I would have been swimming in it.  The small is not curve hugging it fit's and falls perfectly super cute with jeans, leggings or shorts."
Very comfortable bra!! Thank you very much!! Great seller!!
"I love these shoes! I have size 11-12 feet and I ordered an 11.5. They're possibly a bit loose around the toe, but I know a size down would have been too tight. The chunky heel is more supportive and my feet didn't hurt after wearing them all night dancing for my bachelorette party! I plan on buying in more colors :)"
"Beautiful boot. Too big (often a problem that I have with Doc Martens) and not the bright red color that I was hoping for so I returned them. But if you're looking for a dark cherry (more purple than red), these boots are gorgeous."
"Cool Shirt, looks like the picture."
Most comfortable sneakers. Ordered them for my wife's training.
Feels so good irons well
bought this for my son.  He loves the fit and quality.
Very cute! Arrived on time.
I love these!  They are very comfortable and look great.  I would definitely  purchase another pair in a different color.
The product seems if good quality and the pants are comfortable.  I bought them to use on a vacation and therefore have not actually used them.
a bit smaller than I hoped but really cute
"Good shorts, a bit shorter in length that I figured, my wife says I cant wear them in public, haha. I just wear them in our pool."
"My husband works in construction and will only wear Levi's 502 button fly jeans. Nothing else! I panicked at Christmas when all the stores in our area were out of his size. Then i thought to check on Amazon. You had the right size, and the price was 1/3 what i would of paid at the mall stores. Thank you!"
Definitely a full size small (if not slightly more).  Nice fabric.  I would purchase another pair.
I am a size 12 and bought a large - fit perfectly
Perfect sized suitcases for traveling on a 7-day cruise.
"I use these for our milder Florida winters under another shirt. Fit is good, weight is good, keeps me warm and absorbs any sweat. Great on the golf course."
I am so happy with the fit and the quality of these sandals.  I have  trouble with plantar fasciitis and I was so worried that I  would not be able to wear cute sandals any more. These sandals provide great support and look great! Looking forward to summer and wearing my new shoes!  Thank you Vionic!
"These are cute and comfortable, but not as good as the Reef's I used to have."
It's light weight and that's what I was looking for
I have been having a lot of trouble with my arch. I love walking but could not find a comfortable pair of shoes. These shoes give great arch support and I can wear them all day with no discomfort.
"gave out at my ms walk, everyone loved them."
"Perfect! So hard to find good shoes she can walk in for my 18 month old. She has small feet so still in a size 4. The leather on top of the shoe is soft and flexible. The bottom rubber sole isn't too heavy but its nice, thick and sturdy. Perfect fit and oh so cute!!"
"Fits my 6 year old grandson perfectly, couldn't be better!  Excellent material, well made."
"This is a fantastically comfortable bra. I had been wearing Coobie bras for years because I just hate bras. I really wanted a bra as comfortable as the Coobie bras that would add a little shape/lift. This one is super comfortable, fits like a glove to the point where I don't 'feel it'-- which is the objective for me when wearing a bra. I'm going to stock up on these."
Its a little long but great quality.
I love these shoes!  one downside is the footbed is lined with slippery material that makes my foot slide while walking!  I am looking for insteps or something that keeps my foot from sliding in them.  beautiful gold logo and classy shoe!
This is great for me because I have purchased a few watches online and don't want to go to the local watch dealer to get it sized.
The fit is awesome. No issues there. I especially like the fact that you can tighten and loosen it. The clips do tend to undo on my thigh high but I acknowledge the garter belt has fought the uphill battle of restraining things on my thunder thighs quite valiantly so I'm not mad.
Amazing boots...there is no need to break in Cole Haan shoes/boots. They fit like a glove (I wear 7 1/2 but I get size 8 in boots so I can wear light socks to keep my feet warmer and more comfortable. These boots are so sexy and a classic I'll wear for years to come.
I would give this 6 stars.  Beautiful!
Got it for my son and he loves it.  Thanks so much!
My son was super cute what a great costume
"Comfortable, holds everything in and keeps them in place. The logo kind of washes off easy, but otherwise its great"
"My little man looked top notch for sister's wedding. Great setup and QUALITY material is expected. I like suits of this nature. Big question of the day, who pays ring bearer tux cost? Parents or groom and bride?If the child is young, or the ceremony is long, the child may take a seat with parents after he/she has given the rings to both the bride and the groom make sure the outfit matches. After the ceremony, the child may be more comfortable if he/she is able to change into other clothing.  Children do not stand in a receiving line, is another form of wedding etiquette, I know the suspense, whos going to pay the cost of tux?
On the day of the wedding, the ring bearer will walk down the aisle after the bridesmaids and either before the flower girl or with her.  He/she will carry a pillow that has either the bride and grooms rings attached to it, or plastic rings attached.
Depending on the clothing the bride chooses for the ring bearer to wear, the ring bearers parents may be asked to purchase or rent the clothing.  The bride and groom should decide who will pay for the cost of the clothing before the child is asked to participate in the wedding, so there are no misunderstandings.  Generally, the parents pay the costs.
Overall splendid purchase. Affordable. Fun. Proper."
"Prettier than expected.  Got them in both black and white.  Play close attention to reviews regarding size.  I am a size 4 with a 32B cup. 5'5"" I28 lbs and ordered Large because of the reviews. They fit perfectly."
"Looks nice and I get complements, seems to keep good time, a few minutes a month.  It is not a chronograph."
"I have multiple pairs of these shoes, they are incredibly comfortable."
"The tights are well made they are tight you just pull and stretch them like panty hose I am 5""4 and about 115 lbs and they fit great and felt great and went with my elf outfit perfectly I needed a costume at the last minute and thankfully these were prime and came with in a couple of days"
"Dressy shoes, very sturdy heel which works for me as I'm not used to this height of heel.  Very true to size. As usual Ecco does not disappoint. I recommend."
Fits my Swiss Army Watch perfectly!  Good Quality!
It's very stylish. I'm a 5'3 and weight 125 lb. I don't like clothing to tight nor too baggy. The small size was perfect fit. Enough pockets and light weight coat. So far I'm loving it!
Stylish.  Sturdy.  LIghtweight.  Smooth rolling.  Locks included.  VERY attractive.  Excellent purchase.
"It is like wearing well ventilated shoes! These sandals are my go to foot wear all summer; whether going to the beach, going to the store or going to dinner."
"Absolutely adorable costume! I bought a 12-18 month for my 7month old girl and it was too snug by the time Halloween came around but we made it work. She was 20lbs, 26"" at the time."
Love the shirt. Bought large and it fits great and I have long arms. Usually wear XL.
Perfect wig for a photo booth for kids and adults
"I love the length of these shirtsnot too longnot too short.
Thanks"
I Luv it!
"I was hesitant that I wouldn't like this when it arrived but I absolutely love it! It is made with a soft material, very nice coloring. If they had the same scarf with other major cities and landmarks I would most definitely buy those as well!"
"Great seller, highly recommend."
"perfect fit, looks & feels great on! I love PattyBoutik clothing! Im about a size 2......Im 5' 5 & 118 lbs & my measurements are 34-24-34 and I ordered a size small if that helps anyone size choosing wise. It fits just right. Not too tight, not loose though. Looks classy on & can be dressed up or down depending on shoes/accessories. It's very versatile as it can be worn with flip flops, TOMS, Keds, wedge sandals, heels, ect....the fabric is a great summer weight for a hot climate (like Florida) it's thin enough to stay cool but not see through. Love this dress & plan to order more in other colors."
"These things are super warm.  I'm 5'4 and weigh about 120. It's hard to find pants that fit in the waist AND the rear.  I think these run a little bit small. I ended up needing to get the 30 to not have them super tight but could have gone with the 28 if I didn't mind them being SKINNY skinny jeans. AT 28, the waist fit great.  At 30, the rear fits better."
"They fit, they last and they're much cheaper here on Amazon."
"The heal height is too short for me, I feel as if I'm wearing flats."
"This skirt I used under another dress i purchased to make the skirt extra fluffy, it was perfect after I shook it out and left it out overnight to recover from packaging and shipping.  It fluffed up nicely."
"This is precious and PERFECT for our new little addition expected RIGHT in time for March Madness! It is REALLY small, however, it IS a newborn size... so maybe it's just been too long for me to remember how tiny that truly is? I will updated at the beginning for March! :)"
"Cute shoes, very comfortable, fabric is of very good quality as well as the soleplate, they slip on the floor wet immediately, they are a little tight at the top, but I generally love them, use them for the Office and really kept me happy feet =)"
Very comfortable. Love the style!
"this is the perfect gym bag I absolutely love it. it's the perfect size for everything I need- my towel, water bottle, gloves, sneakers, snack, change of clothes, lock, keys, & phone- with plenty of room for more. the quality is fantastic and I LOVE the colors and all the zip pockets inside. this is exactly what I was looking for and it still doesn't look bulky at all which was a concern of mine being of petite frame. would absolutely recommend this!"
I have been wearing MBTs for several years now and love them!  I have rheumatoid arthritis in my feet and they are the only shoe I can wear for most of the day without my feet hurting. I was pleased with the new style of this MBT because it is very attractive. These shoes have rocker bottoms and take some getting use to but once you do they are fantastic!!
"Beautiful dress, it fits as expected. My daughter loved it and the quality did not seem cheap. This dress did not dissapoint."
"I'm so happy with this. The color is beautiful and the material is soft and cool to the touch; it feels great when running outside in October. Very breathable and light, exactly what I hoped."
This thing is great! I do alot of travelling for work now and this bag is pretty much the perfect size to fit a weeks worth of dress clothes and very easily carry it on the plane which is exactly what I need it to do. Very high quality bag :)
Heads up people. These run at least a half size smaller than what sizing chart says! Had to return mine.
"Even though I had to return this product because it was too long, it really was a good quality. The store answered my questions about how it would fit, but I didn't ask the length mesasurement. I would recommend emailing them if you aren't sure."
This is perfect! I was just able to take it on a trip. Very light weight. Very well thought out design.
Perfect fit! Original Seiko rubber dive band. Fits my Seiko SRP639K1 Men's Prospex Automatic Dive Stainless steel perfectly. Highly recommend. Semper Fi Mike
the pants do not have pockets...other than that everything is a-ok
great watch at a great price!
Wish I would secure a little higher up on the leg to prevent snow from getting in but totally comfy and warm regardless
"A little more sheer than I thought they'd be, but the leggings are super comfortable. Just have to wear a longer shirt or tank top with it."
"They arrived too late for the  production that we purchased them for, and although we ordered a size up, I'm concerned they will be too small by then."
Will be cute wearing under a longer top or dress. Kinda tight.
I got the black leather boots and the leather is very soft and it appears to be good quality.  The stitching looks very sturdy and I believe that they will last a long time.  I normally wear size 10 even in other Clark's footwear I have had but I ordered the 9.5 based on reviews and they fit perfectly.  The sides of the crepe sole are painted black so that these can be dressed up a bit.  After wearing them several times I can tell you that they are really comfortable although they could use a tad more arch support.  They look great with blue jeans or a pair of khakis.  These boots are nice!
"These are awesome!  my husband immediately commented on how much he liked them before I even had them zipped up! lol very comfortable, thinking of getting a second pair."
Cute shorts for Ace Venture costume and just to use after Halloween. :D
Really cute! I love it
The shoe is nice looking and fits perfectly. I really like the looks of the shoe and it is very comfortable. I highly recommend this shoe for casual wear or training.
"Excellent walking shoe. I buy a new pair about every 10 months. Do a lot of walking for exercise. Give great support and absorb heel shock on hard surfaces.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/New-Balance-Men-s-623v3-Training-Shoe-Black-9-4E-US/dp/B00V3MO5MI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">New Balance Men's 623v3 Training Shoe, Black, 9 4E US</a>"
cheap. easy to see
Love love love these booties! Miz Mooz is my go to for shoes and these do not disappoint. The leather was soft from the start and the stacked heel makes the shoe rather comfortable. I can easily wear them for a few hours before I notice the heel. I do think if they had a little platform in the front they'd be more comfortable but that's all I have to complain about. I also love the narrow opening at the ankle. My ankles are not thin by any means but I don't like the large openings that some booties have.
"Very impressed very happy with the fit  , how it feels after hours of wearing it from  a large breasted women im happy !!!!!!!!!"
Pockets on women's sweat pants are a must for me.
great jeans for a great price
"These shoes are narrow. I had them stretched a bit. So now, I am wearing them in."
Nice quality shirts.  I have been buying them for years.  The colors are usually true to what is shown online.
It's a beautiful  costume .it would not zip up. and that was the largest and I wear a 16-18 .
This is my 3rd pair.  They are super comfortable.  I just wish they weren't so expensive.
Wonderful! I'm only 5 1' so I gave an extremely hard time finding scrubs to fit. But I ordered these in a petite and they fit perfectly!
These shoes  fit so well; I have this style in multiple colors.  I buy a different color of this shoe each year.
My kids were able to walk up and down our steep hills to school with these with no problems.
fit great and colors are holding well in the wash.
Got this for my husband and boy was he happy.  Very well made and fits perfectly.  He said it keeps him nice and warm also likes the versatility of being able to wear it up or down as it keeps his neck warm as well.
"I love these! I work in nursing and they give me great support and my feet are not as tired at the end of the shift if I was wearing another shoe. I average about 7 to 10 miles a shift. The mesh isn't that tight so your feet breath really well and avoid that sweaty foot, however if you are in my field and need to give a patient a shower your feet will get wet but they dry really quick. I highly recommend these."
"After reading other reviews I ordered a large.  I'm 5'9"" 150#s and I normally wear an 8.  This fits great, it hugs perfectly.  The material is beautiful and so soft and comfortable.  The lace and satin both have stretch, I work out and my upper arms are bigger so I was worried but nothing to worry about at all. Also being tall I can easily wear a low heel (1 1/2 "") and the dress still skins the floor.  For this price you absolutely cannot go wrong.  I got the burgundy, which is beautiful."
This is an eye catching shirt. A great quality T-shirt with the 2nd Amendment Skull logo printed front and back. It makes a great statement. Equal to it's Ad and reasonable price for the quality. Thanks for the great buy!
Gift for Grandchildren
my only complaint is that the chains are way too small.
Love Birks!
"Good quality, is as shown in picture, provides great support for more active days."
Absolutely love this watch! I've always been a Swiss fanatic and it's wonderful! I have wide wrists for a female and it fit perfectly!
"Very warm, soft, and packable.  Good fit.  Very happy."
Nice suit for the price!
"So soft, Alot of room for cell, wallet and everything else. It was a little bigger than I was looking for, but it works."
"Why I'm reviewing boys boxer briefs is beyond me, but Hanes briefs, tried and true. 'Nuff said."
The cobalt blue with the gold discs make this a stunning sandal. I wore them to the movies and as I walked passed two stylish ladies I heard them comment on my sandals! I ordered a 7 1/2 wide and on the tightest hole they are a bit loose. I may be able to wear a regular width in these. In would like to get other colors in this shoe. Beyond smart looking these have a padded sole that makes them more comfortable than the average sandal.
WHO doesn't love flannel?
I love these! Exactly what I was looking for!!!
"A nice fitting, heavy cotton t-shirt. E,enjoy wearing it."
Fun item.. one size fits all is good for me and my daughter.
Holding up great and perfect fit.
"I bought two of the same light pink -- one for me, one for my sister -- and we love them so much! The weight is perfect and they're beautifully crafted, just the right size, and the cord is terrific since we can adjust the length to match any outfit. Lovely color. They're dressy enough for church and casual enough for running errands. I've received many compliments. The symbology of each element (the simulated leather cords, the wire, the nails) make these crosses even more meaningful. Too, this seller thoughtfully included care instructions and an email address for comments or problems.

I should point out (since I was confused) the horseshoe crosses that sell for .01 are from a different seller named ""Horseshoe Crosses."" The crosses are smaller and while I can't tell if they won't last as well as the ChanCrafted crosses I'm reviewing here until I wear them more (I bought two later on, thinking they were made by the same folks), the ones made by Jamie of ChanCrafted Artisan Jewelry [...] are my favorites. They're larger (perfectly sized), well crafted, and the wire coverage is obviously better. Very fast delivery for both. Mind, I'm not saying the ones made by Horseshoe Crosses are in any way shoddy, but I just don't see how they can make a profit at a penny a piece without cutting corners somewhere. According to the ChanCrafted insert, the shipping charge pays for the shipping, the supplies to make the crosses, and the Amazon fees. The $4.99 is the cost of the time it takes to make them and Jamie's expertise. Well worth the modest price, IMHO. At any rate, five stars for these crosses!"
I ordered this for my granddaughter for Christmas.  It arrived promptly and was even cuter than I imagined.  Appears to be well made and sturdy.  The embroidery is nicely done.  I would buy again.
"I was looking for a comfortable short for camping and outdoor activities. So far these are great! I was pleasantly surprised because it can be risky ordering shorts online because fit can be challenging for all body types. The material of these is nice and breathable. I typically wear a size 10 and went with a Large since I like my shorts on the loose side. These are the exact fit I like; not too short and not too long (they hit just shy of my fingertips and I'm 5'6). The legs openings are nice and wide and not binding. The fit is flattering especially to my thighs. I ordered the purple color and am very pleased. I plan to order another pair. I haven't gotten to test them out in water so I can't attest to their drying abilities yet, but so far I have no complaints!  I'd say ordering your true size will be just fine, but if you like them loose in the legs and thighs go up a size!"
Very good quality! I bought for my son as a gift and he loves it...
"THESE SHOES ARE VERY NICE.  I JUST WISH I COULD BUY THE BLACK PAIR TOO, BUT THEY ARE OUT OF STOCK OF SIZE 5'S.  THESE ARE VERY COMFY, AND THE PERFECT FIT AND HEIGHT.  THE ONLY DRAW BACK WOULD BE THE LEATHER SEEMS A BIT SOFT, BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT MEANS THEY WON'T LAST, SO OVER ALL, THESE ARE GREAT SHOES."
"I would give this a 10/10 in both color and fit.  Ok, and pattern.  So soft.  I order plus and am usually 12-16 depending on brand.  These are awesome.  I have 8 of them and will continue to order."
"These leggings are so warm and comfortable! They don't slid down in the crotch like some tights do. They are thick like pants but flexable. I live in New England where it can be very cold and I think they will keep me warm out doors just fine. The only thing I didn't like was that the feet have dye in them and they turned my socks and inside my slippers dark blue after only wearing them 5 mins, but I'm sure they just need to be washed."
"This version (Z-Trail) is too small for my wide feet. I contacted the manufacturer and they told me to exchange them for the Z-Trek, which is slightly wider. If you have wide feet, save yourself some time and get the Z-Trek instead."
"I'm not skinny and these won't just make me thin,but it's a nice level of compression. It is not uncomfortable in any way, but I can always feel it, so it's great for correcting a lazy slouched stance/gate. Don't get me wrong, it's not uncomfortable when I do ""relax"" a little, but it obviously gets way tighter which reminds me. I wear X/XXL depending on style and cut of shirt. Most T's are fine in an X, nicer stuff usually XX. Bought the XL size. Haven't had to wear a suit in over a year so I don't have my actual chest measurements on hand. I know that would help more sorry. 40 waist. Probably around 46in chest."
"I love the fit of these shoes, not tight at all and I can wear thick socks. On the box they say ""Relaxed fit"" so not a wide shoe but ample space for good socks. Nice grip soles but not enough to ""trip"" you. Love the reinforced rubber toe for when on my hands and knees the toe of the shoe does not get scraped."
A giant sun hat for the beach.  So big you can hide under it.
"Bought three, very pleased with fit."
"Great lightweight robe, exactly what I wanted. Belt is attached, which I really like"
"Fabulous, comfortable and the look very expensive. The price was fantastic bought two pairs"
These are awesome!! They are so big and I love it!!!
"Great product, great price, the silver part comes with quicksilver letters and fits perfect (down side) with belt. I recommend this product."
"Finally, a sports bra for a large woman who wants to work out!!!!  It fits!!!  It's been three years to find one.  Love it!"
Very pretty bark like pattern with nice embroidery. Opaque enough to wear without a slip.pretty enough to wear in public.
Love them they fit well and the color is perfect
"I love them and they help with Plantar Fascitis...However, they run small...so buying next size up from normal size."
"It's easy to set the multi functions and it's really cute, love the deep turquoise color.  I'm used to expensive watches with silver or stainless steel bands. It took me 3 days to get used to the feel of the resin band.  Initially It felt heavy and rigid but it seems to soften over time with your body's heat and mold to your wrist. After the band relaxed I had to tighten the band by one hole. That's been my experience and I am very pleased with this watch."
"Excellent denim men's shorts, wears well and looks great."
"There should be a 10 stars rating for this item. It is so cute and so expensive looking...The star itself could be rated as tiny(abt 0.7 cm/0.2755"")but it's perfect for a girl. The chain is very thin but it holds up and the lock is perfect. I love it!"
"I've had these earrings a few months, I wear them a lot, they are cute, not heavy and the closures are fantastic! I can sleep in these without them falling out and getting lost. I also think their classy..... Glad I bought these!!"
"Love these.  They are extremely comfortable, cute, and can easily walk for miles"
These were a Christmas gift for my wife and she loves them.  I see her wearing them all the time.
"Adorable jacket, we've received tons of compliments on it. It keeps him toasty warm and fits great"
"Good coverage, nice and long so it stays down and can even be tucked in.  Color is a little darker and browner than I was hoping (wanted a little grayer beige, and it's more a coffee), but it's fine for my purposes.  The lace is a pretty touch on what is a basic tank-cami."
Fits well but still shows up very defined under fitted dresses. Doesnt roll down though and is quite firm.
"I'm 5'3, 115lbs, 34B. I bought a small/medium - it ended a few inches above my knees but it was too large. Very unfortunate bc the fabric was soft and style was cute. If I was 10+ lbs heavier it would look more fitting."
"We keep buying these, not all from amazon although we were glad they carried them. As the girls feet grow we keep buying them bigger. Adorable and elegant."
"This purse is freaking fantastic! I am picky about my purses. I like them to have some organization to them, but also enough space to fit all my crap. This purse, as stated in the title, is magical. It has ample space for my ""crap"" AND pockets on the sides for my small stuff. This amazing purse fits all of my stuff and does it in a way that is compact and doesn't scream ""I can fit most of my house in here!""
On a side note, the faux leather (or possible unicorn skin) has that buttery, real-leather feel to it and looks very classy. I may order another color just to have options. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PURSE!
P.S. I'll upload some pics so you can see all the crap I can fit in it."
"So far so good - using it for Studio Circuit Training Classes.  Providing alot of cushioning and support, especially for lateral moves and heel impact moves.  It also breathes very well for a gym shoe."
My daughter enjoys playing dress up with this set.
My husband really likes these Harriton polo's. They fit great and also at a great price.
Thanks for my hubby's new favorite shoes. These are comfortable and look great with khakis.
I loved these black Capri leggings. They fit perfect and they are very comfortable. Very pleased with my purchase. =)
Classy and great fit! Very comfortable with cotton covered elastic band.
Love the shoes. Never disappointed with this brand.
I absolutely love this bra!
Great Handbag. Great size and appearance. Lot of space. I get a lot of compliments. Highly recommend this handbag!!
"Nice wallet. Nothing extraordinary, but I like it. It matches the purse I bought pretty well."
I have the jeans in the same size and these are 1 size too small. Disappointed - sizing is not consistent I have found in this brand. Order 1 size up.
"My son's favorite outfit. He wears this every time I wash it while ignoring most every other thing. The quality was very good on it, no threads coming lose and no color fading."
Very good quality of product.
"Contrary to all the conspiracy theorists who wrote negative reviews on something they've never seen, I have received this luggage set and can say that these are very good quality pieces. The large 28"" case is a lot larger than I expected and is big enough to stuff my mother-in-law inside. It's so big, I almost wish I'd bought the smaller set. The wheels roll smooth as glass and the nylon cordura type material seems to be very tough and durable.
This luggage was made in China, as I suspect almost all of it is nowadays, but I believe it was a steal of a deal at the price I paid."
Most comfortable boots I've ever warn. I've hiked and camped over 20 miles in these with dry feet and no blisters/hot spots.
love this robe.
Perfect leggings for the gym!
"Great Watch, good material, Box is poor though.,"
My boyfriend loved the ring!!! It fit great.
When those cold winds blow this is very comfy.
"Very cute, I really loved it"
I bought these for my wife and she really loves them.
"It is s beautiful ring, fits perfect with my MK watch, I've had a lot of compliments, it might be a bit uncomfortable at first but believe me you get used to it."
Beautifully elegant and very warm. Excellent purchase
"I love the color. my only complaint is, I'm a 5'6 and the top feels a little on the short side. but fits well in every other way."
"I ordered these Birkenstock Unisex Arizona Sandals for my husband's upcoming birthday. The pair that he has had for the last 20+ years were finally wearing out in the heel.
I used the information from tne soles of the previous shoes to reorder, and they are a perfect fit! He loves them!"
"This bra is comfortable,  soft, supportive,  and gives great shape to the girls! I love the wide back straps that smooth the back instead of digging in creating a bulge. I finally found a bra I'm in love with!"
Very nice shoe for the price. I brought as gift and my friend loved them not sure on the comfort yet.
"I love these shoes, Asics just keep getting better and better.  I have had multiple pairs of running shoes and these never give me blisters, shin splits or pain anywhere.  They are narrow, light weight and the colors are great, the front is darker gray than the picture shows which I like.  SUPER COMFY!"
"Gift for my teen aged son, he is a DJ and he loves it."
Exceptional quality boots. The color they are online is exactly what I received.
So comfortable it's a win.
"quality construction, bright colors and adjustable.  This is my son's favorite Pokmon hat.  It looks like it will actually stand up to daily wear."
I love this top!  It's a beautiful blue soft fabric and is really soft. It's not too big even though I went up two sizes from my usual size.  It's long enough for me to wear with leggings.
"cute top, but i expected it to be looser, and it is fitted"
My 2 year old loves these and I like how simply dressy they are. Can't go wrong with these.
Absolutely lovely no complaints
I have a few pair of Lee Dungaree shorts. These fit just like the others and I like the new pattern. Will be back for more.
"My son loves these.  The only problem is, they do track in tons of dirt."
My Batman Husband loves it. Fits well. As promised by seller. Prompt order received. Wearing well. Highly recommend.
"Love these for ultra-light packing! I purchased two of these after trying many other packing cubes of similar size, include smaller eBags. At first glance these seem tiny, and the fabric extremely thin. However when I stuffed them completely full, I was amazed at how much they hold! In just one of these small bags, I was able to fit a sports bra, 3 pairs of wool hiking socks, and 6 pairs of underwear. You can actually use them as a stuff sack, if you zip up the one size and place them on end. When stuffed completely full, I was still worried that the fabric or the seams would rip, since it is so thin. However after poking and prodding and stuffing them into my backpack in many ways, I'm convinced that they'll hold up. Also, the zipper seems well made and zips very smoothly. I will be purchasing the larger ones as well, since they add virtually no weight to my bag!"
"Perfect fit, perfect color.  I can't wait to wear them!"
I ordered a 30-32 for my son. He's a teacher so can always use nice pants. They fit perfectly and looked nice. Perfect for work.
"Even though I thought this romper would be more saggy at the top, it was still cute and worked well as a swimsuit cover. It was very comfortable and the material is soft. After washing, no shrinkage or fading."
Great for little guys!  These are holding up great for my 6 year old.  Great fit!
No camel toe! :) Fit great and I wear them for CrossFit WODs. Love them and bought them in all colors.
"My 4 year old daughter needed new ballet shoes. These shoes were a better deal than the previous brand I bought, so I thought I would give them a try. I am glad I did! I bought a size up from her street shoe size, and there is definitely room to grow. They are narrow, but that is to be expected with ballet shoes. The front tie allows you to tighten the shoes, so even though her toes don't quite reach the end, they work just fine. The quality seems good as well."
This small bag is exactly what I was looking for.  It is small enough that it is easy to carry around for the day but large enough to include all of the little things I want with me.  I use it for day trips and it couldn't be better.
Great looking watch! Big but no too big.....
"Very nice quality, light and good looking."
100% gotten. It arrives very stiff but softens up after every wash. Beautiful trim and lovely detail on sleeves. Very cool and comfortable yet covers everything nicely if u have kids as i do.
I only wear 514 jeans because they fit and feel perfect
"I bought this as a Christmas present for my boyfriend & he likes his shirts a little bit larger than what his actual shirt size. I don't know how they decide how small or large to cut the fabric for the shirts but I'm assuming they cut them a little smaller than say for example... Faded Glory cuts their shirts for guys. Plus there is the fact these shirts are 100% cotton so of course I bought a large (originally), since he normally wears a medium. That one ended up fitting him a little more snuggly than he would have liked so we tried again. Hence the is review for the 3XL... It's long enough but it is too wide (he doesn't have a weight problem like me). It's a great product that is avaiable in different beautiful colors. It is perfect for Attack On Titan fans! Just make sure to read the size info more carefully than I did! ^_~"
Perfect for outside - Work for an NFL team - great jacket as well it keeps you warm.
Great fit best thing I purchase for my csection.
Adorable little shirt/cape
Very cute jacket. It's light weight. Smelled funny when it was delivered but I washed it and it's fine.
My daughter loves this boots.  She wears them every time she can.
Fits very good and these are amazingly soft inside
"nice Chain - long enough to go over my head, seems pretty sturdy, looks good. it's a pretty masculine chain, if that helps, and my girlfriend likes it on me. i like it."
reviewed  just after Christmas when I bought it
"Great material for costume quality, should last a while.
Buttons put it over the top, great item!"
"Surprisingly comfortable all things considered.  Easy to attach to standard belt loops and of course, having no metal content, should allow me to walk through TSA.  Also easy to adjust while being worn."
returned for the shade of violet..nothing wrong with the shirt...I ordered the black instead..
"The wifey ( BOOBOO) LOVES THE WAY I BE LOOKING, ESPECIALLY ,  This one...."
"I go from store to store trying desperately to find cute swimming suits... I NEVER would have thought to order one online. But I love it. I am 5' 10"" 170lbs with leftover purge and stretch marks from a 9lbs baby. This suit is what I need. Ruffles on the front are amazing. I bought an XXL. Bottoms fit fine, but the top is a little too big in the cups.
The only annoying thing I foresee about this suit is having to adjust the bottoms constantly. Other than that, I love it."
"First of all order a size 1.5 larger than your Nike's or Adidas. That being said My twin 11yr.olds play soccer and own well 5 different soccer boots each (cleats are called boots in the Futbol world) Hypervenom's, Mecurials, Predators (both instinct and Absoluto) and Tiempo's. They love these Pumas. I noticed their passing and striking sound crisp  and ball control is great. The feedback is I love them. I asked better than your others? One says same as the Adiddas Pedators (both the same) the othe loves these he most."
This is a good size and well made shoe horn. Great price. I am ordering another one for my dad.
"Beautiful..Im happy with them and my ring,that even my daughter is wearing them.!! Price is GREAT!"
My girlfriend wears them all the time.. Its time to get her a white pair now
"Works  very well for my little nephew, can enjoy the beach avoiding sun burn. The matterial is pretty god, and fits as expeected."
Husband loves it just what he wanted
I absolutely love this product!!!!! I use these a lot!!!!!! Especially when j leave work with migraines!!!!!! I recommend these glasses!!!!
The items are beautiful but they are hard to fasten.  Can't put it on by myself
"Detailed pictures, secure lose zippers. I can't wait to take it out for part of my costume."
Husband has been wearing these on his work boots for a month now.  They aren't showing any wear or tear.
"Highly recommend! The legs stay in place, it's very comfortable, and the material is lovely!!"
"Ordered this backpack right before my 3 year old was starting preschool. It fits him perfectly and is so adorable.
The bag is small enough for him to carry it comfortably and if the bag holds up he should be able to use it for a few years.
He carries a travel wipes container, a few diapers and at least one change of clothes and there is plenty of room.
The side pocket expands to hold a supply cup or bottle of water but it also has a snap to keep something small in it, like my 3 year old's rocks, safely enclosed."
Great product!! Perfect fit! Great quality
"I like this, it's a nice thin short sleeve cardigan that you can wear over a tank in the summer or a long sleeve shirt for a layered look in the cooler months. Versatile, not to heavy. CUTE! I bought three colors, the white fits perfectly, the coral and pink one I bought seem a little more snug, but still work for layering."
"I don't remember chinos being a men's staple when Dockers released it's first.  Back then, Dockers wasn't owned by Levi's and their biggest competition was probably Bugle Boy.  Their first chino was casual and rugged, as chinos were meant to be, since they originated for military wear.

At some point over the next few years, as chinos grew in popularity and Levi's purchased Dockers, they began making them more dressy and with lighter fabrics.  The chino went from a rugged pant that was a step up from jeans, to a super casual option for business.  They went from a pant mostly worn by younger men, to a pant mostly worn by older men.

Why am I telling you this?  Because the Dockers Alpha pant is more like the original Dockers chino, that was more rugged and casual than what we now associate with the chino pant.  The Dockers Signature is the culmination of what the chino has become - i.e. lighter biz-casual pants made for older men, who may want to iron a crease down the middle of the leg.  In contrast, the Dockers Alpha is the pant you want to wear with boots, while foraging through the forest or anything that requires outdoor activity.

Nothing against biz-casual wear, but the dressy chino is just so mundane.  I love the Dockers Alpha and I find it shameful that the clothing industry has, for the most part, turned the chino into a dressy pant.  Hopefully Dockers will continue making the Alpha forever and offer new fits when necessary.  I've always preferred rugged chinos and always will, so while I might change my preference on the fit, it's unlikely that I'll ever prefer a more dressy chino."
Awesome delivery and product
"This headband is a show stopper.  It is huge and cumbersome but adorable, nonetheless.  Baby wore it for a few photo shoots but on our first day out, she tore it apart within minutes.  The heavy sequin bow is hot glued to the feathers which is glued to felt and glued to the headband. I bought this headband intending to remove the feathers and reattach the bow because it is a gorgeous bow but loved the look of it as a whole once it arrived and kept intact (until baby pulled it apart, of course). I did eventually salvage and reconfigure the bow and headband.  I recommend this product for purposes of photo shoots but not for a day out.  Note that the feathers do not look like those pictured,  they do not curve against the head, they are flat (reference the picture)."
I find Fryes run a half size small. Shoe I wear 7.5-8m. 8.5 is perfect for me with Frye boots. Love this style. These are nice with skinnies to show the western feel (not too cowboy) and look classic with the slight rounded toe with boot cut. Best price on Amazon. I just saw these on another site for $174!

It has a nice real leather band and a classy looking face. I would not have guessed it costs under $30 if I did not see the listing price. The band maximum width 8.25"" (from the clasp to the last hole), if needed additional holes could be made to make it as wide as 8.5"".  The watch's face is 40mm (1.57"") wide and the watch is 7.5 mm (0.30"") thick.

The watch shows just hours, minutes and seconds. It shows no date.

Amazon description states that it is water resistant, but the watch case has no markings that it is water resistant.

This watch is provided by Besseron for evaluation and review. Overall, this is a very basic watch with an attractive face and band.

Ali Julia review"
"I ordered these boots for my husband for Christmas.  The price was awesome, and so were the boots!  He thinks they are very comfortable.  Thank you Amazon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
I use this for my Stabilo markers for coloring. It holds 60 markers and not bulky when full. There's still space inside.
"The color is perfect, they are very comfortable and even though they do not have any ornament, they look very chic and elegant, and have the ideal height of heels."
"Great case. I got mine for my sunglasses.
It is a hard-ish heavy duty nylon, zippered,snapping loop for attaching to your belt etc. as well as a heavy clip attached to the end.
I feel my glasses are safe and secure in this case.
I also keep a glasses strap and my bluetooth in the case, no problem at all."
It's even cuter in real life. My granddaughter loves it. So different from others at her school. Seems to be well made and is perfect size for a preschooler.
This shoe is as it looks. It fits great for lazy wear. But if you sweat in your shoes or get them wet... they stretch out and do not shrink back.
Simple. These go with everything.
My daughter loves this robe. It's definitely super soft.
Liked this product very much
The absolute best sneaker or sneakers I have ever purchased!!!  I'm able to golf an entire round without my feet and ankles feeling like they are disintegrating!!  If you are experiencing any trouble with your feet or ankles you have to purchase this shoe!!  You won't regret it!!!
Super cute.. gave as a gift and it presented well and has been holding up nicely.
Glad it's large because I like my lounge around stuff loose and comfy.  Soft material.
Great product ordered another
They were fine and fit all the guys well enough but they were a much lighter grey than expected based on the photos. Very very pale against white shirts.  Would not buy again.
They are as you expect from Crocs.
I received this ring at a discount in return for my honest review. I got this for my husband for his new wedding band. It is absolutely breathtaking. It's very solid and definitely has weight to it. I recommend this one.
"Good fit, great for lounging around."
"The quality of this while it is exceptional. The leather feels very soft yet strong, and the color is exactly as I expected from the picture. My husband prefers smaller wallet, so this isn't one he would Carrie, but I like the size for myself to throw in my purse, so it works great for me.  I do think it would probably be a bit too bulky for a man to comfortably carry in his back pocket all the time."
They fit perfectly.  I'd buy more in a heat beat and would love to see more color variations.
My daughter won 'Most Unique Costume' at her school's Halloween dance while wearing this costume.  Its comfortable and adorable.  Recommend!
I love this wallet!  It arrived exactly as detailed description said it would be. Nice leather.  Love all the compartments.
It fit just like the picture and has a lining. Same apricot as in the photo
I really like these! They fit perfectly! I needed a sexy black shoe to go with my outfit for my 21st Birthday. They are pretty comfortable to wear for a few hours but not exactly for an entire night of dancing. I wish they came in nude because I would definitely buy them again in that color. I would definitely recommend.
"Super nice, and unique have to say. My wife love it"
Great price for a good pair of jeans!
As is pictured
Loved this dress but had to return as it did not fit my body well and showed all the imperfections and love handles. Otherwise would have been great
great watch thank you
Vibrant colors. Thumbs up 
"They don't work in the pool, so there are not very waterproof."
got these for my daughter and she said they were too big. they are nice and very well made
I bought these for my granddaughter and she absolutely loves them and they look so great on her. I would recomment these. She also said they were very comfortable.
I saw a review that the medium was perfect for a size 4 so I ordered the large at the last moment. A little big but I can layer and use the drawstring. I also love the ability to cuff the sleeve!
"Its a cute vest, however it does run small. I bought a medium and my hips are 38 and its snug when zipped. The pockets have nice zippers but they are small. My passport fits but just barely."
worth the money I wear it every day!
"These bras are pretty, comfortable and easy to put on.  The only thing I do wish is that they could figure out how to make the seam not so apparent, it will show through on thin knits.
For those with modesty issues, this bra will not conceal a ""chill"" so that may be a factor for some people.
I wish they came in more colors, I would have one for every day of the week!
Update: This last one seems to have a different clasp, feels stronger. I've only had one break on me and that was after a year but I know it's been an issue with some reviewers."
"When the boots arrived, I loved them!  I immediately put them on.  They felt a little snug.  The first day that I wore them, they were easily broken in and comfortable in no time.  I love them.  I would wear them every day with everything if I could.  I've gotten compliments from everyone!  Best boots ever!"
"I had been disappointed with Volatile shoes in the past (too loose on the strap, heel slowly compacting, lining of heel tearing off, etc...) but these are holding well. The heel is not too high for me and I can wear them for extended periods of time and/or walking through town. They look good on the foot, blending in well with a large range of outfits. Happy about the purchase. package arrived quickly. They fit my foot well. I have a high arch, regular width foot."
"Thank you, my daughter draw Minecraft designs on it for her brother... it was awesome! Thank you."
Love the design and colors on this Wallet Case. It is bright and so pretty. All of my credit cards fit in it perfectly and I still have room to add more. It seems to be well made and was packaged very well. This replaced a older Case and I am happy because it closes easier and the clasp seems to be much sturdier than my old Case.
"Love this sweater! Very cozy. I'm 5'1"" so it's a little long, but looks great with skinny jeans or leggings!"
Really lovely print. Material nice too.
This top is very nice. Thanks for the great condition.
OOH so warm and cozy.  So soft to the touch.
"they are comfortable, very"
"Fantastic shipping, I was really happy to get it quickly. However, the silicon packet broke open inside the suitcase and was not a pleasant birthday suprise. The case looks nice and I hope it lasts awhile"
"Love them, good fit, try to size. I'm a size 8 with voluptuous thighs, hips and butt, and these fit with a bit of extra room. A medium might have worked just as well, but I like this fit."
"I thought of it as outdoorsman wear, but fabric seems so delicate only good hiking down well groomed trails.  But it does look good, several people complimented me when they saw it."
"went by size chart, chose medium for adult size but think small might have worked better"
"Great cleaning cloth, this shines things up nicely! Very large size, I may even cut it down and share it."
"I bought this to wear in Vegas for halloween.  I love the way this costume looks, but there was a fixable fit issue.  The costume is cute, it fits well through the bodice and the skirt hits right below my butt so that my entire butt is covered (although I did buy a short petticoat to wear under the skirt for some extra fit and coverage).  I have a longer torso and had tried on some other Halloween costumes that didn't cover my butt at all.  This one at least covers it, but I certainly won't be bending over in this out in public.  The main fit issue that I had was that there was way too much material in the bust.  I am a 34 C and I felt like my boobs were lost in all the extra fabric.  For a quick fix day of Halloween I pulled down and tucked the extra white fabric into the top of the black bodice piece and pinned it into place.  I eventually would like to sew it in, but haven't gotten around to it yet.  My only other problem with the costume is that it arrived extremely wrinkled.  Both the cape and the skirt were extremely wrinkled and both say that they can't be ironed.  I tried ironing the costume through another piece of fabric and it just barely helped.  I wish there was another way to iron the costume.  Other than those two minor issues, I'm still pretty happy with the overall look of the costume."
Exceptional design and fit. Bravo.
good big girls
"Beautiful plugs and they came very quickly. I read other reviews that had suggested that it was hard to fit the plugs into some peoples' ears, but as long as your ears have been gauged for an adequate amount of time, there should be no problems."
Looked great but fit large and wide.  I returned the product.
Similar to the ones you get at the hospital. Only complaint is the price but they were worth it to get through the next few weeks after delivery.
Very cute skirt.  I am 5'9 and 145lbs and the medium worked perfectly.  The length was great and the material was soft and clingy.
Awesome find!
This bag is luxurious. The leather is supple and the size is perfect.
"This is a beautiful, well made, elegant jacket that looks great with my victorianesque goth looks, and the material and quality are truly incredible for the price.  I especially love the fact that the lacing in the back means it's adjustable so I can modify it to fit my specific shape (I have a small waist and many things are too boxy for me)"
Its like having 10 t shirts in one
"Ok, I really like these bracelets, but my one gripe is how they close.  Trying to get the one piece in is challenging, but once you do, they stay, much better then the ones you pull to tighten though, that's why the 4 stars."
"The dress is very pretty and the colors are just as pictured, bold and bright.  I have a little room in the dress which brings out my shape and makes me look great!  The dress is very comfortable and cool and soft and the material is strong and made well, not see through.  I know I will have this dress for a long time.  I have ordered other dresses from MSK and I am never disappointed.  This dress fits me just right and I am 5'2 and weighs 145 lbs, in a size small.  This dress will be worn to work and church and I already have a pretty shrug to wear with it just in case I get cold.  These are the deals I like when I order a dress from Amazon good material, good dress, good taste and good prices!!!"
I ordered a small it fits really snug you should go a size up. Overall it's a nice comfortable dress for the price and thick material. I would order another one in a size bigger.
Thank you Brother Jeff # Soldiers in CHRIST United
I love the texture and feel
"Gift, would recommend great seller as well"
This ring is stunning. I wear it as my new wedding set! I was in the market and the cashier took my hand and said WOW your ring is beautiful! I politely smiled and said Thank you!! The delivery was as promised...
Perfect amount of lining/padding. My favorite sports bra.
"Perfect size, i surely recommend."
gorgeous and super comfy. form fitting.
This is a fun shirt! It was bought as a gift for my teenager. He wears it often. It is a great fit and washes up nicely. I have not seen any defects.
I love this luggage.  It's extremely roomy and lightweight.  Shouldn't have any problem with weight limitations on airplanes with this one.  Spinner feature is fantastic.
"I love the Merrell shoes in general, they fit great for me, and I really like the minimalist footwear that doesn't go between the toes (that drives me nuts).  These are super cute, light and comfortable."
Very pretty.  Love it
"Although I am hesitant to purchase clothing over the net, this pant fits perfectly and is high quality. I am totally satisfied with all aspects of the purchase"
Love them good house slippers
Black suede shoes are hard to find! These are exactly what I was looking for and at a great price. I've worn them a couple of times and the fit is as expected and they are pretty comfortable. Bonus that the company donates to a charitable organization.
This time my brother was thrilled as the fit was perfect.  I generally ask him before ordering for him. Glad I had forgotten about the bad experience last time!
They're Levis'.
"I ordered several Maxi Dresses from Amazon, because you can't beat the affordable prices.  I loved the Classic Designs Striped Strapless Dress, but was worried that it wouldn't look right on me.  To my surprise, it fits true to size and is super cute on for any event.  Very Happy with the purchase!"
Love the group! Makes a great way to keep things in one place instead of all over- as I had been...
"I love this bracelet. Better than described. Shipping was fast, packaged well. Fits perfectly and everyone comments on how cute it is. Mixed with other bracelets and love how it stands out! Seems very well-made also."
Will definitely recommend it
"Very fitted, but a good length."
"Comfortable fit, love the well positioned, good size pockets. Hope to get a long life  out of these pants."
"Awesome, fits and feels great."
Very cute and nice quality. Purchased this for my grandson looks so adorable on him.
Strap Loops and Mounting tool made me very happy and a trip to the local mall. Just make sure you order the right size for your watch. Mine is an Invicta and it fist just perfectly. Highly recommended-Save Money
"After buying speedo water shoes that were terrible, I gave these a shot.  Almost every review I read was accurate.  The shoe fits true to size and yes they are not comfortable because of the drains on the bottom of them.  For wearing in the ocean or if you are doing some swimming and don't want to have to switch shoes this is a good way to go.  For hiking I can't imagine there aren't better ideas for footwear than this.  They are just not very comfortable.  But for my use these work perfect.  They dry very fast and that's really my main concern."
This necklace is so beautiful and the customer service is excellent!
Beautiful..love it
"Doesn't look just like the photo.  It's not vinyl, but a cotton/polyester blend, but it's still a good value for the price and looks good, just don't wear the zipper that low!. lol  A good spray starch helps a lot so that it holds its shape better & is more form fitting."
"excellent pants, fit like jeans but with some tactical mixed in. very comfortable but a little snug."
"Very jazzy looking, I bought for my 10 month old.  Their too long for her small ears so I wear them and I love them!!"
"These are nice but seem to run a bit on the smaller size.  My son wears a 7 slim and while the waist fits the pant length is almost too small, its right on the ankles.  Overall its nice though"
"Beautiful top.... I weigh 145 pounds 5.5"" us 10 which was an XL chinese size and it fit perfectly......very pleased"
Good fabric and thread. Its not see through or too thin. I like these very much. Wish it came in a bigger size option instead of one size fit all.
Good Sunglass I recommend it.
Great jeans at a very reasonable price.
"At 5'9"", this hoodie in medium fits me like it does on the model in the picture.  I purchased other Alternative items though and the fits were all different.  Thinner Alternative hoodies required me to size down to avoid a pajama-loose hoodie. This one though is true-to-size.  With more color choices than the norm and a fair amount of sales here--I caught it for $22 and think that's justified given the current options from comparable (fitted) brands--it can hit a good price/benefit point as a fitted casual hoodie that you won't make you look like you wandered out of a college dorm if you wear it out of the house.

Wouldn't expect this to last as your go-to hoodie and would also suggest sizing up if you're looking to this for a Rainy-Sunday-Couch-Hoodie, but it's solid enough for the (sale) price."
"OMG, this is the most adorable dress.  The colors are vibrant and my neice looks darling in it.  I will definately buy more Mud Pie products"
"I wish I had known about these shirts when I lived in Phoenix, Arizona.  They fit great and are made of a light material.  They are perfect for hot days when you don't want to be stuck in a t-shirt."
Fits well & comfortable!
Love the fit of these.
I love these shoes.  This is the first pair that I've owned and wish I had bought them sooner.  They are extremely light and easy to wear.  I love the fact that they can be sanitized.  Great shoe at a great price.
"Geared up for track season; bought for the 1600, 800, 400 and 400 medley relays...this season, I'm the boss"
Perfect fit for a 32DD!!! I love that it has no padding and the lace is very durable! =]
"Overall - Great boots. The tread/bottom of the shoe on the heel is a bit slippery. The ankle is a bit wide, overall good for a wider calf. I have narrow feet and the fit perfectly. I also was able to wear them all day without any pain. They are very good looking!"
The sizing is just right. You can trust the ratings on this one. Very well made for the price. Nice jacket--no regrets.
Wonderful top I really like the color!!
"I have them in tan, grey & white. Very comfortable & well made- excellent value! Definitely recommend these to others"
"Love the deep pockets to hold change and dollar bills when on-board ships, where it is so easy to lose things."
nice quality and fit. will order this brand again. true to size.
These shoes are very nice. Dressy and comfortable!! I just recovered from plantar facii**** and these are shoes that will make you feel feminine without the pain of a high heel. HIGHLY recommend!!!!
Some what smaller than a normal XLT shirt but overall its nice and fits well love the color ;)
This sweater is stylish & well-fitting.
Solid pair for the price.
These boots are cute and lightweight. And my son seems to be able to maneuver in them better than other rain boots he's owned.  They're also very easy for my son to get on and off.
An amusing gift for a women who golfs.
My favorite shoe.  Most comfortable shoe I have ever worn..
"i got these based on the other reviews saying how narrow they run (and the price was very good!). i have a  small and narrow foot so it's hard to find slip-on shoes that fit well.  i found these shoes to be just a tad bit more narrow than the average shoe, but not by much.  my feet still slide around in them. however, since  i use them as house shoes i am keeping them as they are very comfortable and perfect for my hard floors."
"I love these socks. It was actually somewhat challenging to find socks with cushioning, breath-ability and heel tabs.
These are seriously comfortable and soft.
The price does include only one pair, which might not be worth it for some.
I personally don't mind spending extra for performance socks. High quality socks are important for exercising!"
Just love their crew socks!
It's a great shirt. Not thin and almost transparent like some white shirts. Easy to iron and fits great.
Very sturdy and well made.  It should last a long time.  I really like the loop for hanging this shoe horn from a hook on  my bedroom door.
"Cuteness! Love it! It is very soft, and well made!"
Used as a gift and the girl cried!
"Ordered black 71/2. I have been looking for $20 pair of black shoes and I found these wedges. I used to have the Madden Girl Ursey wedges and I loved them so I wore them a lot and they finally ripped after so much wear and tear. Anyways, I was delighted to find these b/c they look similar. Besides the patent material, these have a little bit of an almond toe, but it's a wider than normal almond toe. I have semi flat feet and I have used them for all day work wear and they have been comfortable. I also have a long second toe and they don't bother me. The shoes may not work for you if you have wide feet unless you don't care about having the side bulge. I have it a little bit but it might just be me and it's prob not noticeable to other people. I also find that the shoe covers my toes completely. I just have a tiny bit of pinky and 4th toe cleavage and then the rest are covered. I think the Madden Girl shoes had more toe cleavage. These have now been moved into my regular shoe rotation. I like simple black pumps that I can wear with anything and these wedges are that. Look great with slacks, skinny jeans, capris, and crop pants and dresses."
"I love, love, love these shoes.  Have been wearing them for years in several different colors so when I got ready to buy a black pair I just ordered the same size.  I was very surprised when they didn't fit and the others pairs that I have did.  Returned and reordered the next size up and they seem fine.  Slightly different feel but still incredibly comfortable.  Can be hard to find a shoe that is cute and comfortable at the same time."
Great material. He loves this shirt! Seems to be great quality!
I ended up going back to Hanes after trying a number of other brands and styles.  I would be happier if the sizes didn't cover such a wide range so the fit would be just a little bit better.
"My husband has worn this style jacket for many years. He loves it. But I made the mistake and ordered the wrong size. I had to return it, and wanted to replace it with the correct size but it was not available. Will order again when their stock is replenished."
Very comfy bra. Great fit!
I am super picky about shoes and was very nervous buying these online. I purchased them anyway because all my other merrell shoes fit well in the same size I ordered. The boots are waterproof and cute. I absolutely love these for snow days and they have held up nice to the salt and slush.
"my husband has been having trouble with his running shoes of late-- the last three pairs lasted less than 6 months each, with normal use( walking dog, running errands, kids to school).  As a runner, I have had good experiences with my ghost shoes in the past, and decided to order a pair.  So far, he is very pleased.  Very comfortable for his needs, both on the treadmill and running errands.  Only time will tell if they hold up better, but so far, so good..."
Daughter Christmas present.  She loves these shoes.
Adorbs. Soft. Seasonally perfect...
These are nice hard bottom shoes that add a little flair with the strap. These shoes seem to scuff up easily. I don't recall bumping into anything and by the time I got home the shoes were scuffed up all over. Nothing a little polish can't handle but still.
Excellente' senor!
a little shear but I love it
"Really pretty on, I am 59 180, and I bought an xlarge due to length reviews being short on taller women. It hits past my ankles which is what I was looking for. It fits so comfortably and lightweight feeling! Will definitely order more!"
Love these! For some reason it's impossible to find baby socks that stay on. These actually work! Make sure to safety pin them together when washing because they love to hide in other articles of clothing and get lost. I wish they weren't so expensive otherwise I'd buy several .
I love this necklace!!!!!!! It's so delicate and beautiful:) also much cheaper than other places!!!
"I would recommend buying from this seller, and these shoes to all my friends and family."
This is a great watch for the price. But i just wish it was maybe 40mm. The colors are amazing and it tells time so it works just as intended which is why i cant give it less than a 4 star.
"This automatic winder is super quiet! You can't even tell it's on if you have other noise in the room, such as a TV or radio. Without any background noise, it's still super quiet, and you really have to put your ear near it to hear anything. It's also a great presentation for your watches while winding. However, I did dock one star for the bulkiness of the casing, I don't think it's necessary for the casing to be as big as it is (check the size specs ahead of time, I didn't look at them before purchasing). But my boyfriend says it's of the normal size that a watch winder should be. I just expected it to be smaller and slimmer."
Adorable!  My two year old LOVES his robe!
I like this shoe very much. It fits nicely and worth the money. The finishings are very beautiful and nice materials
Very happy with the feel and fit. Also Amazon service is the best! Makes my shopping a little too easy maybe. But all good!
"I typically avoid boonie hats because they fit too close and look goofy. This one fits nice, looks great, has mesh vents and a nice wide brim with the dark (non glare) fabric underneath. I love it. It should be great for kayaking. Obviously in wind, need to cinch and strong winds take it off. I usully wear OR hats (sombriolet)..but this one is nice too. One of these days I might get A WHITE ONE to wear with sundresses."
HOLIDAY GIFT
Seriously comfortable shoes. This is my second pair.
"excellent brand, the do the best underwear I have ever used. most of my underwear are from hanes, they just do excellent products!"
They seem to run big.  The shoe is bulky but comfortable
"I found this style of Toms to run large. I have a regular pair of canvas Toms that are a size 7.5 and they fit great. But these glitter style seem to run big. I returned the 7.5 and got a 7, and they are perfect. I wore them for one day so far and they are very comfy and are already molding to my foot."
"I had read several reviews of Sbicca shoes prior to buying these, and some of them were a little varied.  For the most part, people liked them, though, so I decided to take a chance, and these were on sale.  I'm so glad I tried them!
I love these shoes.  They're cute and look great with a casual skirt, shorts or jeans.  The first day I wore them, I couldn't believe how comfortable they were.  They don't rub me anywhere, and the heel height compared to the platform height makes them easy to walk in all day.  Plus, I got several compliments on them.  Almost everyone who commented on them talked about how cute they were, and how comfortable they looked, too and I""m in total agreement.
I'm adding Sbicca to my list of favorite shoe brands!"
they were all that we expected
I like the boots but they run small. I suggest ordering a half size larger
Holding up so far . Washes nice
"It is okay for the price that I paid for. The fabric is a bit towards the transparent side which I don't like, but I guess I could try to fix it somehow. Also, it's a bit on the large side for me."
best purse I have ever owed! I get daily compliments on it and its super cute! use it more than any of my designer bags!  very well constructed cross body!
"Slightly bulky, but it works great.  I love that it has kg/lb options and turns itself off (however, beware where you keep it in your suitcase because it can easily turn itself on and make a digital sound if something gently presses up against it in your bag).  Still, with the ridiculous baggage fees some airlines charge, I will never travel without this scale!!"
Purchased for my daughter for Halloween. She loved it!  It was a perfect fit!
"I love this beautiful dress. Looks better in person, the picture does not do just. The color is very vibrant. But the lining is terrible. It looks feel rough and looks like a cheap laundry bag from the dollar tree. And it is way too short too, almost upto the bikini line. But cut off the whole lining and used one of the slip dresses I have."
Great value and very warm!
I knew it would be small based on reviews. I wear 7 in pants 34D top and large fit great so cute great quality  and  great price!!!
Worn as a Thanksgiving shirt in Southern California. Nice quality.
"Bought for my granddaughter Christmas 2014 -- just now reviewing! They are adorable and came in time for Christmas. She loves them. The glitter is covered with clear plastic, so no worries of leaving a trail of glitter everywhere she goes. There is a nice padding in the back of the heel and the lining seems comfortable. I don't remember if these actually have an arch support built into the insole but I do remember thinking this looked like a higher end shoe on the inside, not a cheap knock-off, and looked comfortably padded. The rosette on top is beautiful and has the sparkly ""jewels"" on top that seemed to be affixed pretty well, maybe even sewn into the rosette. I hope this was helpful."
"The dress is really cute and arrived quickly. It runs very small though, but as long as you follow the size chart provided it will be fine.  My daughter is 5 1/2 and a little taller than average and very thin. She needed the large, but I ordered the medium the first time by mistake. Return was of course simple with prime."
"Tahnyou again IZOD as usual I receive this purchase in very good conditions, I love the apeareance of the cloth and the soft in touch of the fabric"
Super soft and great quality.  I love using these as lounge or workout tanks.  I would definitely recommend them in every color.
Ordered these in brown and chocolate.  I Loved the chocolate and will keep them.  The brown color was more tan.  They are cute and comfy
"Three years later and I still love this shirt! I'm 5' 8"", skinny/average girl. I bought this in XL and I love how it fits. I'm obsessed with dragons and love baggy shirts so this is pretty amazing."
"It is really hard for me to find a good fitting bra that has the support I need and want. Came across this bra and I must say I like! The wide straps add the extra comfort us big boobie girls need. The price is awesome in comparison to other retailers. I saw the Madonna bra reviews and took the chance. They are kinda pointy at first, but after a few wears/washes that went away but the support is still really good. Ordering a few more!"
"Cute socks, very comfy. Wear them while running and cycling and these feel way better than my usual socks. They also fit my small feet which I usually have a hard time finding socks that fit correctly."
"Comfy and cute.  Maybe just a tad larger than the average, but not enough to be bothersome.  I like that they are sturdier than most slippers I've had in the past."
Just as described A++++++
This necklace is to cute! People actually think it's a real camera!
Good shoes and very comfortable!
"Best tutu croniline skirt of them all. Does run small. I have a 34"" waist and a Medium fit perfectly. Gives a nice ""poof"" to any swing skirt!!!"
These are the best. I have another set and used them for the first time on a trip and what a joy. Changed hotels 5 times and never had to unpack and always knew where my things where. I just ordered this set for my husband to use on our next trip
"Hav not played golf wearing these shoes yet but look forward to doing so soon. They r very lightweight, comfortable nd good looking shoes. They come with an extra pair of color contrasting laces, not a huge deal but nice"
"Love this hoodie.  It has bright colors on the sleeves and hood, fits perfectly (medium) when I usually wear a small.  I ordered this one size up because I know this material shrinks somewhat and I am glad I did. Also, did not want a tight fitting hoodie.  I have washed it twice already in cold water and dry medium and it has held its size and shape.  Not your average looking sweat shirt.  I just love it."
"No Issues with this product, it gets the job done."
Ru a little small compared to other pants that I buy
"Perfect for a Saturday out and about, lightweight, easy on strap, real leather and the price cannot be beat! 5 Stars!"
"I love them, very comfortable, and I will buy some for my wife."
I  love this hat. It has a wire built into the brim edge which helps it to hold its shape.
"Great jeans, so soft and comfortable. A true white which is exactly that I wanted.the amount of stretch allows for easy movement."
Love them. They are white though. So you know they will get dirty. Find a good way to clean them. Very comfortable.
Love it.. a little long on me at 5'4. I will buy more. It is comfy and modest but form fitting enough to be flattering.
Love it-had a hard time finding one with a hood-great color!
"Love the cut of this dress.  Very flattering.  Cotton was a bit stiff when i first got it, but better after a wash.  I highly recommend it as a great go to piece."
Love these! Keep everything organized
I bought this as a Xmas gift for a friend of mine but it looks like just what she wanted and it's really very pretty.
"I chose 5 stars because the earrings look great, are light to wear, and don't overwhelm your outfit and the price was excellent.
There are no negatives with these earrings.
I highly recommend them."
Beautiful dress better then I expected
Perfect school socks my 5-year old.
Love them and for the price no complaints.
Love reef flip flops (sandals) Will not buy or try any other brand.
"Just as pictured, beautiful suit! Works well for short torso unlike so many one piece suits.  Sewn in thin cup layer I love. Straps are set very wide as shown so not for the narrow shouldered. Very flattering sweetheart neckline for a big A/small B cup. Butt provides decent coverage but a flat butt will not hold it in place, borderline for me. Tummy panel does not control but provides just enough shirring to help conceal a bit. Also happy to say it does not cause underarm bulges. Only rating a 4 because I cannot imagine this working for a taller average torso person, I am 5'3"
the shoes are just fine
"Very nice, and you can carry all of your electronics when wearing medieval gear! This is a bit pouch."
"My wife love everything about this dress, from the fit to the material. The color is amazing!"
I bought this for my 12 year old daughter it fits her like a size 14 girls
"It's a great shirt, but I only wish it came in others colors."
"I bought two of these for a midnight 5K that my daughter and I are running today.  I bought them three months ago and they are still working well even though we haven't even run the 5K yet!  I was worried about buying them so far in advance (I didn't want the LEDs to go out or stop working), but despite my daughter wearing hers all the time, they still work.  Our 5K is next weekend and while I'm nervous about being too hot in the jacket (after all, the 5K is in August in South Carolina - there's not exactly a need for a JACKET), I think it will be fun."
"My husband really appreciates this hat ..... we have been working a lot outside in the sun and nothing ever seems to fit his noggin but this does!!

It is adjustable so I can even wear it - I can very much recommend this hat"
Worn two years in a row cuz he loved it so much.  He outgrew the hat but everything held up to two years of school parties and carnivals and random wearing of it around the house.  The design lets him wear warm clothes underneath comfortably.
Best out there.
"Breathable, can fit over a wide calf (17inches) comfortably, and washes up nicely without shrinking....great buy"
Fits well except the torso portion was a bit short on one pair and long on a second pair.
I honestly loved the set ! It made me happy bc I got more that I'd expected ! && all the charms were sooo cute !
I love these socks because they don't fade!  Very comfortable! I also bought the womens version and they are my favorites socks to wear with pants/jeans/leggins!
"The shorts are what I expected, given past experience with carhartt.  The other reviewer was right about it being long enough for tall guys.  I am pretty tall, and the length is perfect in that it covers my legs all the way to the knees, but not below.  I carry a limited number of tools, and a telephone, and constantly get in and out of a vehicle, for my job and these have very well designed pockets for carrying a few hand tools, out of the way so they don't stab the truck seat.  The truly unique and excellent features of carhartt are attention to detail, and sparing no expense for quality.  However, I hope I haven't spoken too soon, as we shall see how long they last."
Great support. Very comfortable.
"My son loves these! He especially loves the fabric and it's ""fuzzy"" nature."
"IS TOO SMALL TO EXPECTET, BUT VERY PRODUCT"
"I managed to get a hole in mine rather early, but these are very comfortable, very silky, and pretty."
"Great quality. Beautiful jewelry. No tarnish. No green on the skin. Im hypersensitive yo most metals, but this brand hasn't affected my skin at all. Will buy more!"
On time..soft and comfortable fabric.
One of my favorite Patty shirts.
Great grandkid gift. Be sure to secure the backpack straps out of the way to avoid damage.
"works great no problems, pretty durable. not sure what else you can say about a good cheap watch. would buy again."
"They're a lot stiffer than I have experienced with other DocMartens.  I was a little unhappy with that, but with some wear I'm sure they'll be great."
"Great quality, I deliberately ordered a size too big as I have gain some weight in my hips and butt :) nice fit after alterations"
Amazing hat. Great quality. Great company!!!
"I purchased these foldable rain boots for an upcoming trip to England. I tried them on over shoes and the sole was wide enough while the length has a little extra in the front (I wear a 6M). The zipper worked fine and the top snapped snugly around my pants at mid-calf, so I think they will stay up. So far so good. I believe they will be fine for emergency rain gear, but I won't know how they hold up in use until I use them. Update to come ..."
Cute and good quality socks!
"Although I wouldn't recommend these for like an all day walk about (because the soles are so flat-not much support) these are really rather comfy! Feel great, breathe well, look stylish. Only thing I'm not a fan of is that the buckles make sounds as I walk. I prefer to be a little more stealth..."
A little small in shoulders n but other than that fit good.
Good fit. Prompt shipment.
Great product.  But please check the size dimensions first.  Bought this for Girlfriend and it was just too big for her.  Returned it but not knocking the product because of that.
"Plan on getting a size larger! This skirt is fabulous for what it is intended for - the bedroom or an ""adult"" party! Do not wear it in public but, if you want to wear it someplace intimate, you will definitely get the reaction you are looking for!  This skirt is HOT!"
"I can't say enough about how useful a shemagh can be in hotter climates.  I keep at least one of these handy in my camping/survival gear for many reasons:

- Keeps you cool when it is wet, either worn just around the neck or wrapped around your head
- Makes a great arm sling
- Can be used as a camp towel or wash rag
- Could be used as a tourniquet in an emergency
- Makes a great bandage wrap for a big wound
- Keeps the sun off your head/neck
- Can be used to pre-filter mucky water that you need to prep for drinking
- Partial head/neck camouflage
- Protects my neck during paintball play while keeping me cool

I keep finding more and more uses for this shemagh.  I now own 4 different colors.  They are easy to wash, and you just let them air dry.  Instructions say to machine wash cold on a delicate cycle or hand wash, and air dry only.  Wring it out, let it air dry for less than a half hour fully opened up, and it's dry and clean."
"I am VERY happy with these shorts, i could not find them at any local store and at that price. Keep it up Amazon."
This bra holds up nicely after hand washing and feels very comfortable. I purchased several of them actually.
"Great, soft and wonderful for travel."
"These Freshwater Cultured Pearl Button Stud Earrings by EVER FAITH are nice! These earrings are well made and seem to be nice quality. They are handpicked freshwater cultured pearls. The metal is 925 sterling silver. I like that because it's not irritating for my sensitive ears.

These earrings are really nice looking. They can be worn with casual or dress clothes. They are an off white creamy color and they look nice with everything. The earrings come in separate sealed plastic baggies to keep them from rubbing against each other and maybe getting scratched. They are in a nice box and also come with a soft drawstring bag and a polishing cloth. This is a very nice pair of pearl earrings that would also make a great gift.

I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions are based on my own experiences."
Very cute boots.  The elastic is somewhat tight but they do slide on pretty easily.  My grand daughter seemed to be comfortable in them but she only had them on for a couple of hours.
this dress is super cute.  Can dress it up or down.  I actually ordered it again in another color.
"I have worn Magnum boots for 17 years due to their comfort.  I work 10 hour shifts and spend lots of time on my feet with a 20+ pound duty belt on my waist.  They have changed something in the boot.  Previous Magnum boots I could go a full shift and my feet were fine.  This pair I can feel my feet by the end of my shift, otherwise this would be a 5 star boot."
"These boots fit my daughter perfectly, and are VERY comfortable and she loves them so much that she wears them every other day. On the off days she wears her black pair. What more is there to say? Oh, they're durable and after weeks of wear appear as if they just came out of the box!"
Adorable! has a tiny black heart shaped cutout in one of the green shamrocks that I couldn't tell from the pic.  Generously sized. Very cute and flattering.
"Very nice look, very classy.  Comfortable, too."
"I like these sunglasses a lot. They work well with my round/square face (depending on who you ask). They are comfortable. They come with a cloth microfiber bag/ drawstring case that works well for cleaning, but doesn't offer any protection. They fold relatively (but not totally) flat. They seem good quality, though not totally scratch/impact resistant, as I have already managed to get a couple dings in the lenses after just a month, but nothing too bad."
Pretty though not quite as stunning as I expected.
These are the best booties I have ever purchased.  I am going to purchase another set in beigen
Arrived on time and fits perfectly and looks like the picture.
"A very nice and very light walking shoe. Normally I wear a 9 1/2 or 10. but when I reorder another Skecher shoe it will be a 10 1/2, the size 10 is a little tight in the toes.
 I do recommend and will buy more of this product."
"I went to Europe with just a small roller carryon and a backpack. I'm so glad I bought this and packed it in my carryon at the last minute because naturally, I came home with way more than I left with. I love how compact this product is when it's folded up. It wasn't a hassle to bring it with as it barely took up any extra room.

I was even able to use it as my ""personal item"" and put my empty backpack, clothes I had bought on the trip, and souvenirs in it on the flight back home. It was a total life saver to have that extra room on the way back. It's durable and could have carried way more than I had put in it. Would definitely recommend."
Very bright blue and fit very nicely
XG is smaller than expected
Purchased as a gift. Recipient was delighted. Good Product.
Nice shoes but developed a hole by the big toe area after about 3 month. Fits great and looks really nice
Love this light weight rain jacket
Good size and can take the impact of some pretty stiff winds.
Bought these for my elderly mom who is very picky and she loves these.  The quality is outstanding and she loves the memory  foam/get sole.  This price point is awesome.  You won't be disappointed if you buy these.
I still wear it though.
These are wonderful!  Comfortable and run true to size.
"Alas there is more of me than there used to be, but the duck material is not as heavy as the pair they replace."
"Well made, nice bright clean colors.  Sleeves cute.  I love it so much I'm ordering another one!"
"I can see based on how much slack a button on a shirt has can stress these button holes on the plastic stay.  Overall I have used these nearly every day and love them when outside on a breezy/windy day.  Sure, the lower 1/3 to 1/2 may still flop around but that's acceptable to me.  However, I have a few ties that no longer have a complete tag loop on the back to allow these tie stays to work so I am also going to get a traditional tie clip preferablly a magnetic one.  The two items should be all I need.  But these work great!!!"
Essential firm control tank.
"I was looking for a nice classic leather belt that will wear well with jeans and other casual pants. I stumbled across this one, and went ahead and ordered a large (I'm a size 6/8). The leather has held up very well, and it does not seem as prone to bending in the back middle as some of my previous belts (bonded leather) have done in the past. It fits very comfortably, and keeps me from constantly tugging my jeans up, as they start to slide down my hips after I've worn them for a bit.

This belt looks very smart with a pair of black jeans and a sweater. I love that I can transition a jeans belt to slacks and have it adapt to the outfit. It doesn't draw a lot of attention, but that wasn't what I was looking for in this belt. The price is only slightly more than the cheap belts that they sell in many stores, but I can tell that it is made out of leather and not the bonded crud that starts to crack and fall apart after a few wears. I will say that this belt has made me keen to try other belts from this brand and I would highly recommend this.

As an Amazon customer, I know how annoying and difficult it is when reviewers cant be trusted. So, I would like to say that whenever I provide any reviews I always take my time and make sure I understand and have used the product in order to give an educated review. It's important to note here that I received this product at discounted price for my honest and unbiased review. Still I try my best to provide all the useful details in the review rather than misrepresenting a products quality in order to please a seller and I know good sellers always look for true feedback.

I did receive this product at a discounted price or free in exchange for a fair and honest review, we take our time and study each product before we leave a review and are strongly thoughtful when we leave a review, we are very pleased with this item and feel that it's a great value that you will be pleased with as well, we appreciate you taking the time to read this and we hope it will help in your buying decisions, thanks again and have a great rest of the day !!!"
"This is absolutely adorable on, and it is thin enough for my daughter to use in her carseat while still staying warm.  I think it may keep her a little too warm (she is pretty warm blooded), but overall, this is a great option for people that want something their child can wear in a carseat since puffy winter coats are not safe in car seats."
My 6 year old boy loves these. So easy for him. Very durable and strong.  Exactly what I hoped for.
"More comfortable to me than any other Vibrams, very nice fabric good protection underneath and overall good fit."
This worked great for our middle school production of The Wizard of Oz!  Very good quality hat for the price.
This is my third pair over many years and I love them.
comfortable shorts. i could sleep all day wearing them.
"This is a great watch for the price.  Like another reviewer, I also prefer easily read numbers to Roman numerals - or worse yet, plain linear graduation marks for each hour.  The large black numbers on the white face provide good contrast; it's very easy to see the time on this watch.  I also like the expansion band better than leather other bands that need buckles.  Furthermore, it's very accurate.  I've had the watch for several months now and it still has exactly the correct time according to the time.gov website.  One drawback is that the watch case is somewhat large.  If you have a small wrist it might look too big.  Luckily, my wrist is big enough so it's not an issue.  It's also a little tricky to shorten the band.  You need a good tweezers, a small jeweler's screwdriver (to release the spring pins), and a small needle-nose pliers would help.  With these tools and some patience you can do it yourself."
Great boot for new walker. I just wish the toe was a little thicker. He bumps his front foot often so the leather comes off quickly.
"I stated that they fit as expected, and they did, but I wear 48 X 32 in dress slacks, and Levi Jeans 46 X 30 fit well.
So, yes they fit as I expected them to fit, one size smaller than dress slacks.
The quality is good, they wear well, but they are expensive for Made in Mexico products.
If I bought allot of these, I think that I would look elsewhere."
I got it a while ago but never had a chance to review. It is a good looking piece but I do not like the earrings. I would say not too bad for the money I spent. Will take a picture to let you be the judge..  :)
fantastic gift for a little girl
"These shoes are perfect....size, comfort, look great all I wanted.  No break in time needed I just wore them and will buy another pair!"
"Got these for my husband....he loves them. Based on that, I would recommend these.  He is 6'4"" and the length is perfect - just above his knees but not the big baggy shorts so many places sell.  I hate those!!!  These are much nicer looking."
This shirt is as cute as could be but I should have ordered a size larger.  It was slightly snug and has shrunk enough that it barely fits after only a couple months. But that is not a negative against the shirt appeal at all. It is very cute.
Wear these at least once a week. Currently my favorite boot.
This brand fits better and slips less than other brands I've tried.
"I have received many compliments when wearing this shirt. It's unusual and goes well with many casual outfits. I really like Neon Buddha and find their things very comfortable and easy to wear. Pricey, but worth it for how well the clothing is made and how many compliments you get when wearing."
"Love it, it's comfortable and fits the way it should without riding up or rolling down or whatever else throughout the day. The material is soft as well which is nice"
Great polo and ditto price as well as great delivery.
"nice shoes! Very pretty, very feminine feel even though the heel is not that high. This is a good, stable feeling heel for anyone that loves the look of heels but cannot do high heels."
Good quality print and make. Seems hasn't start giving way even after quite a few washes.
I use it as an alternative to a bra its comfortable fits as expected but is a little on cheap quality side
"I bought these for my son. He loves them! He said they keep his feet warm and dry and he trekked for days in them and was comfortable the entire time. Good deal, and he's happy, so it's a win,win!"
"Perfect fit, true to size, and lovely quality. The fabric is like satin and is wearing well. Looks like the photo."
Wasn't sure what a leather necklace would look like and I am glad I bought it. It goes great with natural stone pendants. I have some irritation from metal necklaces even the ones silver and gold so this is a great addition to my necklaces.
I couldn't have asked for a better looking necklace. It's beautiful and looks elegant. The only thing I would change is the claspe. Make it a longer lonsyer claw lock.
Great ring. Very beautiful. Extremely comfortable to me. Feels much lighter than I expected in a good way. Most of the time I forget I even have it on.
i have been wearing this chain constantly for over a year!
"Fits great, washes well, holds color great.  JMS is a great brand for plus size women."
"Warm, comfortable, great color. Fits but would have liked it just a little bit bigger. Might not order again, unless it goes on sale."
"These are very comfortable. I require arch supports normally, and this shoe provides an adequate amount of support. I had a pair of Teva's before and the hard triangular plastic pieces on the side were uncomfortable after a while. These sandals do not have that issue and are very soft."
"I ordered a medium instead of a small based on prior reviews. I did not need to go up a size. I don't think it runs as small as some claim. THe medium is not sloppy on me, but I definitely could have stuck with my normal small. None the less, great looking shirt."
These are very nice boots. We have had them a couple months and they seem to be holding up well to my rough 8 year old. I love the design of the boot and that they can be dressed down and worn with a tee shirt or dressed up and worn with nice button up shirts. My little boy is flat footed so we added some arch supports and they fit him well. He wears them almost everyday and says they are very comfortable.
I bought these to wear while doing P90X. While they ran a little small (I typically wear a size 8.5 and had to return for a size bigger) they work well for P90X. They are very stable for all the Plyometrics training and weight lifting. I would recommend.
good belt. holds my pants up. also hook my knife and work pager and badge to it. cant complain.
"This bracelet is elegant and beautiful. The hue of the bracelet looks very close to fine jewelry. It does not look like costume jewelry at all. The only adverse thing about it is the width. It is small for my wrist. So if are slimmer than my size 18, it should be okay. I think it should be treated to clear nail varnish too, so it won't change color.
*Item got at a discount for my honest review*"
"Thebottom button is challenged a bit by my belly. I know, I should lose weight. but I buy shirts like this so I don't have to! When the bottom button keeps coming undone, or just sort of seems to hang up a little, the shirt did not leave enough room, IMHO."
"The price is excellent, they look
and catch the light like real opals.  The backs however, swelled up my ear lobe. The posts did not.  A switch to gold backs solved the problem."
My one year old grandson loves these boots.  He brings them from the front hall and asks to have them put on.
"Bought one for my daughter's vampire costume, and a second one because I knew her brother would be super jealous and want one. Everyone is very happy. Super cute and good quality."
awesome ring....fast shipping
"My wife loves them, really well made."
"I am in love with this purse! It is very large which I love, being a mom I'm always carrying a ton of stuff. This seems to be very good quality material. I love that it has pockets on the front and back of the purse. Also it has a zipper pocket inside, and 2 smaller pockets. I would def buy from this company again."
"Best nursing tanks in the world.  padded, but not overtly so, netting on inside of bra area to keep any leaks away from your skin."
love this belt!! Perfect!
"If there were pockets, and suspenders I would rate this a 5 star."
Nice belt a little bigger than I thought but made it work.  Clip is easy to use and overall very durable
"This is a perfectly gorgeous jacket, and the fake leather really looks and feels convincing. I'd say that this jacket runs TRUE TO SIZE, Hillfiger products are usually cut generously, that has been my experience in the past. My hubby adores this jacket and appreciates the fact that there's no ""cow smell"" as is common with leather jackets especially in the Summer when it gets warm.

This jacket has a classic look and appeal with bomber jacket styling. It's waterproof too,which is super handy if you get caught out in a storm and don't want to ruin your nice leather jacket. It fits really well and is generously cut in the shoulder area, a benefit for my hubby who likes to lift weights and has a larger upper back region due to athletics. The sleeves are perfect as well, niether too short or too long.  This is a hip looking, and sexy jacket particularly for the over 40 crowd. It's classy and simply ""feels good on"" as he says. I ordered one size larger so that he can comfortably wear his favorite sweaters underneath, and I'm glad I did this jacket in XL is perfect and has a bit of extra room for comfort.  5 stars, highly recommended!"
"I thought these would look too much like bowling shoes, but I actually really like how they look in person. Very stylish, durable, and easy to lace. Fits as expected."
just as advertised and top quality leather!!
Beautifully made shoe and fits me just right.  I usually wear an 8.5 or 9 and the 9 in this shoe is perfect.  I look forward to wearing it on an upcoming trip.
Super nice top. Perfect to wear for a formal office type...
Very well made. Thin seams. Very comfortable!
"The Peet Odor Eliminator is the sort of product that deep down you know you need. I had the perfect subject in mind....my husband's 20 year old hiking boots.

Once I received the Odor Eliminator, I went searching for the culprits, and finally found them isolated in the back of a deep closet. I nabbed them while inhaling and holding my nose. Yuk!

The first thing you notice about the Peet Odor Eliminator is that it looks like a pair of binoculars gone terribly wrong.

The second thing you notice is that you need four size ""C"" batteries (not included.) Not to fret, there is an AC adapter so batteries are not obligatory.

The instructions are extremely clear: insert an ""arm"" into each stinky shoe (or glove, hat, or whatever), turn the gizmo on and wait anywhere from 1-6 hours, depending on the ""odor type and situation.""

Quickly assessing the hiking boots, I guessed that 6 hours would probably not be enough, but certainly worth a try.

Using the highly scientific ""sniff test"" of my own devising (bending close to the subject and quickly inhaling through my nose) I came up with a sniffabiliy score of 1-10 with 1 being pleasant and 10 being the worst thing you ever experienced.

Prior to the start of treatment with the Odor Eliminator, the boots were awarded a 10.

After 15 minutes = 8 (Still disgusting but not capable of causing loss of consciousness)
1 hour= 6 (Nasty, just nasty)
2 hours=5 (Unpleasant)
3 hours=4 (Stinky but in the normal range of stinky)
6 hours=2 (Someone has worn this boot recently but did not perspire excessively and had very clean feet)

It was at this point that my husband came into the room and said ""what are my hiking boots doing out and what is that thing inside them?""

To me, a score of 2 is realistic for footwear and I didn't go for an additional 6 hour treatment. Besides, keeping the boots out for up to 12 hours seemed excessive. It also seems that periodic treatment would help maintain the boots in the ""normal"" range.

I also tried the Peet Odor Eliminator on a pair of my sandals. I inserted the arms of the device into my sandals which were placed into a partially closed paper bag so that the O3 would be able to flow around the insole and not immediately escape. I found that two hours of treatment was sufficient for a decent result.

It is important to note that this is not a fast solution for smelly problems, but it is a good solution if you are willing to spend four to six hours."
"Very luxe sheeps wool. Thick and attractive looking slippers. Purchased for16 year old and he likes their appearance. I really like them, happy with purchase and would definitely recommend!"
Very useful for newborns. My daughter has a happit of scratching her face. These help her protect against that. Just that these are a little bigger in size for newborns but I had sewn them a little bit so that it fits her. The only thing I did't like much was the material used to make them.
I like them ever better in person that in the picture!
Fits my wide foot perfectly
Beautifully made but for a 2 year old. I bought for my 1 year old and it's huge. I'm going to clasp the back and make it work for her pictures.
"This sandal fits a little too snug ; however I bought them to go to water parks ; therefore they are perfect for this.  They don't slip and slide off your feet when wet.  After you wear them a few times they fit better on your feet when dry.  At first they leave a small blister on your foot on the back strap ; but after you break them in they don't leave a blister anymore.  Kathy Castleberry, Tampa, Florida"
"Love these shoes!  I have them in grey, black/white, and blue/white.  They are light-weight and so comfortable!  I throw them in the wash and hang dry, and they come out good as new."
"I can wear them conformably for hours.  I have flat feet, so I don't fault the shoes.  Nice look."
"Awesome watch, I would never waste my money on Casio g-shocks again"
Solid built accurate automatic timepiece bought 7 watches !
Earns 4 stars because I hate wearing a bra but it is comfortable
"I liked the look and feel of these shoes, but ended up returning them because they were far too snug around the arch of my foot. My foot doesn't need to feel like it is getting a constant hug from my shoe. Also the toe box wasn't as wide as in some other barefoot-esque shoes I've tried. I ended up with the Vivobarefoot Stealth."
I love this is suit and get so many compliments!
"Mine came today and I immediately tried them out on the treadmill. They felt sturdy enough and are comfy, not to mention quite gorgeous on the feet.  I ordered an 8 wide, and the size is perfect.  I run a few times a week, no heavy mileage, and I'm also on my feet ALL day running errands, working at my kid's school, just...everything. I do wear orthotics and these shoes are pretty low compared to my last pair of New Balance running shoes.  So I had to remove the liner which had a padded heel cushion which if worn with my orthotics, raises my foot too high making it feel like my heel is coming out. I inserted the liner from my last New Balance shoes (which does NOT have a heel cushion), placed my orthotics over that and voila!  Perfect.  Also you can't beat the price here on Amazon.  I tried the same pair at the actual New Balance store (which did not carry it in wide width and would've needed to be ordered and take up to 10 days to receive ) and they would've cost me $80. I think these will work for a while.  Happy so far!"
"all ok, I arrive in the stipulated time."
"Nice, solid twill capris but don't be mislead by the stetch claim. They are definitely not stretch. They fit as expected, a little snug when pulling them up but good fit once on the waist. Made of classic Dickies cotton twill and they feel very durable. My girlfriend bought these as work pants but she will probably get some use out of these while hiking or kayaking, too."
"I love this style of skechers.  This is my second pair, having worn the other pair out over the past year of regular wearing.  My husband bought a men's style to take on our vacation when we expected a lot of walking.  He likes his too."
"Well made, heavy, and will be great in cooler weather"
"Good deal, Good quality tennis"
The set is gorgeous and I received multiple compliments. The earrings are heavy enough that I had to remove them about once an hour to let me ears rest. I would wear it more often if it were weighted better.
I really haven`t worn this shoe enough to comment on comfort except to say I did have to use the dryer trick for stretching the straps. They do fit just fine now. I wanted a pair of navy blue sandals and these are the perfect co;or. I do need to wear them more but I got them to wear with a certain outfit that I haven`t worn yet. But I do like the shoe!
"These are ok, but my fiancs wide feet won't allow his feet to completely fit in the shoes"
"Perfect gift for a friend with ""gas"" issue and a good sense of humor."
This dress is beautiful and with the gloves that match is will be perfect.
Cool and sexy shoe. Comfortable too. But this weird thing happens occasionally while walking.. the tip of the shoe seems to catch the carpet every once in a while. I can't tell if it's just me or does anyone else experience this.. the shoe is so cute that I've been lifting my foot just a wee bit higher when I wear them cuz they are so darn cute! Fits good from heel to toe.. no overage in the front or back. I'm a true 9 and they fit perfectly
"This worked great underneath my daughter's Halloween costume. Just because her character is showing skin, doesn't mean my 5-year-old will be showing any. Great way to keep her covered and warm."
"Great price for a great quality jacket. Versatile, warm and water resistant. Sizing seems to still be an issue for Carhartt as I ordered a medium (based on reviews from other purchasers) and I usually wear a large. The medium fits pretty good, a hair snug but not uncomfortable. A large would have been way too big I think. If Carhartt offered a medium-plus, that would have been perfect, and I would have given it 5 stars. This jacket is warm too, and with lots of pocketsa good buy, if you can find the size that fits you.."
"Bought this for my fianc since I'm always schlubbing around in robes, and was shocked how much he loves it! ""Is this a man-robe"" he asked? WHy yes! So comfy, and fit is great I would buy him 6 more if he'd let me"
"I'm 6'6"" and have a 35"" inseam.  Finding pants that fit is tough.  I'm used to having to buy unfinished pants and have them hemmed at the tailor.  I'm so happy to have found unfinished scrubs that I can have altered and wear while on call at work rather than have to wander around the hospital in high-water scrubs.  Yeah, getting them hemmed costs as much as the scrubs themselves, but that's just life for really tall guys.  Instead of complaining about it, I wish all the negative reviewers would just be grateful that they don't have to go through this hassle every time they buy a pair of pants.  I also love all the pockets and the front zipper!"
"I'm usually an 8.5 or 9 so when I order online I usually just size up.  I would probably rather have the 8.5, but not enough to send them back and exchange sizes.  Otherwise the shoes are perfect.  They are comfortable and very cute."
"I have a pair of Dansko clogs that are my favorite shoes. Unfortunately, the finish does not allow for regular shoe polish (the polish actually removes MORE of the finish than adding anything to it).

I was so happy when I found this paint because I can now have my clogs look nice again! I've sprayed them with Black, Red and Navy Blue, and they've turned out great each time. With one coat it lasts for about 8 months before I start seeing scuff marks and need to redo it.

This is been a life-saver. I thought I was going to have to get rid of these shoes.

This will be the first time I'm purchasing this off Amazon. The first few times it was through my local shoe repair shop, which charged me twice the price. So, it'll be great to get it a little cheaper too."
Material is very cool and comfortable.
very sheer and classy. I like it a lot however I will wash it by hand when it needs it
"Bought this shirt for my husband and he loves it.  He wears it all the time.  He says its warm and very comfortable.  Stains come out very nicely and it washes great, no shrinkage or color bleeding.  It has been washed numerous times and still looks brand new."
"Adorable outfit for a newborn. The shirt is average to narrow, and the pants are average to wide, so the whole outfit is fine on an average size newborn."
Very clean and a good look.....made well and durable.
ordered wrong cup size...
"I absolutely love this ring! It shipped fast, I ordered a size 7 and it fit perfectly. I have received so many compliments and no one can tell it isn't real."
GIFT FOR MOMINLAW
Light weight shoe with hard foam soles. My 5 year old loves them.
"The size 36 pant legs are more for someone a bit over 6 foot vs my 5'9"", otherwise will be nice when the temps are  50 to 70 F."
Very good product guaranteed
nice boot fit great
"The picture shows a legging, this is not a legging, but regular capris pants. They were huge on me, but Amazon has amazing return policy."
My wife loves wearing these on her run and hike. The colors contrast nicely and are bright and look good. They match her work out outfit in a way that is cute and sexy.
"5'7, 160 lbs, perfect"
Great sandals I liked them more than the mick fannings  I had previously. Feel great and comfy.
Love the socks. I wear flip flops year round. Not to mention they are a good conversation item.
This is my 3rd pair of these sneakers. Really like them.  Would definitely buy again.
"Ok, ordered a large and it is definitely small. Not small enough I can't wear it as it was purchased for layering in the fall, but small enough I may have to sew some pretty lace onto the bottom. I'm 5'6 and about 140Lbs so if you're about that size, definitely order larger. All in all I would order again, top looks great and seems sturdy."
"My measurements are 34' 26' 36 and I'm 5'10"" I ordered the medium and it fit great. Not too loose and not too tight just like the picture. It was very stiff and rough when I pulled it out of the packaging, so I added fabric-softener (I washed it with  cold water on delicate/handwash but it would probably be fine on normal) and threw it in the dryer for ten minutes and no shrinking. I wasn't sure how it would turn out because there weren't any tags in English.
The material is thick and warm. I'm tall, so I was afraid the sleeves would be to short but they are perfect."
"Great looking, sturdy hoodie."
"I love this ring!  What a bargain for this price.  Mine looks just like the picture,  I think the most attractive thing about the ring is the simple setting- no cheap diamonds trying to make it look like something it's not- just a pretty stone in a very simple, unusual setting. I like it so much I may buy another in a different stone."
First time buying sorel slippers but I must say it won't be the last. What a comfortable shoe. I was worried as I had read from other reviewers that the lining comes apart and the stitching isn't a good quality. Well I am here to tell you that that is not so. I received these slippers  6 days ago and I have been wearing them constantly except when in bed. They are so comfortable and keep my feet so warm. I like the little heal in the back. It keeps my feet from slipping out of it. They fit true to size and the sole is non skid. No complaints with these slippers in fact I like them so well am going to order another pair.
"I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. He loves it. It has more pockets for cards than his last wallet, which he likes a lot. It arrived quickly, and it's exactly as described. Would buy again."
"Cute and comfy but seems to run big so had to go down a half of a size. Was worries with leather it stretching out as well. Nice height, non slip sole and nice cushioning."
"My husband works in a freezer and these socks along with the proper freezer boots work well for him. Not mde to be worn alone, under wool socks."
"I am a Nike kind of gal and really never tried any other brand. However, Nike's can be rather expensive and I needed some new sneakers and did not have the money for the ones I really wanted. So I thought I'd give New Balance a chance. They look stylish and heck they still had a ""N"" on it. lol. When I tried them on I was pleasantly surprised how comfortable they are. Now, I don't know the difference between walking, running, or what ever kind of shoe, I just go by what looks good to me. I have however started walking more and these are very comfortable and looks really good when I wear my jeans or jogging suits. So, from now on I won't look over NB shoes."
my wife feels like a punk rocker in these.
"I have worn Timberline Hikers for over 10 years. I wore the last ones 10 years until the soles separated and said goodbye.
I own a winter hiker pair and purchased these for my Saturday morning trail hikes with my dog. I have foot pain and need good protection and stabilization. I have tried other shoes but none fit and feel as good as Timberline. I have a super hiker acquaintance that  swears by Timberline hiking boots and got me started wearing them. I won't accept anything else. The quality is exceptional."
These are comfy and great for work outs!
This shirt I love! It is a great length so you can wear with leggings and it is very comfortable.
Bought this for my daughter as a gift and she truly adores it...it is simply beautiful
"Far better than I was anticipating! !! It was gorgeous,  shipped  super fast. It was a great value and was well made."
"Super cute hat and it's great to play dress up or for special events. My niece tried it on and she looked so adorable, but it is a little tight on my head (I was told I have a big head lol). The quality is also great and if taken good care of, I don't see it going anywhere. I received this complimentary hat for inspection and reviewing purposes and if your little one loves to play dress up or if you are looking for a white hat to go with her/his costume, then this hat would be a perfect fit."
"ARRIVED QUICKLY. AS DESCRIBED, GOOD PRICE"
"Great product. Fit as expected for the most part. Neck opening is a bit large, but liveable."
The baby wears it every day. Good things!
"I absolutely love this bra!  I am able to quickly pump at work and in the car.  Things that would make this perfect: clips on the strap so I could also nurse without switching to a nursing bra when I get home from work & no contrast lace - if it was the same color as the bra it would be better.

I also have the Arden bra, but this one is 1000% more comfortable.  Plus it fits me better as I am a 38J."
These fit a little bigger than I was expecting but I'm still able to wear.
"Very cute skirt exactly the way it is pictured,  fits very well especially me being kind of a big girl "
Fits good Looks GREAT and doesn't cost alot and I get tons of compliments when I wear these shoes they have held up great so far!
"Love the color, the fit was good, and I wore them all day and they were comfortable. Would like a bit more arch support for a longer day of standing."
"Need to made in shorter sizes, Will be fine after I wash them a few times in hot water and dry on high heat.
That being said I won't buy any other jeans then Carhartts"
"These are great for a tall or large man.  They are dark, almost look black when they're on.  Lenses are not mirrored, but have a classy look."
"These shoes aren't pretty--they look a lot like hiking boots--but they're pleasantly comfortable. That is, however, because in New Balance shoes I have to order a half size larger in order to get the length I need. This, in turn, necessitates the use of thick socks, which sometimes causes my feet to get too hot after a while. I like the shoes, and I'm glad I have them, but I don't think I'd order another pair."
"Adorable and soft! Fits well on an average adult woman, but probably even better for kids. Note that it does have whiskers! Also, the pin that comes with it is a nice touch."
Bought this to replace a microswitch on a key fob.  Much cheaper than buying a new fob and it worked fine.
"Comfortable, convenient. Comfortable insole, not slippery soles. Before use, I recommend 2 times to treat water-repellent spray..I recommend! Wolverine forever!"
The arrived on time and seem great. They are still a bit big on my daughter so they should last a while. It would be nice if it came with more pairs for price but who wouldnt?!
Used for Christmas pictures. So cute!
Great product that made  identifying luggage very easy.
"Bought this and a similar one for my wife, and she really likes them both. Only Timex could sell such a nice watch at such a great price."
I got this for my wife. It fit her well. It is short and sexy.
"Very cool, heavy, good quality. Very satisfied. I use it as both a lapel and tie pin."
My husband loves this suit vest he was hesitant to purchase this item because of all the reviews saying it was small but it actually for perfectly. He wears a size 44 chest in blazer so to be on the safe side he ordered the extra large and he looks great in it . I would recommend being safe and get the larger size. The quality is good for the price and it arrived very fast.
Very delicate and stylish. Can wear every day or on special occasions. Seems like it will endure the test of time.
I love these shoes. But I always order a half size up in DC and that matches my normal size in other shoes.
Nice pants - I enjoyed wearing them
"Very nice jacket, high quality and worth the money."
"Good quality, very comfy and good looking."
"I love this little number! The thong is a little big, but I was able to fix it myself! The top is perfectly super tiny! I wear it work and it's one of my faves!"
"I love classic black berets, and this fits the bill. They keep ears warm, look chic, fold up easily to fit in pockets and purses, and wash well (I use Woolite, hand wash, and dry flat, on a towel). Thinking of getting a few other colors, too."
Great bag!  Exactly what I was looking for and quicker delivery than expected.
LOVEEEE THEM!!!
great good
"Bought for my daughter thats, great quality n fit. Now I want a pair"
"These bras are great. I love them. They are fashionable, comfortable, soft and fit well.  I will order again."
Cute skirt. Great quality material.
Good fit and the sizing is just right. Looks good with a pair of jeans. I wish the manufacturer would design and produce more color options...
 These shoes.  Didn't fall once!  Comfy comfy!
Wife will write this review.  The fabric is soft to the touch.  It is TTS.  It looks very nice on.  It covers all the areas you want covered.  You will not be disappointed if your order it.
"I purchased these boots to wear during a chicken plant tour. They were perfect with keeping all the ""yuck"" out. They are handy during heavy rains too!"
"I love all my Vogs, but these are my first in the original Prepare family (I have the Tinders from the Prepare 2.0), and they are officially my favorites. I ordered the dark blue for a neutral with jeans when I don't want to make a statement (and they were the only ones in my size), but the turquoise arrived, and I couldn't be happier. They are sold out everywhere in a 10, but the Fluevog gods were smiling upon me and had these beauties land on my doorstep. They run pretty true to size for me, but I have narrow feet and my second toe is shorter than my big toe. Odd thing to mention, I know, but in reviews someone mentioned her long second toe rubbing against the shoe because of the unusual design, so she suggested sizing way up to compensate. I love these shoes. I'm never taking them off. I'm going to sleep in them."
Great socks! Thin but warm.
Love these things! They don't tear easily and they look great
Dainty but well-made. Love this ring!
I love this bag. Lots of room and pockets that allows me to carry all that I need to the gym and get ready for work after my workout.
Fit is true to size and the shoe was comfortable right out of the box.  Nice dressy everyday shoe that goes well with slacks or skirts. Great price for a nice shoe with a good amount of comfort.
This is lightweight but warm.  I purchased this for my husband.  He has poor circulation and is cold all the time.  He can wear this and keep the chill off his neck.  It is light enough that it looks ok.  To be clear this is a heavyweight in warmth but light as in not thick bulky or cumbersome.
If you buy these they are Beautiful great price but if you can go up a size. I wear size 10 and I can wear them but had I known I would have gone up half size or whole size. They are comfortable even with small heel. Very pretty
"A little oversized, decent quality."
"big plain hoops, just as advertised"
Very lovely anklet.  Just what I was looking for.
"The jeans are a great fit, nice stretch, roomy legs.  But there is more material between my knees & to the floor than the entire pair of pants. They are bell bottom-ish like.  I have to either go get them hemmed or either keep them folded to keep from dragging on the ground.  Plus I didn't know there were metal buttons on the back pockets. When you have a large booty, they tend to keep getting caught on things like doorways, chairs, car seats. But for the  most part, they fit, and I am happy."
"Beautiful ring, true to size."
I live in the tropics. Material is perfect for my climate and quality good. This is my pants for almost all occasions.
"THIS WAS THE FLEXFIT HAT AS ADVERTISE
FIT GREAT.... I HAVE A BIGGGG HEAD....
WELL MADE"
Four stars because I'm lucky I read other reviews and order a wider size that just barely made it! If I ordered my regular size I would probably have to return them. Excellent shoes. Light and comfy. Style great. But be careful about sizing. One size larger and wider be safe.
Its a great boot but I found a really good comparable item for much much cheaper so it was returned.
Ordered 2 sets of these as we travel often.  One didn't hold the seal (after many attempts).  The others work great!  Like the fact that you don't necessarily have to use a vacuum although the vacuum compresses much better.
"When getting set to travel, depending upon how long one will be away, there are decisions to make. Do I need my 28"" or just my 24"" possibly with a carry-on. For me, the answer for 2 or 3 day trips is the 24"" and maybe not a carry-on. But, let's be frank. Most 24"" suit cases will allow you to pack in approximately the same amount of clothing and what have you. Most have two exterior pockets. Don't think I've seen one without an interior accessory pocket (this one being mesh). And, there is usually included a detachable clear plastic ditty bag/cosmetic holder. This Wenger has all of those features. What, then, sets it apart? To some degree it is the styling, it looks good. But, I am a Wenger/Victorinox fan. Mostly, though, it is the quality craftsmanship, the attention to detail. The stitching is fantastic, no loose threads, and they are almost completely invisible. The top and side handles are quite secure, as well as well padded when you need to lift the bag for some reason. The wheels roll smoothly and turn on a dime. Never an issue with them. All of the zippers function exactly as they should, never a problem with any of them getting hung up or snagged. The exterior material is very durable. Because this one is not black when being thrown around the airport, in a plane or on the luggage carousel it can pick up some dirt/grease which would be visible. But it cleans rather easily. The aluminum handle extends very easily and there are two locking positions, though there is only about 2 inches difference between the two. The larger exterior pocket has two zippers allowing it to be locked. I generally stuff items in here that I want quick access to once I land, such as a windbreaker, my satnav GPS unit, etc. The upper exterior pocket will easily fit a collapsible umbrella. The interior lining is also quite durable. One thing I did notice when I first got this was that when I opened it there was not that odor that many suitcases seem to have and need to be aired out for a week or so. Not sure if that will be the same for all of them, but it was nice not to have the odor. All in all, a high quality product from Wenger Swiss Gear. It is really really good."
"Runs a little small, but nothing unwearable."
Very comfortable. Great price. Perfect fit.
wearing them now so awesome
One socks I wear
The thigh and leg area fit well. The stomach area was a little tight. I am in an exercise class and hope to wear them in the summer!
"Absolutely Gorgeous , sparkles and just a beautiful piece of jewellery"
Always buy a pair when they are around $14.  Cant go back to any other boxer briefs.
"While these tags don't provide ""active"" GPS location info, and they rely on the good will of others, they serve as what might be the next best practical thing.
I got my first one when taking my first trip to Europe. While my bag was never lost, I did do some testing of the tag and was satisfied with the information returned to me.
Yes, there are a lot of opportunistic and even dishonest people in the world, and these tags won't protect you from them or ""dyed-in-the-wool"" thieves, but if you consider that most bags are lost at some form of mass/public transportation facility, e.g. airport, train station, bus depot, or even a taxi, they provide you with a better chance of retrieving lost items than having nothing at all. ""Active"" devices would require a power source, and might conflict with airline requirements regarding signals they might broadcast.
On the last few trips I've taken, no one of any authority was checking/comparing baggage claim stubs to claimed baggage, allowing anyone to walk out with your bag, so no steps were apparently being taken to prevent errors and thievery from occurring. These are not a panacea, and would not prevent that, but are, instead, a relatively inexpensive measure to take to increase chances of recovering something lost of left-behind.
While they don't guarantee recovery of lost/stolen items, I feel using them gives me a better chance at it than not using them.
They're certainly pretty darn durable, too."
"It fits kind of tight, no room to grow. But they are nice, I like them. Well made and comfortable. I wash them in cold water and line dry. I would recommend to others, Just keep in mind they run small."
"Price was higher than other Web site.
Disappointed w.price"
"although I have other Goghs in a size 6, this one definitely runs a little big. wish I'd bought a 5 but still wearable. would have been a 5 star if fit wasn't for that"
"This shirt works really well as a rash guard and is a very pretty, bright color. It fits exactly like you would expect from looking at the model in the picture: It is a reasonable size/tightness through the shoulders and arms and is tight around the hips. If you have slim hips, this shirt is the perfect design. If you are a pear, it will be a little tight around the hips. As a pear, I don't really like the way this fit me, but I kept it anyway. It is completely form fitting over my belly and rear. It's ok, but not flattering. The Aqua Design rash guards fit a pear body type better. I love all the beautiful colors that Kanu Surf offers though!"
good it
This ring is better in person a must buy for your husband to be or so.
Fits as expected. Soft on the inside. There was a Swedish fish inside? Is that normal lol.
"I wear these to work where there's a pretty formal dress code. They fit right in. The pleating on the front makes them look good and is a bit more comfortable than a flat front. Sometimes pants I've ordered online can be a size too big or small in the waist. The sizing is good. Well, the length is a little bit long. To be fair it seems that half the pants I've bought lately are this way. Maybe that ""pants on the ground"" thing is moving away from just being for jeans.

As far as how well they last over time.... Don't know. I've only had them a couple of months. They've held the crease well and don't wrinkle much if at all. I've had good luck with them. Hope you do too.

I bought them from Amazon with Prime shipping and they came by the promised date."
Seems to be heavy and sturdy.  Will be ordering other dinosaurs.  Cute and unexpected.
"great quality, Carters quality!"
Had to do some adjusting on it but fits fine and is a unique piece.
I Like them. They are comfy. A little big.
"Bought these for my daughter.  Very beautiful, awesome."
Nice product for the price. Not a real waist training corset so don't expect too much for it. Just looks good as a novelty corset
Product packaging smelled but after washing the smell was gone. Loved the way it fit and how the material felt. I ended up ordering 2 of these.
"Love these! So comfy and fits good. The strap on the top is very loose, but I can still walk just fine, it's actually comfortable! Just enough room to put on a pair of socks. That being said I would not wear these hiking do to the strap in front being too big. I will put my Terra Fi Lites on for that. These are comfy for around town, run errands, they are light and fun, just not for uneven ground."
"My husband said that these socks are very cushioned, just hoping the top holds up, the band seems to be not very tight."
"These boots seem very sturdy and undestroyable, and of high quality. True to size. The leather is thick and very nice looking and the details (stamping and lace hooks) are pretty. The soles are very (unusually I would say) thick. I really liked the leather lining - silky and so soft, you won't hurt your bare ankles wearing shorter socks.

I only wore the boots around the house, so I can't comment on how they hold up, though I'm sure they would do a superior job. I returned them because they are VERY heavy. I was going on vacation intending to walk for hours (8+) every day - I thought that these would make my legs tired sooner. I tried on many hiking boots before leaving and weighed all of them. Most were 13 oz, one or two pairs 16 oz, these were 19. Doesn't sound like a big deal, I know. But I could really feel the weight. 6 extra oz per step, thousands step per day - I think it would add up.

I chose Anhu Montara in Red Mahogany and fell in love with them during my vacation, never wanted to take them off! My second choice was Merrell Azura Carex in wine color (yes, I did want boots in as close to red color as possible) but I didn't believe their soles and they were not vibram. These Teva boots were my third choice.
For colder weather or really tough hikes I would choose Keen Gypsum. I was so sorry to let them go! So comfortable. I'm still thinking about getting them back."
"Great, my son loves it!"
"seem to run a little big, but they're very comfortable!  the snap on the inner right ankle rubs.  hoping it will stretch out"
"The jeans fit as I had hoped, but the jean fabric is stretchy and thin... so not to be worn on a fat feeling day as it will show..."
"Love it , I want more"
"This was a gift for my Sister and she loved it.  It wasn't to big for her nor heavy.  If you like turquoise then you""ll love this necklace."
I rec'd this toe ring today and it is beautiful.  Perfect condition!  I have it on and it fits like a glove.  It is gorgeous for the price.
"Very warm and fluffy. Have held up fine after 1 trip through the washer. I wear a size 10 shoe and these fit just fine. Don't really smell the lavender scent, however. I wouldn't buy these socks hoping to smell lavender."
Fantastic shoe and price. I'm very glad I purchased these shoes.
Cant beat Justin boots. Airport friendly as advertised. I wear them all day. All of the other reviews are spot on. Plus for made in the USA!!! Buy American!!!
"Easy to use, great quality and the luggage tags were a nice plus!"
I love these pants...they fit perfectly and look soooo nice.
"This costume is adorable. A bit thin so you may want to put tights underneath to keep your child warm if fall is chilly for you like it how it is for us in the midwest. While I like the costume the product description is misleading. I purchased this costume b/c I liked it and the product DESCRIPTION (not the product features) claims that the boot covers are included. This is not the case. Everything is included EXCEPT boot covers. I'm a bit disappointed because I like the complete ""look"" of a costume."
Nice color and nice fit. Nothing more to say.
Material is very thick.. fits AMAZING..
"Bought It to make a present but it was so nice, they got a gift certificate and I kept it myself. Nothing else needs to be said"
"Amazing! Works like magic. Applied to a very stubborn deep pimple and this stuff dried it up to a significantly smaller, much more shallow pimple overnight. Shocking results . Usually deeper pimples take almost a week to surface. This one never did. Applied a second time and the drying lotion killed off the bacteria completely and obliterated the last bit of debris under the skin. Pimple Never came to the surface and is now completely gone"
"Fits perfectly, helps keep me dry & comfortable at the gym. Does not cling to your body which i like. Made of strong material. Holds up to hand washing & wringing."
My wife likes it alot
Amazing!!! They're so cute and they keep my feet warm and dry. I bought a half size bigger so I could wear heavier socks but I almost think I didn't need to!
"Soft, warm. Shrank a bit in the wash but its still a medium. I'm 5'9"", 175 and the medium is snug but not skintight, sleeves are a tad short."
"Great combat shirt. True to size specs (torso portion is supposed to fit snug). Good for uniform, outdoor activities, etc."
This scarf is adorable and jewelry is good quality . I will buy more from this company.
"There wasn't a braking in period, just put them on and went."
"I just received this item, and omg!! It's so pretty and it looks exactly the like  pic add. Will order another one down the line. I put it on right away."
Gorgeous ear ring set admired by all who see it.  Wonderful match for the 2.00 Ct Oval 9X7mm Green Peridot 925 Sterling necklace.  I highly recommend this product and seller for price and quality.
"It's exactly as pictured and has long enough adjustable strap things to work for taller folk (I'm 5'10"") The bow is also super easy to remove if that's not your thing. It does a perfectly fine job of holding up stockings, so no complaints"
Nice boot.  I bought as a gift for my brother.
Very nice quality and excellent price
Super cute - comfy and a good fit.
PenSee Rare Stainless Steel & Red Wood...; decent qulaity;  come as shown in picture
These boots fit my husband. He likes the style and color.
"Very pretty. I not only will wear it over my swimsuit but as a shirt with camisole underneath it as well. It's very sheer...but so pretty!
I did receive this item at a discount for my full and honest review."
These are by far the most comfy shoes I've ever had. Definitely buying several more pairs
"These pants are good enough, but they have fairly shallow cargo pockets. Not much use there. I prefer their other pants."
"Loved this bday gift! UA is all the rage for athletes, so my son was stoked for this. It is medium, so to me a perfect size. Not too big, not too small. Will definitely buy again."
"Love these shoes! I bought the natural color with brown leather and get many compliments! Very comfortable, I usually where a 7 1/2, sometimes an 8 in tennis shoes and in these I wear a 7 perfectly. Theyre adorable with jeans or leggings and quickly became my go to shoes in warmer seasons."
My husband likes the fit and feel.
"These shoes definitely keepers! I just love them! And that's saying a lot --  I  have an injured toe from a childhood accident; the toe has a lot of scar and scar tissue that can be sensitive to pressure. My other foot has been injured on the inside (needs surgery, I've been told), gets sore in most shoes after just 45 min. or so. But in these shoes, these Travelwool Mules, I can go all day in them! They are comfortable, look smart, support my foot,... and they stay on! I can walk across campus, up stairs, go on a Horticulturists' field, even dance in them! Way to go, Easy Spirit!"
Wife wears it.
"bought for daughter birthday, she is pleased with them"
"I got this gift for my mother-in-law, and she loved it! I get her a charm for every holiday and birthday, now! Great idea!"
Very very comfortable ring. Beautiful and warm gold in color.  Ideal for every day wear. Or an additional pair to any other gemstone or gold rings. Great buy!
Love the durability and comfort of gold toe. Very happy with this purchase.
Great Pandora bracelet just like the ones they sell in the store
baught it as a christmas gift....my grandmother fell in love with it.
The best....I bought 4 pair
I love this backpack! The color (i ordered light blue) is great and i love how easy it is to fold back into the carry bag. I ordered the small one but my husband liked it so much he wants the bigger one!
"Great set up earrings, have not had any issues as of the last couple of months and probably would buy another set in the future."
Broke in after a couple wears. Has this vintage look I was not aware of. I sized down and they're still a little big but that's fine.
"Had these a few weeks and they're still black. I've worn them in water and still in great condition. Only problem is one of the earrings on the largest pair doesn't actually snap all the way closed, I've still worn them and haven't lost it yet though."
"I have searched for a copy of a bracelet that my son wore out.  It couldn't be repaired any more.  So when I saw this, I ordered 2.  So glad I did!  This was his favorite Christmas  gift."
decent bandana
"I love it!!!!
Keeps all the fat in the bra and fits snug. Love the wide Elastic."
"Well made, so soft, adorable. Baby Kathryn wears these often."
"These socks have been great! They aren't too thick, so my son's feet don't get too sweaty. They fit extremely well, I need to buy more of them!"
It's just what I was expecting.
"Excellent quality, highly comfortable at an outstanding price."
"great shirt, heavy material. and more masculine than a tank top."
These run long.
A good product for the price
This is my 12th top from Patty Boutik great quality
"Very comfortable, these are wonderful. I love them.  they do run smaller so I recommend 1 size up. I'm usually a size 10 and ordered an 11 which fit great."
I work on an air ramp. rain or shine. -_-  this poncho is great. I can slip it on and put my reflective vest over it easily. I can carry it with me since it folds up nice and small.
"It's so funny that my son likes a band that broke up before he was even born, but I approve of his choice. He wanted the shirt for Christmas and was thrilled to find it under the tree. It fits as expected, is well-made, and I love the price; so much cheaper than many of the band t-shirts you find on-line."
GREAT bow for the price! I will be ordering more colors!!
Very nice t shirts for the money.
Retro style with modern flair. These have been my all-time favorite shoes. I own six pair in different colors. I wish they were still available to purchase.
Fits my 4 year old perfectly.  He loves it.
A little smaller than expected. Can't fit a folder (because of height). But the reason I gave it 4 stars is that after only owning it for a couple months the zipper teeth are unraveling at the end and the plastic around the treasure chest is breaking off and peeling away from the backpack. We only use this to transport to and from daycare 4 times a week and it honestly doesn't get used much other than to drag around spare clothes in case it's needed at daycare (not actually opened often). So I am not sure how long it would last if you used it a lot.
"This bra fits well, is estetically pretty and it is comfortable. Just wish they had better colors. The champagne color is more of a light peach. And the beige color is a dark taupe. Please improve your colors!"
I love the side snaps.  It makes changing clothes a lot easier!
"I LOVE Doctor Who and when I saw this pin,I knew that it was an instant buy. I love this pin."
This is my second pair the first are still going but look a little worse for wear.  Great boot...
"These are really cute, i have big calves but having the lace all the way to the top allows them to fit perfectly. I am between a 7.5 and 8 in shoes so i bought the 8 and they fit just right."
I liked the quality and style of the pants but was uncomfortable with the fitment I may try them in another size. They were a little more snug than I anticipated compared to other Levis that I own.
"Reading the other reviews, I ordered this a couple sizes up. I am 5'3"" 117lbs with 32DDD. The LG ended up fitting perfectly. Not too tight, but still snug. Everything is covered and in place. I don't think I've ever owned a sports bra that has actually fit me so well."
perfect for my 3 yr old toddler and she loves it. Not too skimpy so it is age appropriate. I doesn't cover much in the way of sun protection but we use it for indoor lessons. It fit as expected for her but we bought size 4 which she seems to be for most things.
"This is a nice bra and it definitely adds some push up. It stays up well without the straps. The only small problem I had is that the band around is pretty tight. I'll take it off after a couple hours and have marks from where it was sitting. But once I wear it a little more, it'll probably stretch out some so I'm fine with that."
loce the fit and suit--well worth the price--also receive lots of compliments.  It covers well where you want coverage but is still attractive on
"Exactly the same picture , I love it"
"Comfy and pretty at the same time.  This bra is one of the more comfortable ones I have had in a long time.  I am now on my 4 th of this same style.  Colors don't matter to me, so i usually go with the least expensive in my size.  They wash well, but i never put them in the dryer. After a half year of use, there are a few pulls and loose elastic, but for the most part, still usable.  Will keep purchasing as long as they are available."
"This is my second pair of Go Walk 2, a different color and slightly different style.  My older Go Walks are machine washable & comfortable but have the problem of picking up lots of gravel.  The Go Walk 2's are even more comfortable and I'm pleased that they don't pick up gravel nearly as much.  Love the comfort and ease of pulling them on and off."
Love these. They look cute with everything and they are super supportive for being on my feet long periods of time for work!
Fits great! I love it and get lots of compliments on it! It's very warm and thick so it's great for the cold!
Comfortable. Price was ok. Walmart has it cheaper with the champion brand. Would not buy again due to price. But it did fit and arrive as advertised.
"Wow, if it fit in the chest just a wee bit better.  Super comfortable.  Exactly what I wanted."
I can't ride in winter time without it. Good quality and price.
Got this for myself for Christmas after convincing myself that a white purse wouldn't be THAT bad of an idea..ha!  This purse is easy to clean and GIGANTIC! It fits everything that you could possibly need in it plus some. Its holding up really well considering the ridiculous amount of stuff that I tote around in it daily. I get a lot of compliments on it and haven't seen anyone else with the same one which is always a bonus! Id recommend this purse to anyone!
"Love them.  Perfect size (not too big or gaudy).  Great value, I would have been happy to pay much more for them."
"Got this for my daughter for school (10th grade) and she absolutely loved the style of it. However, she found that it had a smell that she referred to as a burning smell. Dad and I just found a leather smell but we're putting it in the machine on no spin and delicate to see if we can lessen the smell. If it doesn't work I'll use the backpack myself because I find it to be a perfect fine and nicely crafted backpack."
"I bought these scrubs for my husband as he needed a couple of new pairs. He loved the color of this scrubs which are a dark olive green.
They are really soft and comfortable to wear and the size is perfect, I got him large and they are a great fit on him
They wash and dry really well-they can be worn straight from the dryer and do not need ironing.
These scrubs would be great for all Health Care Professionals, gender neutral too, the great pricing includes top and bottom.
You won't look like a fashionista in these scrubs they are plain, comfortable and workable!!
Dickies have been around for years and have stood the test of time, I personally have some Dickie scrubs which I have had for 11 years and still going strong"
Love the boot but  does not have a zipper as the information said. We ordered the boot because we wanted the zipper
"Great product.  I have one of my own and bought one for my daughter. Works as a belt, but is truly invisible - doesn't bulge or show through shirts (even fitted tanks, camisoles etc) since there is no ""belt buckle"".  Works just like it is supposed to!  Have read other comments about the plastic clasp breaking.  But mine is 3 years old and still in great condition. (We are both slim, women's size 0 and 2 - We don't use the belt to try to cinch a tummy in, just to keep skinny jeans from creeping down). If trying to thin your waistline using a belt, I'd definitely try a different type of belt.."
"Fit is great and I love that there are so many in this pack. Babies seem to dirty up a white t-shirt faster than any other color, so it's great for changes throughout the day."
Great!! Loved it!!
This bead is really beautiful and goes perfectly with my DaVinci Easter egg charm!
"Perfect! I'm a C cup and I ordered a small, it sits RIGHT below my breasts but doesn't ride up so theres no bra slips (thank goodness). The only thing I would change is the length of the top but I would definitely recommend this product."
This is a beautiful watch.  I love it.  I removed five links with a re-sizing tool I previously purchased and it fits perfectly.  I like the way it feels on my wrist.  Some of my watches sit awkwardly and rub my arm.  This one does not.  I also like that the face is larger than some women's watches yet it remains feminine.  If you are looking for something dainty this is not the watch.  It is very durable.  I also purchased the watch with the pink face to give as a gift to my sister but now I think I'm going to keep it!
"I love these boots. Soft, classy and comfortable. I wore it well with a skinny pants and tights. I'll definitely recommend it if you like to have something different."
"Awesome socks! High quality fabric, and very vivid colors. And it's nice showing some national pride every now and then!"
For my daughter she love them .
"I bought this sandal hoping to get a pair that will finally fit my wide feet perfectly (I wear size 11 Nike sandals and my feet is size 10). So, does it fit the bill? Well, in some ways it does. They fit nicely although the front is a bit snug and I still have to let the front straps about 1/4 loose like my Nike sandals. The instep is smooth and feels good to the feet unlike the rubbery Nike instep and other outdoors sandals instep in general (which will gradually feel better only after several wear), and the leather material looks nice too. It claims to be waterproof though I haven't tested them yet and the instep construction while creative (they're not glued to the sole, they're connected by velcro attachment) make squeaking sounds as you hit the ground. This will probably dissipate as I use them more and more daily, but we'll see. All in all, a great pair of sandals and would have been the greatest if they don't make that squeaky sounds. Highly recommended for people with wide feet."
I had these shoes in silver and love them!  This is the same shoe in gold at nearly half the price.  I would buy them in red if I could find them.
"I am a skinny, small framed, small breasted female. i got the small hoping it was small enough and it was!! And it squishes everything  I need it to to the place I need it most and looks great!!"
Good quality. . Boyfriend  loves it
I love this blouse!!
nice hat for the price!
"These are smooth and fit me perfectly. I am 5 ft 135 lbs and they don't roll down my short torso. They're not very conforming but they do smooth out some areas. All in all, I do wear them often"
"You get what you see, fun for a few giggles."
Very good quality.  Well made. Not slippery!  My 4 yo loves them. Definitely will buy it again.
"Fits as expected and high quality
Even ended up wearing them in a photo shoot"
Bought a black pair that I loved so much that I went back and bought the nude color. Really cute and comfortable.
"I have one of these tops in several colors, and this is the prettiest of all.  The color is true to the picture, and very comfortable.  It hardly wrinkles, and is very light weight."
"Great looking and very well made -- all at a very affordable price.

Buy 2 -- I DID!!!"
Great product I ordered it in black
To the batmobile! Fun boxers
I purchased these shoes for my Grandma. She loves them! She finds them to be very cute and comfortable.
"Nice quality, drawstrings worked on my skinny grandson!"
Have three.
This belt worked well for a Camp Crystal Lake costume we put together this Halloween.
"Looks very stylish. The heels are just right. I rated 4 stars only because the material is not that comfy it is very stiff, i cant use this if i have to walk a lot.
It is true to size but i ordered half size up coz i want to have more room when it comes to boots.& so i can use really thick socks. I also like that it fits well in my ankle not like the other boots with big opening. And also u can adjust this by lowering the zipper if u don't want tight fit in the ankle"
"Silver part of earring has an almost diamond cut brilliance to it - more sheen than evidenced in photo, yet very classic in appearance - not as ""busy"" as photo because earring is mostly one colour. Wearable with more than I expected."
Love the way they look.  And the fit seems great.  Have not had a chance to wear them for any length of time yet.
"These shoes are cool. They are comfortable, but not really for walking 18 holes. They don't have enough support. If you are in a cart most of the time grab these. If you are buying  a second or back up pair, grab these. Just don't make them your primary walking golf show."
"Great slippers! Super warm and lots of cushion on the bottom. I usually wear a size 7.5 or 8, but I ordered these in M (6.5-7.5). I find that slippers always stretch considerably after a couple wears, so I always size down and I'm glad I did."
"I love this little bead.  I got it for my own Pandora bracelet since my husband is British.  It was slightly larger than I expected, but the colors are vibrant & it seems fine enough quality for my purposes.  I've had it a couple months now and wear it quite a bit.  It has not lost it's colour or turned in any way.  I've very pleased and would recommend it."
"My daughter loves these flip flops, however they run a little small"
"Bought it as a gift for my daugher who has an obsession with purses, handbags and totes.  She's really picky and she was thrilled with this bag."
"I just started taking water aerobic classes.  I wasn't sure if I was going to like wearing shoes in the water, but they are very comfortable.  I bought them to prevent athelete's feet, and plantar warts that you can get from walking barefoot.  I would strongly recommend buying these.  Free shipping was a plus."
I can thank this shoe for helping me get rid of my heel spur. I have them in bronze and a black pair. So sorry they quit making them. Have had so many people want to know where I bought them.
"Very nice--comfortable--washed up well.  Could be longer in the leg length for me, but okay."
"It is small, but if you get it early enough, then you can train your body over a month or so. Plus that gives the fabric time to relax. The steel boning is perfect though. It doesn't lose its shape after use true way the plastic ones do."
"Same sock on amazon for half the price
In a 6 pack
Bought it 7 months ago
I thought these were a premium
No just same sock in a single at 2xs $$$
There a great sock
Good fit
Long lasting"
"Bought these for my better half, since every store we went to didn't have her size or the color she wanted."
Great bra for me I have 5 of them in different colors. Finding a bra that fits properly isn't easy without trying them on I have found. I'm so happy I can order this style and know it will fit me well.
The width was as expected but the length was a little short.  The color and the feel was nice.
Very pretty but too big. Sent back and ordered another one in smaller size.
"I broke my foot and needed a single shoe that would work with my medical boot, look professional for the office and provide support.  These shoes were great.  Now that I am slowly going back to regular shoes, I find that these give me enough support so that I can wear them about 7 hours.  After my full transition I figure they will work all day.  If you have a high instep, they may be a bit snug at first, but otherwise I like them better than Dansko and they are less expensive.  I wish they came in more colors.
11/6/16 -UPDATE.  Broken foot heeled, shoes still going strong.  I love so much I am about to reorder.  Can't beat the price for a closed clog with this quality and comfort.  I have a narrow heel and a normal width foot.  If you have wide feet, these may be snug on you.  They are definitely not a bulky/clunky as Dankso and people have noticed."
"When I got this shirt it was nicely packaged, the fit was just right but the printed images are not as good as I thought they would be. They're a bit fuzzy. But the material being so soft and good on the skin is worthy of a four star rating."
"I paid too much, but the look on our granddaughter's face was worth it. It is actually much better quality, and prettier than I was expecting. Very happy !"
Love these.  They are very attractive and priced well on Amazon.  I am planning on ordering other colors.
"adorable! perfect kids halloween costume. fit my 6 year old perfectly and lasted through multiple halloween parties, trick or treating and costume day at school"
I LOVE THEM!!!  They are flirty and just awesome.  Just Like the  picture
These worked great for packing and organizing everything from a carry on suitcase to a larger size.  They need to be aired out when you first get them too.
Could have been a little wider to fit a bigger man and the fabric isn't as soft as hoped but overall it was nice. Husband liked it a lot.
"The bottom wrinkles relatively easily, but it is lovely on and washes fairly well. My tall three-year-old fits into a size 5 perfectly!"
"amazing backpack, great for carry on"
I like boardshorts without a velcro fly. Velcro is really scratchy when i don't have underwear on. This is also white so don't look if you don't wanna see.
"Love this top, feels great and fits great."
"I wear a size 32 and medium when it comes to shorts and this fit me without a problem. The material is slightly stretchy and feels good in and out of the water. The shorts have a velcro fly made up of small velcro circles, which is awesome, because a full velcro strip can give an awkward ""bulge"". The colors are vivid and bright, and the side zipper pocket is also a bonus. Great shorts overall."
"This seems to be a well-made bag.  I showed it to a co-worker who is an ex-military and fire department  medic, and she was very impressed and planned to buy one for herself."
Husband loves these pants.  Great for extra cold days when he's outside.
Straps were a little tight on the right shoe only
"I bought this ring to wear during trips so I could leave my wedding set in a secure place.  I had previously been using a titanium band, but it became scratched and dull after 2 trips.  After reading up on tungsten, I decided to buy this ring.  I *love* this ring.  The weight reminds me of platinum.  It is a domed ring,approximately 1mm thick, but I don't mind that. I find it to be very comfortable to wear.  I normally wear 3 bands on my ring finger and the 6mm width is perfect for me, as I've developed a permanent indent from my wedding set.  If your finger widens below the knuckle, this may rub a bit against your other fingers--but with Amazon's free returns policy on it give it a try.  I knew going in that the color would be gunmetal gray, which I find lovely--if you're looking for a silver-toned ring (i.e. silver/platinum/white gold appearance), this isn't for you. The shine on the ring is incredible and I'll be interested to see if it truly holds up.  After seeing it, my husband said ""maybe I should get one too!""--and he isn't a jewelry person at all--so that's a ringing endorsement from him."
First of all...when you open this...be prepared to air it out. I inhaled it by accident and wish I hadn't. That said. It's perfect for the breast cancer walk. My husband who weighs about 100 lbs more than me wore the same size. The color is a nice bright pink and it was what we expected.
Loved the bracelet and it was delivered when stated!
this is the one I wear all the time.  I like the catch and the anklet has not turned like the previous one did
Love this top and Ive bought a black one also.
I like this ring. Good fit with nice roudIt has good color to the stone and nice rounded edges. Nice shine to the metal at first. Over a few days there is a lot of scratches in the metal.
"Nice & WIDE!!!  I have a very hard time finding shoes that fit.  I had to order several styles, had no problem with returning other shoes at no cost!  Buying shoes on line is a hit & miss.  This was worked for me."
"Amazing wedding band!! Bought it for my husband and received it today, but  so far, I am very please with it. My husband is a little rough on jewelry (this will be the third wedding band in two years, we have tried 14k gold and titanium), and I am hoping that all reviews saying that tungsten is scratch-proof turn out to be true. This band has a nice weight to it, it's shiny, beautiful and fits good. Would definitely recommend and buy again! Can't beat the price, and the amazing quality! I love it and will be purchasing other items from King Will!

*Update: Turns out the band I originally bought for my husband was a little loose on him, even though it was his size (10.5). I bought him another one in a size 10, and it fits just fine. I love it! Not a single scratch on either one. Best money I've ever spent! Would buy over and over again!"
Boonie caps are great for yard work or a day at the range.  Keep the sun off your ears and outta your eyes.
"I am a guy and I love these panties! Cute, comfy! Will buy more!"
My kid loves them..
I like this nightgown very much.  Occasionally I use it for a slip under dark dresses that are see through.
"This garment fits perfectly, is very light weight yet warm, and is really soft so it  feels like I am not wearing it."
"Beautiful, wonderful"
I love love this shirt!
"My daughter loves these. The graphics are not exactly as pictured. But, they are Hello Kitty and most of them do have some sparkle to them which is what counted."
I like the underwear very comfort and good price
"Bought this for my 17 year old daughter for Christmas.  She loves it and it's very cute on.  It does tend to run about a size and a half too small.  There was a small space of about 2"" where the embroidery wasn't stitched, but we were able to trim it up so you couldn't tell.  I would definitely recommend it for the price I paid."
"Yet again, another shirt I love by PB.  At first I was confused about the separate neck piece, but then I remembered the item description.  You can wear it with or without, and once again the quality and the feel of the product is great."
Well put together and roomy. I scuffed the toe just a little and it rubbed right out.
"I've lost track of exactly how many of these Green Silence shoes we've bought for my husband over the past several years (beginning, of course, with the bright red/yellow ones that looked like Ronald McDonald shoes).  These shoes have quickly become his favorites; and we now generally order 2-3 pairs at a time.  He finds the shoes to be one step above a minimalist running shoe...comfortable, breathable, and extremely lightweight, and yet well-cushioned.  He wears them for both training and races (marathons, halfs, and 10Ks).  The lifespan of the shoe is pretty good also; he usually gets 300-400 miles out of each pair."
"Know why you want to order this hat?  Because you will not find any linen, ""ivy"" style cap as nice, or as accurately sized-fitted as this, from any online vendor operating in the US.

First, linen is far more difficult and costly to make than cotton-based fabrics.  The fiber it's made from is flax, and one of the few remaining regions in the world that still has a flax farming/manufacturing base large enough to manufacture large quantities of quality linen is ... guess where ... Poland and its surrounding areas/countries.

Second, I literally spent DAYS looking at the offerings of vendors all over the US trying to find a hat like this.  I ordered several, and had to return them all, mainly due to sizing issues.  I've got a big head, and I can never seem to find any caps that I like that quite fit me.  Even this vendor's largest size (XXL -- 62 cm) is right at the limit of the minimum for my head, which measures 61.5 cm.  One of the hats that I returned was SUPPOSEDLY an ""XXL,"" fitting up to 62 cm, but when I received it and measured the circumference of the band, it was actually just a little over 60 cm.  That cap wasn't constructed anywhere as nicely as this one, either.

I paid extra for expedited shipping on this one, and received it within one week of my order.  As I opened the box, I was just praying that it would fit, because this was my last chance to get the kind of cap I wanted to wear to an outdoor wedding ceremony in the coming week, and my time to find one was up.  When I pulled it out of the box and put it on my head, I practically wanted to cry ... it fit me PERFECTLY.  The quality/consistency of the linen is great, and craftsmanship/construction of the cap is very nice throughout.

In sum, I can't recommend this vendor/product highly enough.  Carefully measure your head; follow their instructions on sizing (e.g., if your head measurement falls between two sizes, order the slightly larger one), and you will be very happy."
"I bought 1 size too big but that was my error! Great shoes! Good quality, and very comfy. I would buy again!"
This bra is superb! I wish they had more colors (one color--no piping or distracting trim). This way I could wear it all day for work or the weekends.
Ha!  Bought these for my Lab.  She loves to play tug-of-war.  They were perfect.
"My wife a little concerned ordering shoes online, but very happy with these shoes. A great value in price and she enjoys the comfort and quality."
"Beautiful!  Love the vibrant colors and whimsical design! Since these are intended as stocking stuffers, I can't comment on how well they will wear or laundry, but they are gorgeous.  This was my first Lauren Burch purchase, but you may be sure I'll be back for more!  An easy five stars!"
Fit perfectly (usually wear a size 6) and they feel great and are warm.  I would definitely purchase again.
"The back size is a bit loose so I have to immediately use the second row of hooks, however the cup size is perfect.  Its to cute to return and is as photographed."
This belt is perhaps the most comfortable and best made belt I have ever owned. The material and workmanship are all excellent. the ratchet system used to tighten and loosen the belt work perfectly and is much more comfortable and adjustable than the conventional system used on other belts. I am very pleased with this purchase.
A really nice necklace.  I purchased the matching earrings several weeks ago. Like them so much I decided to order the necklace. Enjoy wearing them.
very nice feature of quick release -supple strap - nice range of colors - easy to install - recommended product
"I got the XL because Im pregnant with hopes that it stretches and it is actually perfect. It fits tight around my belly. But when i lose some of this baby weight it should fit somewhat loose. The fabric is light which could be considered ""cheap"" but the top was very low cost so it is worth what you pay. I will probably get some more in different colors."
"These are the PERFECT shoe for a young toddler!  My daughter is 2 and can easily get them on and off herself.  Additionally, because of the added lip at the front, she can wear them with her Sunday dresses but I don't have to worry about the scuffs.  I only wish they came in several more colors.  These are well worth the money."
my neice & i love them. I bought them as a gift for her but unfortunately not a good fit for her or me as well.
"Nice, my girlfriend loved it !"
"I actually got these as motorcycle boots. I love docs, have owned several pairs over the years. I needed something sturdy for the bike, but something a little fashionable, These were perfect. Pull them up in the cold, wear them down in the heat. Fits great, looks cute and still tough, been lasting through the abuse of an everyday rider, as well as work. The only thing I wish is that they were steel toed! And I love the ribbon-laces. Just be careful if you do ride. I burnt through the right one."
These boots run large and will need to be returned and exchanged.  It would be nice to advise the buyer that item should be ordered in a size smaller than normal.
"I ordered these bandannas to use as table napkins and general light kitchen cloths. I didn't want ""fancy"" table napkins, I wanted something I could use to strain yogurt, wrap vegetables in the fridge, knot around my lunch (instead of using bags), or set out on the table at casual mealtime. The edges on these are hemmed, rather than just serged (which my last set of plain bandanna squares were). The cotton is lightweight and has an almost linen-like texture. I washed them immediately in hot water prior to use, and dried them on the clothesline. They seem to be cut on-grain and have remained square and straight. They do need to be ironed to look decent after washing.

I'm happy with them and will order again."
"It's a bit early to rate a sweatshirt. I usually start loving them after a year or two, but this one is comfortable and of good quality"
"While I still like this hat and it certainly will be fine for my purpose - it's not quite as pictured.

The point of mine is droopy not pointy and upright as pictured. That isn't too bad and sort of adds a twisted wicked witch thing but the real disappointment is the brim.

There is a head covering that is fitted into the hat and the brim - and that is cool, keeps the hat snugged down and looks sophisticated... but the brim, although bent like shown, doesn't line up so that it has that nice graceful curve over the front. Instead it's about half way off. It will work but it isn't quite as cool as the picture."
Very well made wallet. Excellent for todays crdit card users.
"Got them for my wife. She loves them. Only 4 stars as there is a snap clip to clip them together (great idea) BUT the clip is so small and difficult to unsnap it's effectively unusable.

Otherwise as advertised, delivery timely, packaged well. Am satisfied"
Thank you for your quick service. I have been looking for a pair of black oxfords and these are fantastic. They look great with dress slacks and dresses. They are really a very well made shoe. As far as size I am a 8 1/2 and they fit perfectly.
"My husband always have a problem with sneakers, this is the first skecher I bought that fits him perfect. no complaint. will buy another pair."
"My granddaughter is really forward to wearing these on her vacation . She is so excited for both. Pink, of course, is her favourite colour. Thank you for your prompt handling."
"I've had these shoes in black for a few years & love the fit, so wanted another pair in a new color. They are great shoes, you will not regret buying them!"
The ring is nicely made good weight to it feels good on my finger will definitely order more
"I bought this and the slightly thicker band version for post-breast implant removal surgery. They're both great! They're comfortable enough to wear 24/7 and I definitely feel strapped in! I'm going to use them as sports bras, later on."
excellent quality great pants
Can't wait till it gets cooler so my son can wear it.  Looks great on and perfect for our mild southern winters.
Playtex makes really great bras for us women who want to be comfortable ALL DAY LONG.  This bra does that.
Love these.  Dressier than the classic tims!
I love it!! The chain is strong and it's a perfect length!
"LOVE this shoe, so comfortable!"
"I was looking for something to hold my Samsung SII, money, credit cards, photos, etc. so that I can just grab it and go. This certainly fits that bill but, the cross-over strap is not quite as long as I'd like (I'm 5'7""), and there's no place for additional small items. I tried putting my lipstick in the back pocket but it fell out and was lost for good. Over all, however, the quality of this wallet is great; I'm just using it with the hand strap. The snap front worries me a little bit as I'm afraid it'll eventually pull off, but so far it's holding up just fine."
"These boots look great and I got them at a great price.  They need to broken in since my bottom of my foot hurt for a few days.  They do run a bit large and they squeak soooo much on office floors.  I looked up how to stop this squeaking and those suggestions have help a bit.  Over all, great boots and very stylish."
Love this ring. True to size and picture. Looks better than the picture. It is now my favorite birthstone ring.
"I have the ""middle age spread"" and a belt just does not work well anymore. I was tired of having to always stop to tug my pants up. The ""loose fit"" jeans are great but I don't want to walk around with my pants hanging low. These are easy to use and comfortable all day long. Never again feel like my jeans are slipping down."
First and foremost this is a juniors size jacket. Juniors comes after children sizes and then there are woman's sizes. So I bought this for my 10 year old daughter that wears true to her size of 10/12 in large children shirts. I bought a small because everyone said it runs small. Well it fits like a size 14 in girls. Which is what a small in juniors is. So the sizing is actually accurate. The tag even says a s 14. She loves it. It is rather thin but we live in California so hopefully it won't be a problem.
Great quality shirt.  Fits perfect.
i love my ring
"got these for a friend who was having a tough time finding shirts that fit... he's 6/5"", 360, 53 chest, 62 waist...  I got 3XLs and they hang on him perfect, nice straight hang that does a lot to hide his weight, slightly snug after wash, he looks maybe 30-40 pounds lighter with it on, also he says it's the first shirt he can remember that has a long enough cut to fit into pants and still look good hanging out

great product and can fit really big people"
"Love my new Pulsar watch!  Arrived rather quickly via UPS and is not only feminine to look at but made for a small/slender, dainty wrist.  The watch is also water resistant which helps.  Keep in mind this product runs rather small for the wrist."
They fit very well I'm 5'7 1/2 and they actually were a little long I can never find pants long enough lol
"Adorable.  I am not a small woman... 5'7"", usually wear a 16. I normally wear an XL top... Sized up on this and got an XXL. I'm glad I did... Not sure I'd be able to wear an XL. It's a bit shorter than I normally like, but otherwise the fit is great. light cotton material too, and slightly stretchy. Overall I am very pleased with my purchase."
Bought these for my sister to make shirts for my little guy and I love them!
"I live on very rough terrain and this pair fit the bill perfectly.
They are comfy with a ton of support."
I've bought these jeans before in different colors. Never had any issue with them. They fit and hold up well.
"This jacket is light weight but keeps your warm. It has a small bag that comes with it for easy packing which I like. The color is as pictured and I'm very happy with my choice. I normally wear a medium in shirts and large in jackets so it is true to size. I'm 5'6 and 145 lbs. It is not too poofy so it doesn't make you look larger, it's perfect!
Love love this jacket"
I received this product at a discount for review.  My grandson loves them
Love the patriotic flip flops.  Have gotten multiple compliments.
"Beauty comes at a price. This is the most beautiful and the frustrating watch ever! I had to rely on my jeweler to adjust the band length, which is very long, then be given a tutorial as to how I could master the clasp well enough to put on by myself. It is very tricky, not for the myopic and incredibly fiddley. So, will not be worn often which is a pity as it looks so good"
Fit as expected. Average quality. Good for the price you pay for.
These shoes are awsome.
Love these so comfortable purchased a pair in yellow
Very good quality garment.  Fits perfectly.
"And, it looks even better on my wife. The V-neck, the insert and the collar work well together. A buttoned pocket helps set it off. The seams are straight and strong and it is well made overall. The size is within the normal range for the labeled size and it isn't too short.

Best of all my wife says it is very comfortable. We live in the South and it isn't too hot. It is machine washable and didn't fade on my shirts that she put it in with. It went through the dryer and didn't shrink or wrinkle. Nice shirt for the price."
My son loves this belt and gets compliments all the time
"Great price and it came quickly I order one to make sure..it was perfect, I'm the type of person that doesn't like padded bra. Very comfortable and cool to wear. It's true to size Try it you will like it!"
Lovely bag set.  Material is nice n soft.
Very nice and will buy again.
"Perfect for traveling, holds everything I need, and is lightweight!"
"I bought this as a gift for a friend's bachelorette party and I am very happy with my purchase. The quality is great. It's just as good as the stuff you pay twice as much for in the stores at the mall. The green color is gorgeous. Everyone at the party complimented the color. As far as the fit, my friend is 5'8"" and the only issue she has is that she said it's a little bit short on her (she usually wears a medium top so I bought the medium chemise)."
"I love a slip on shoe, its so easy to pull off with anything and comfortable for all day wear. This keds slip on I've been looking at for a while and had it in my wishlist with other options but ended up with this one and I am glad I made the right choice, it looks so good on my feet and is comfortable, not at first as it was kind of narrow but seeing as I knew I was wearing it the next day after getting it, I stuffed it with paper and by the next morning it fit me perfectly with no problems. I love the look of it and it offers a little arch support so I wore it for hours without problems. It fits true to size and you won't be disappointed, I'll be back for more that's for sure. Highly recommend, color is just as shown and its comfy and stylish."
"Trendy shoes for the hubby.  My millennial daughter was like, ""Those are Vati's shoes?!""  Her friends are wearing them.  LOL  They are comfortable and a great fit.  My husband loves Adidas."
A very pretty Ring.  looks good on.
This is just what I have been looking for--works well and hangs on the bench at the foot of my bed without needing a hook or screw.  I war a men's size 10 1/2 shoe and this shoehorn is a back saver (back of the shoe--that is).  My wife wears ladies size 7 1/2 and it works well for her also!
Adorable belt!! The price is right but be aware that shipping may take longer than expected. However the shipping speed IS mentioned in the description. It's a bit snug for me (dress size 12) but I'm going to see if I can stretch it out because it's so fun and flirty!
I love this wig. Of course I had to brush it out before I put it on but as soon as I did it was excellent! I am using this for Harley Quinn by the way.
Love the Shoes! They are so comfortable! No need to break them in. I love the look also! I am not disappointed with these shoes at all! Perfect!!
They look good .THANKS
Love the pattern and the quality. Just wish this designer had a better variety of styles and colors.
"It's cute and short. The make is good quality. Like all costumes, it's a bit scratchy."
"You will not be disappointed ordering these. I am 5'3"" and 165 pounds and these were still a perfect mid thigh length. I ordered the size 12 in the rust and I'm already ordering more. They look very expensive on and I love the material. They can be dressed up with a blazer and heels due to the smooth material. Very flattering in hips and thighs but not too tight. So glad I found these. If you are shorter like me, these make you appear more slender."
"Cute, cute, cute !  And extremely comfortable.  Loads of compliments."
Perfect for my granddaughter turkey hunter
Very pretty. I would recommend it. Very nicely packaged. There's a handy box if you bought this item as a gift. Also comes with a bag for protection.
very nice and coolmy eyes are feeling wellpolarized is king
"Good lord these are some sexy boots...they have been titled the panty droppers by my friends and they are not wrong! I get all kinds of compliments when I wear these. Wouldn't proclaim them as the most comfortable boots in the world, but thus is the price of beauty. They fit well and the size ran true for me."
"This shirt was soft and flattering.
I'm 5'6"", 130 lbs., curvy and slender.
Size medium was just a tad bit big on me, but definitely not a deal breaker.
Holes in the sleeves are a little bit off, but nothing noticeable if this shirt isn't skin tight on you."
amazingly warm
Tall and thin husband. It fit him great without it being to wide. Excellent quality. He wore it for Halloween with his jayne hat.
"This ring is so attractive.  It has comfort fit, which makes it feel like silk sliding on your finger.  Its thickness makes a bold presence on your finger.  The only problem is it can be easy to scratch.  As long as you are careful to avoid knocking it around, you should enjoy it."
"Bought these during a deal of the day sale, so the price was excellent. I've only wore these shoes around 5 times, but so far they have been lightweight, comfortable, and good looking. Hopefully they hold up for quite a while and I will rate them 5 stars."
ITEMS RECEIVED ON TIME.  VERY PRETTY.
"I have to review this jacket because it has lasted over a year for us. My son is small for his age so take that into consideration. We bought this in November, 2015 when he was 8 months old and at 22 months, this size still fits (snugly but it fits). It's one of the only 6-12 things he still wears. He wears 18-24 mo in most pants and shirts. This is a fantastic jacket to wear in the car seat as it's not bulky at all and was recommended by the Car Seat Lady blog. It's been appropriate for temps as low as 40s and 50s. I plan to buy him a 2T next and let him grow into that one. Given how inexpensive this is, I was even more pleased it lasted that long. I wouldn't say there's much stretch to it but I feel it runs larger than normal shirt sizing. It's the perfect fall or early spring jacket and a great first layer for much colder temps."
"Lovely robe - maybe a bit large - I am 5'6"" - 110 lbs - ordered the medium and sent it back for a small - still a bit large, but robes should be loose."
"This suit is beautiful!! I took one star because my lace is slightly bunched up in spot causing it to not lay flat. It is a bit short in the torso, but I have an average size torso and still have full enough coverage in the front to maintain modesty. Im a US 8, typically wear a large in swim wear, and the large in this fits well."
"It seems hard to find a really cute wedge sandal in a cream color but this one is great. I like the color, the fit and the height. Perfect with summer outfits."
We ordered this for my 11 year old.  It was a bit large but he loved it and it fit well enough to wear to school.
"I bought this as a Christmas present for my friend, however, it arrived a little later than promised, which was fine with me, because in the end, they were worth the wait! This owl necklace was so pretty! I almost kept it for myself; it was that cute. I loved every single thing about this, and completely forgot how late it arrived. I might go and ahead and buy another to keep for myself!"
Space saving. Good for travel
I got these because I wanted something cute but with foot support.  These are ideal.  Good foot support and nice traction for on floors. Love wearing them around the house and they are fun enough to wear outside if I wanted.  Would buy again.
"This t shirt is a good cotton shirt. It is soft and comfortable. I like the color and that it came in a v neck. The only ""bad"" thing would be that the sizing runs a bit small.  I love everything else about this shirt. Overall, this is a great find but just order one size larger.
I received this at a discounted price in exchange for a fair and honest review."
Love them and got lots of compliments. easiest heals to walk in!
"i bought this one for my 6 year old brother, he is a tall kid so i bought a size 7 and it fits perfectly, the fabric is strong and the colors are  amazing."
Shrank in the dryer quite a bit.
"Fits ok, but make sure that if you were a half size. Ensure that you order a wide ""D or E"" width"
the top is super soft but I didn't realize it had big slits up the sides
So much more comfortable then I thought they would be!  Lining of footbed is soft and the contouring fits my foot great.  The style is awesome.  Quality and workmanship that I expect from Clarks.
"just love this skirt..the way it flows,, feels, fits! Perfect! washes well when hung to dry. can wear it to work, then change top for something mare dressy to go out in. well made, comfy, durable..highly recommend. great price too."
"I was hesitant to try a shoe where I could not adjust the fit with the laces or open it to put it on.  However, this shoe is great!  It is easy to put on and snugs down exactly right after the shoe is on.  I was amazed when I first put it on!  It is snug and comfortable and the heel doesn't slip at all when walking or running."
Color is lovely but fits a bit small.
"My second pair of these. These being tighter than my last, but my old ones might have been stretched out after a couple of years.
Best ever."
"As a large cup, smaller gal, I had one heck of a time finding a nursing/sleep bra with my first child.  I just made do with regular bras and ended up nursing only a short while.  I am not pregnant w/ my 2nd with just a little more time to go.  This bra will serve me very well as a sleep bra now and then as a sleep and nursing bra (even though the cups don't open up, the wrap front will be almost as good) after baby is here.

Size seems to be spot on.  I am a 34 F right now, so the cups are slightly big, but once I have the baby and the milk comes, I'm sure the F/G size will be perfect."
"love it , nice and stylish"
Sparkly and true to size. Bigger thank expected.
So baggy. Love them
I love these suspenders.  I hate wearing belts and these work great.  Velcro to keep them at the right size and soft against the skin.
Nice quality. Very happy with purchase.
FITS GOOD PERFECT
"A great backup for casual use that's always available.  Even if you like mechanical automatic watches, it's handy to have a backup when you're off doing something outdoorsy or if your watch or watches are in the shop.  Digital watches when used infrequently suffer from battery rundown when you need it.  The last thing you want to do is hunt down the appropriate battery--so you buy a new cheapie watch and throw the old one in the drawer.  This one runs by light power--I say ""light"" rather than ""solar"" because plain office light a couple of  hours a day is enough to keep this thing going.  Even then the dial goes blank and it goes to sleep, when exposed to light, it perks right up again.  If you keep it on desk or shelf as opposed to inside a dark drawer it should always keep the right time.  You may never need to buy a digital watch again."
Nice dress. Had to return and reorder a bigger size. Order a size larger
"I have the hardest time finding well fitting bras.  Because of this, I like to try them on first so I usually go to regular stores to do this. I decided ""what the hell, I'll order some bras on Amazon."" I tried this one and it fits pretty well!! It is well-made and everything feels well supported. Beware though, I think the band size runs small,  but it happens to work for me. I am somewhere between a 32 and a 34 and I am wearing this on the largest notch."
Excellent quality belt. I will be ordering other colors. Thanks
"Soft, comfortable, fits well.  I wear them instead of shorts to cover the odd look of having to wear a support sock (knee to toe) on one leg and to keep skin from sticking to wood chairs or leather car seats in high heat and humidity, yet I remain comfortable.  Am thinking of checking on other colors for late spring and early fall wear."
"I was unsure how these were going to fit since I am 5-11. Pleasantly surprised they are perfect, and almost seem to run big. They feel so nice, and the wear beautifully."
"I don't know about everyone else, but I don't actually want to look as curvy as I do outside the gym while working out (34g). It certainly isn't as supportive as my shock absorber, but it did support well for a circuit training class. You definitely need to clasp the straps for high impact activities."
"So far I love these shoes, am preparing for a marathon, no blisters, no rubs, I did 16 miles yesterday and my feet are fine.  Very pleased, and i love the color combination, a little colorful but not too flashy.  I think I'm sold on brooks, I was always a NB wearer but I think I might be a permanent convert.  I like a wider toe box and these deliver, no pinching on that little toe.  Of note, I usually wore a 7.5 in NB but I bought the 8 in these and they at first felt a little big but they are perfect, no toes hitting the tip of the shoe on those downhills.  Happy trails!"
"It was beautiful. I just had to adjust the straps a little (too long), but it fit well and was very pretty."
Love how these bows look on my daughter! Like that it has a stretchy material.
"If they had another pair in the exact same color and size, I'D BUY THEM! These are the shoes you wish you had bought 2 once you've worn these out! I love them and so does EVERYONE  else. As soon as my size becomes available, I'm doing a repeat buy!"
Shipped super fast I thought it wasn't going to get to me in time for my Marilyn Manson concert but it arrived way earier then expected and it fits like a glove. I had to order a 3X I am a size 14 us and was worried it might be big as I am top small an A cup bit it tightens up really nice and flattering it matches my tutu skirt perfectly I am so excited to wear this corset!!!
"I haven't really had the opportunity to wear them for any length of time. I tried them on when I received them and they are extremely comfortable. The memory foam forms to your foot, giving good support and comfort."
"Great shoes - good support.  Purchased for walking my Great Pyrenees daily for 1.5 miles or more, plus for many other things. They did not dissapoint.  Did go up 1/2 size."
I bought these and a set of 10k gold earrings with silicone backs from someone else. I can tell no difference in the actual earrings at all. But you would think that the backs that are encased in silicone would be more secure. But it's the opposite. This set has tighter fitting backs than the other set.  Both sets they are tiny but the silicone ones slide on and off too easily. Afraid I will lose them. That makes me vote higher for this set. Plus this set has bit more actual gold in the earrings themselves than the 10k.
My 4 year old wore this shirt for Dinosaur day at his preschool and it fit great and I loved the color scheme too.
Wonderful item Well built and solid. Keeps On Ticking! Very nice leather band. Will buy again and refer to friends and colleagues.
"Very cute, was hoping for a little more sparkle, but nice"
"I really like the design but was not looking at the picture close enough.  The large graphic in the picture is actually on the back of the shirt which is fairly common from a design standpoint but as such, the wearer never sees it except when putting it on.  The only graphic on the front is a small representation of the back over to the side (also common design).  It's just a preference, but I would have enjoyed the large graphic which is very cool right in front for all to see instead of only those behind you."
I'm normally a medium so I got it in medium. It fits but loose. It's not that the length and sleeves are off. It's just loose fitting. I typically like a more normal fit or athletic fit but it'll do. It's a nice soft sweater and it makes me feel like a kid again. People seem to like it too and ask me where I got it.
"I don't usually write reviews, but these sandals deserve a 5 star rating. The most comfortable sandals I've ever owned. Looking forward to wearing them a lot this summer."

It is really quality-made and it looks so dainty and perfect. The rose gold is a great compliment to warm skin tones and is great at add warmth to cooler skin tones. I wear a size 7 ring and so that's what I ordered. The fit is perfect. It's not too snug at all it, it hugs my ring finger on my left hand. The little Cubic Zirconia sparkle better than any I've ever seen.

Which is why I made a short video because really anything I say about this ring I want to prove :) I really do love it and I think it adds so much beauty to anything I'm wearing. I personally am preferring the rose gold color to my silver wedding set.

The box it comes in isn't what I would expect from a really high-end looking ring like this. It's just an orange, light material, gift box with a pattern of white triangles and the company name on it. If I were going to give this as a gift, I honestly might choose a fancier looking box because the box doesn't give their jewelry the credit it deserves. I mean it's not a bad box at all and I certainly don't purchase jewelry for the gift box, but it could be more.

Check out the video and watch this ring sparkle. I fell in love when I did!!

I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
"Very comfortable and best support I have ever worn for sneakers! I would definetly recommend these for women looking for comfort,"
Excellent feel and fit
"i order this ring in a size 5 to fit on my pinky, I just love the dangle heart. it is a sweet ring.  .925 Sterling Silver with a Cubic Zirconia in the dangle heart.  perfect for a pinky or for that special teen on her Birthday."
"Shoe materials and workmanship are very satisfied and trustworthy brand. I am an international tourism, Because I don't understand the American shoe size, buy shoes are always inappropriate."
Even though these killed my feet (too big...dont order up stay at your true size!) I still wore them all night because I wasn't about to return them. Im thinking about giving these to my mom and ordering a smaller size for me. I got a couple compliments on them so Im happy.
Wear this shirt all the time. Great buy and an exact fit that I needed!
These are pretty but I wonder if they will be comfortable. They seem a little stiff.
My boy loves these..they are very lightweight for summer.  Not much more to say!
"Consistent precise grind and priced right. The more expensive similar looking product is exactly the same and more money (Ive returned one).  If there is a difference, this brand has 2 ceramic burrs and I believe it to be superior to brand X.
This product was purchased in January of 2017 and today is 11/7/2017. I grind 36 grams of coffee each day (for 3 12 ounce cups) and Im still using the original burr with no signs of  deterioration.
Wish - being that this brand has held up so well, Im ready for an electric motor to spin the grinder at low speeds (no dust formed).  But only if this brand provides the motor and tested at slow grinding speeds."
"I bought these for my bridesmaids, used iron on letters. Very durable super cute and functional"
I HAD TO GO TO MICHAEL'S AND GET A FEW MORE EMBELLISHMENTS TO REALLY MAKE IT LOOK LIKE THE PICTURES ON THE BOX..BUT OVERALL IT WAS A PRETTY GOOD PRODUCT..THANKS!
"granddaughter loves them, wear them to school all day, she said they fit great, I think she got another pair."
They are beautiful! I gave the pair as a gift. I will buy a pair for myself!
"These pants are so comfortable. I was worried the legs would be too tight, I've got pretty big thighs. However, they fit so nice from waist to toe.  (I'm 14/16 and got an XL). The only complaint I would have it they are quite long, nothing a hem can't take care of.  I wore them traveling and they were perfect."
Nice.  Good quality.  Looks like they will hang onto their shape.
Awesome shirt. Colors are bright and fun.
Helpful organization tool for packing and traveling.
Definitely the most comfortable bra I've ever worn!
These are a nice hard foam.
"A few years ago, I migrated from cotton to sheer due to my actively lifestyle - hiking, working-out, yoga, and backpacking.  The sheers breath better than anything, I have found.  These, by far, are the best I have found.  Low-waisted, sheer, firm (top) band, and holds me well.  Initially, I purchased black pair; and, after wearing them one time, I ordered blue and red."
"Even though I returned this item, I really liked it alot. The shorts are not as high waisted as in the picture though. The reason I returned it is because my body was really not in shape to wear this outfit but I definitely think petite females could really rock this outfit."
"Love my chucks... always love chucks, and they always fit a bit larger than what you're used to (I got a men's size 6.5, usually wear a 7 in men's, as I wear an 8.5 or a 9 in women's, and I probably could've gotten a 6, although my feet tend to be wider so that's why I went with the 6,5).. the color is pretty much like the picture on my monitor, and I absolutely love my new shoes!"
Great sandal but I bought no. 8 and it's too small. Just reordered a no. 9.
AWESOME SHIRT!DEEP BEAUTIFUL PURPLE!LOVE THIS COLOR AND SHIRT! EXCELLENT QUALITY!
Cute and have held up. Ive had them for about 6 months. Slightly big in the foot. Good buy for the price.
Very cool Stones shirt. Different and not black. Fit was as expected. I ordered large for my girlfriend to use it as a night shirt or something to wear around the house. It was delivered very quickly too.
The little one loves them.  Thank you.
"I am a 34DD with lots of underarm fat and a short torso. The small was tight at first, but by lunch it was so comfortable that I forgot I was wearing it!"
Very cute! Fits nicely and the hot pink color is great! Very vibrant!
"Fits...I ordered a size  larger, comfortable...looks great...love the color."
Better than expected. Pleasantly surprised.
"Love this dress. I ordered a small and it fits great. My waste is about 28inches. I wear it high up on my waist with a petty coat and it so super cute. The petty coat gives it a big puff, which I love."
My son has sensitive feet and needed these shoes for an extended camping trip.  He was comfortable in these boots right out of the box! Waterproof!  We had him step in a tub of water to test them out before his trip.  He did not get sore feet or calluses wearing them.
Great shorts.  Nice finish.
"Really nice and I am happy with fit.  NOTE: I read other reviews on fit and ordered 1/2 size larger than my size in the sandals to compensate for comments on fit being small. So I wear a size 8 in regular shoes, a size 7 in Vionic sandals and went up to a size 7.5 in this shoe and fits fine. Very good looking shoe, classy and can dress up or down."
"The parcel was well-packed and arrived quickly.  These slippers are very comfortable, and quality made.  I would recommend this product highly."
Exactly what I wanted for work without the hassle of going to malls and not having my size.
Gonna be one of my favorites this summer for sure! Love it!
"Love these, fix great, nice length, great material."
I wish Alexander and David made this in an extra small. Very soft and a great cut for a slightly taller or fuller-figured person.
"Its true, this World's Greatest DAD Shirt, would make a great Father's Day or Birthday Gift, however I got it for my fiance simply because its true. What a nicer way for dad to know you appreciate him, and think his kiddos have the best dad ever! I love that it comes in so many color options, however black was my favorite option, as it is next ti impossible to stain. The shirt itself is very nice. Thick and seemingly well made. It came with a paper saying ""there is nothing wrong with this t-shit"" explaining the printing process and why the ink on the shirt may look ""weird."" I think it looks great though, and even though the ink may be a bit broken in places it gives it character and by no means takes away from the shirt. My fiance usually wears a 2xl but these days I have been noticing them getting a bit snugger on him, so I am glad I bought a 3xl because it fits him just right with a lil wiggle room. Sometimes plus size shirts are wider but not as long, causing belly to show, but these were just the right length. It felt a little scratchy at first, however after a wash it feels much better. Really happy with this shirt and he is also glad to be adding it to his wardrobe. I received this product at a discounted rate"
arrived in great condition. Pandora charms fit well. Clasp seems sturdy.
It has a silky feel to it and is cool.
Love it very  comfortable.
Love them so far. Only time will tell as to how they hold up. They do run small. I originally ordered size 7 (Im size 6.5M) and they were too small. I reordered a size 8 and they fit perfect.
"I really like this purse.  I purchased it to replace the giraffe print one that was stolen from me a few weeks ago.  The down sides on this - the straps are a little too short to go over my shoulder and still be comfortable.  Also, the pockets inside don't keep my meds as neat as I would like.  I think they need to be a bit deeper, or maybe the liner needs to be stiffer?  It does have three zippered pockets that are fine for keeping smaller things separated from the main compartment, but the two pouch-shaped pockets are pretty much useless.  Anything I put in there, meds, business cards, whatever, ends up sliding out, and mixed into the contents in the main portion of the purse.

It is a fairly large purse.  I could put my 4.6 pound dog in there if I didn't already have a wallet, a diabetic kit, and all sorts of other various things I need for my disability.  It has one large zipper on the top that will close the top up and several snaps on the sides to close up even the edges.  It seems to do a good job in keeping the purse closed up, but I wouldn't stress it by overloading the purse.  I am not sure that it would hold if the purse was straining.

The silver hardware seems sturdy and it is nice that each one is bascially a caribinger, so that I can clip things to each side of each strap.  I also like that it matches the zebra print wallet that I also ordered, so it looks like a set.  I also purchased a business card holder that is silver and red.  Overall, I am quite pleased, but there were those few things that bothered me, so I took off a start.  Thay may not matter as much to someone else, but I wanted to be sure that if you are buying it, you know that the straps are kind of short and the pockets not too secure inside.  THe outsite pocket is a zip pocket, so that is plenty secure.

It shipped quickly, and arrived before I expected it.  It was packed well."
"These shoes are really cute.  I have had them for a couple of weeks now and have worn them a couple of times to work.  They do need to be broken in like most heels, but I was able to get through the first day without too much damage done to my feet ;)  They are comfortable and I do expect them to break in nicely.  The suede texture gives a nice look and the shoes compliment my feet really well.  Overall, good purchase.  I am a true size 10 and they are just a bit snug."
"This year the dreaded swim suit season has come upon me much sooner than my body thought, though mentally I am ready.  So when I was offered this product at a discounted rate for fair and unbiased review I was very excited.  The item did take a while to come, but in fairness this was fully disclosed on the shipping forms.  I am use to prime so anything over that 48 hours seems like an eternity.  I got the yellow color and it is very pretty.  A bit more orange then the picture shows but pretty.  The fabric is great too.  I was worried at first that I would sweat right through this but on an 85 degree day it held up and is super cute.  I love the fit and for my size it works well.  I am about 120 pounds and 5/4.  I hope this is helpful for you and I will be purchasing from this seller again.  The prices are very good, I just really wish the shipping was quicker."
I love these slacks.  They are very good quality.  They wear well and last a long time while looking good
"When ordered was not sure if this was what I wanted. Received it promptly and it appeared to be as advertised. Size, length, material and fit were all acceptable. After the first washing the material softened and became one of the most comfortable robes ever."
Excellent comfort!
Great shoe. I have a few pairs. Recommend to go a half size less.
They are a little more hot pink in person which is exactly what I wanted! The fit is very true to size.
excellent for the price and very pretty color
"Quality shoe.
I find I am putting these on all the time. Even around the house.
Packaged well, nice thick box, tissue wrapped,
... leather straps, so comfortable, soft, it really is a beautiful shoe. Well made, solid, good materials and workmanship... feels durable, like it will last a long time.

Very glad I ordered these.
Fit perfectly."
"Very pretty! Light weight. I plan to use it for a bikini cover up, and also as a light weight wrap to cover my shoulders with a summer dress."
My husband finally switched from his tightly whities to these and will never go back. He says they are the most comfortable underwear he has ever worn. They don't ride up and he loves them.  I love that they are cotton. They fit true to size and wash well.
"I like it, it's a lot less 'belly tight' than the pictures appear. I'm, ahem, small breasted, and the cups are a bit large, but that's not uncommon for my size! It's just what I wanted! Oh, and it loosens up in the water...I always forget that!
The many shades of blue and a bit of purple will match many bottoms :-)"
"Not very stylish but they're a bit better than Dad Sunglasses or something. They fit over my glasses just fine, pop into place, and the sides are wide enough that they block the sun as well."
Beautiful!  I brought several Dashikis back from Thailand and saw these on Amazon so purchased a few more colors.  They are the exact same quality and vibrant colors of those I bought in Phuket.  I am SO happy with these!  What a great buy!!
"We all love these shoes!  They can be for dress or casual attire.  I was just glad everyone loved my choice of shoes, since I'm considered al little behind the times.  But I know a bargain when I see it, lol."
easy on and off.  will buy another
Daughter loves it. Soft and warm.
"I am always on the lookout for a new BB foundation creme.

La Roche-Posay Effaclar (seriously that name though) caught my eye. Oil absorbing, matte finish, SPF. I chose the light/medium because the fair light seemed TOO light.

I have fair skin, but pink undertones. The light/medium was too yellow undertone for me, it fits a more light olive toned skin. BUT my girlfriend loves it! Its perfect for her skin, and she loves the way it feels, and looks after hours of wear. I get to see it up close and it really does even out her skin, cover any blemishes and is matte all day."
"These shoes are both stylish and functional. I use them for both lifting and roadwork, and they have held up for going on 5 months. The inside of the sole peeled pretty quickly after I started wearing them, but this is not a major problem.

Edit: I usually untie these shoes when putting them on/off. Today, I made the mistake of trying to don these while they were loosely tied. I crushed the back (this is the first pair of shoes where this has ever happened). After 5 or so minutes of tugging, it popped back into place and now works just the same as before. However, just a warning, don't use these as slip-ons."
I found the waist too big via an inch. but love the product.
"THE BEST. I love these long sleeve bamboo shirts. The 70/30 bamboo/organic cotton blend makes AMAZING SHIRTS. These are the most comfortable and soft shirts and I have 3 with this new black one I ordered off Amazon. The other 2 have been washed numerous times and are still the best shirts. I think the fit is really flattering and they are just so comfortable, so I highly recommend these. The organic cotton along with the bamboo make for really comfortable eco-friendly fabric and regular old t-shirts do not even compare to this shirt."
awesome for travel ... anywhere! Folds into almost nothing but zippers are way stronger than a previous one i ordered!
"I had to return and order the next size down, which fit perfectly."
My grandson wears this to sleep.
The Leveret Women Boot Cut Pants are exactly what I was looking for: nice looking but very comfortable pants for a business casual look. The fabric is crisp and stretchy and I expect they won't loose shape. I got both the black and the grey and I love them. Sizing is accurate for this style. I recommend these pants.
"Vionic shoes have saved my back.  I used to go to the chiropractor three times a month and I haven't gone since I switched to the Vionic brand.  It really does matter what type of shoes you wear and if you have a bad back, get new shoes."
"The BEST! Cozy soft material, beautiful colors, well finished, easy on & off little squirming ones, and look adorable on both boys & girls! I got both purple (eggplant) & coral - very vibrant, fun colors!"
Very Nice Shirt. Everything i expected
"Received it 5 business days early! Monogram is perfect, but a little bigger than expected"
It was a nice fit and looked nice.
kind of tight on my head
"I loved it, a little bit hot for this climate (caribbean island) but, surely durable."
I love the pendant. I was very pleased with the order. Came very fast and the pendant is lovely. Thank hyou
Love these! Will order again!! Super fast shipping !
These socks are great! Fun and functional. Will be buying more soon!
"I wanted to be Little Red Writing Hood (since I am a writer) so I got this outfit for Halloween. It arrived on time, fit well (I am 5""8, 145 lbs & the small fit perfectly), & looked great.  It says small is 6-8, and I also wear Banana Republic 6-8 sizes, as well as American Eagle the same. So it fit standard retailer sizes.

Unfortunately I forgot the hood at home, so I ended up looking like a truck-stop waitress. But heck, that is cute too.

I outfitted myself with a red headband, red heart necklace, white thigh-his with little red bows on them and white 4"" heels & danced the night away..."
"Love this suit.  It's beautiful.  Beware that it is a ""suck me up suit"".  It's tight but once you have it on, it fits great."
Well made and attractive
Great fit. Wished I had ordered second pair. No longer available.
"I love the long shirts of this brand. This is not as long as I use, but it is a good shirt. The quality is great"
Fit well. My son has wide feet. He likes the casual-dressy look. Would buy again. Thank you for your delivery. bye
"My first time trying out Scott-Vincent Borba brand, which is featured on HSN, where you can see clips featuring the makeup artist behind the brand.  The packaging is beautiful, with much care and attention to details, explaining how to use.

I find the brush very soft and designed well for application of the powder.  The compact contains an inner piece you twist to grind just the amount of powder you need for your application.  I found the first time using that I had a bit more of the treatment than the makeup and my initial thoughts after applying was that I had a much lighter tone than my own.  Within a few minutes the powder matched up to my complexion and the look was smooth, bright and I felt like it was very natural.  I only wish there was a shade between the light and medium, as I found the light a little too light for me, especially as summer approaches.  I am a big fan of liquid foundation but would use this product when I feel like changing it up, especially in the warmer weather when a liquid base feels too heavy.

I found the powder did not irritate my skin, which can be slightly sensitive and can get a bit flushed -- no redness after using or breakouts.  Application with the included brush is easy and I can see this brush being excellent for bronzer as well.  The benefit of a dosage of skincare to your foundation with a high SPF (29) is a pleasant combo and I recommend for anyone looking for sun protection in a natural foundation.

Update: I've been playing around with this product and find it gives a beautiful finish over my usual liquid foundation.  It beautifully tones down the shine from liquid base, without being too matte or chalky.  It photographs well and I find I just need a light touch, so this compact should last quite some time used this way."
"I use this every weekday 3 times a day! I'm a teacher so I pump during conference period and off period when I used to get work done! I still get so much work done using this bra! I use it with the undercover mama tanks and slide up my blouse, slide down my nursing tank and bra cups and put this on over my clothes, hook up my Medea pump pieces and bam! The size really does vary and is adjustable. The material is very stretchy and always bounces back even though the cups are stretched several times a day to put on and remove my pump accessories! The cups are double wrapped so you have to hook the pump on the outside flaps and then open up the inside flaps that protect your breasts."
"Runs true to size. Shallow pockets. Very comfortable. The price-to-quality ratio is pretty good.

We'll see how they hold up after a wash!"
Great fit great comfort.  Little hard to get on.
Great love em
I love these I get tons of compliments and they fit great! BUT I forgot about swelling during running and other physical activities. They didn't hurt or anything but I kind of wish I had gotten a half size larger. But all in all they're really great.
My daughter loves these boots. She wears them all the time. She loves that they are pink and shiny. They do scuff easily.
Sleeves are too long but other than that I like it.
"I'm a safe 9.  I can even wear 8 1/2 in most shoes.  So when I say it's too small, it really is.  Because I don't wear it often, I decided to keep it, but I wish now I'd exchanged it for a larger size.  I would love it if it fit correctly.  So, four stars."
"Bought these for my husband.  He's been wearing them for a little over a month now and finds them to be far more comfortable than he expected.  He appreciates that he can slip them on quickly, with or without socks. His work boots are mens size 10-1/2 and these shoes fit well."
Nice T-shirts
"I like this dress. It's a very thin material and is perfect for the hot summer. Fits as described on the size chart. Allot of women  compalin about the size not being accurate but I'm a small, bust:33"" waist:28"" and hips:34 and i'm 111 pounds and the small fit me well.shipping is a bit long but it's still good for the price. My husband loves the dress on me!!!!!!!"
"These ""Dark Used"" jeans are 85% cotton,  13% polyester and 2% elastane.  The jeans come right up to one's hips. The fabric molds to one's body.  There is definitely some stretch to the material, which can make these warm in hot weather, but are comfortable while sitting down and standing. The jeans stretch out over the day and shrink back during the wash cycle.

These jeans fit snugly from waist to knees, then flair out some to the ankles.  No butt crack!  The dye has that ""used"" look in the thighs down to the knees, but is even across the butt and legs. Front pockets are small (3"" deep) but back pockets are deep enough for a normal wallet, 5"".

Made in India.

I am 5'7"" and weigh 135 pounds. Normally size 8 is fine with me.  The 28x30 jeans are a perfect match."
"Maidenform you did it again. I do not know why I even bother shopping at Victoria's Secret Maidenform has a perfect fit for any woman shape or size. Nonetheless, this bra fits perfect you can choose to wear it without the strap but I where I wear with mines with the strap on and again I am NOT disappointed. It also has a gel like for lining inside for no slip so it stays in place. It fits true to its size and affordable."
I love these boots! I got a size 8 but I normally wear a 7.5. I always size up in boots because I have muscular calves so that why that fit as I expected. They look classy and I can't wait to break them in!
"I love these shoes, however, I would not wear them for walking or running distances.  I wear them when I go out shopping.  They are very cute and comfortable enough to wear for every day activities.  I have really high arches and require much more arch support than these provide for long distance walking which for me is up to a couple of miles.  I have other Saucony's for that.

I added a Dr. Scholl's orthodic insert and they are now EXCELLENT.  I wear them everywhere.  So comfortable and after you've worn them for awhile they kind of mold to your feet."
Get compliments every single time I wear it.
"I know this might come off as one of those reviews that the sellers occasionally write to boost their own product ratings, but if you check my review history, I can be scathing when I want to. that being said, the minute I opened the package on this jacket, I loved it. it's sexy and cut well and the medium fits my curves exactly the way it should. the fabric is sort of slinky which is nice because it won't wrinkle easily, but if you buy it, be ready to commit to dry cleaning. I wouldn't toss this in the washing machine."
The Mrs. likes them on me. That's all that counts.
Absolutely beautiful Link Bracelet. My husband loves it and wears it alot and he's not a jewelry person.
"I love the fit of these jeans. They are slightly stonewashed. The price is also very acceptable. It's relatively lighter than regular jeans, which makes it great especially for warmer weathers. I have the blue color. Since finding jeans that fit me perfectly is such a difficult job, I may order them again."
painted it to look real
"Great style, great color. great price. Perfect for our fall weather school days."
My company workers loved it
"So well made, authentic and super cute.  Good price too.  Made in Hawaii."
This necklace is PERFECT. I love it SOO much. My only problem is when it gets tangled because it is very difficult to untangle.
High quality.  Better than I expected.  Will probably last for years.
It's so warm and long enough for a cold winter.
"Branded and a REAL Michael Kors watch. Arrived in the Michael Kors box with manual. The price tag was still attached to mine; $278.00. I am thrilled I bought this watch at $163.00 with free shipping! It's almost too good to be true. My watch had plastic protection on it as well as the watch pillow that the two tone MK watch was securely on. I did have to have my spouse remove 4 links for me to fit like a Boyfriend watch. Substantial weight. A STUNNER for sure! I would absolutely recommend this watch as a gift to a loved one, or a special treat for yourself. I debated between this watch & the Seiko two tone watch priced at $129.00. I'm so glad I decided on this one. The face is perfect and the size is spot on! Definitely unisex. I will keep you updated in 3 months to report back how the watch is holding up. 5 BIG stars for fast delivery, great representation of product, efficiency of the seller, and oh my the price!!! Thank you! I adore it so much. Now looking for a Rose Gold watch by MK. I'm sold on the quality and the overal watch itself. DO NOT HESITATE... Go for it! You will not regret this purchase! Thanks again.
Best,
Shawna L. Diveley"
Fits good. Good price. Zipper is a little testy but normly I don'r zip it anyway.
"Wasnt sure what to expect, but loved it when I opened it."
"These  are wonderful quality & are long enough for those of us who are tall.
And they feel great very comfortable"
Its a great lightweight jacket
I have yet to test these out in the field but so farvthey fit well.
"I was really excited to get this. Its in my favorite color. I tried it on upon arrival. For an XL, its pretty tight. But, Im fine with that as I love my body type. I am 53. Im 180lbs and I have a belly. Im a 38J in a bra. So, I mean, its tight for ME but like I said, Im okay and its still super cute. I will pair with a large scarf and brown, knee high boots to compete the look. Love the long sleeves by the way! And the fabric, honestly is pretty good for the price. Definite American Eagle look with a TJMaxx feel. Im very excited to wear this!"
Love my Puma's
"I have always loved Dr. Marten boots.  When I saw these I was so excited that my size was available and just ordered them immediately.  I wear them with regular weight knee high socks...Not too thick, not too thin...and they were comfortable right out of the box.  The size was correct and true. I wear a US size 6 and in my experience I usually wear Dr. Marten is Women's size 4.  The size of these were right along the same pattern.  I like to wear these with jeans or even dresses depending on the dress.  If you are a Dr. Marten fan...these are worth adding to your collection."
"These are my favorite bras.  I haven't bought any in several years so mine were wearing thin.  I purchased the original ones from Walmart probably over 10 years ago.  I was excited that Amazon carried these particular ones.  I bought 9 of them.  I'll buy more as these wear out, but expect that to be years from now.  They wash and wear well and retain their color. They are soft cotton and very comfortable and provide the support I need.  I bought a size 40.  I wear them with everything."
"I LOVE THIS NECKLACE. It's more of an orangy-gold color than what the picture shows, but it's perfect! The only problem I have with it is that because it's braided, my baby hairs get stuck in it a lot."
Good Novelty Item!!
love this! A+++++
"Very Pleased. Good Fit, maybe a little large but not enough to downsize for me."
absolutely love these pants.  i will buy them again and again.  they fit great!!!
"Beautiful wallet. Good size with a lot of functional pockets/slots. I've always been a fan of Fossil and this wallet just reinforces my feelings :) Very well made, soft leather, good color. I've been using this wallet every day now for over 6 months and it's still in excellent condition."
"These shoes are perfect, They are very comfortable...."
"Loved this item, I would have given it a five star but they are a bit heavy so I can't wear them 24 hours a day.... just for an evening dinner or a few hours."
Naturalizer shoes are well made and very comfortable. They fit my feet in all the right places and are made of leather.
this was a gift for some one happy
"I've been using these shoes the past 3months specifically for squats and deadlifting. They are lightweight and have a solid flat sole that works great for those exercises.
I got the black/gold color, it looks badass to say the least. I usually wear a size 8, which is what I ordered and the length fits fine. Although, even with normal sized feet the shoes do feel pretty tight around the ball of your feet at the knuckles. The sides of my feet would really hurt doing movements like calf raises. What i've been doing lately is keeping the laces loose throughout the bottom and just tightening it at the top (ankle) and tying them.
I strictly use these shoes for my leg days at the gym about twice a week for around 2hrs. They are still very much intact. I wouldn't recommend walking around with them for the day. My feet were aching and for some reason the mesh on the insides are really rough when first using them. They left scabs on the sides of my legs from all the chaffing throughout the day.
All that aside, if you're looking for cheap squat / deadlifting shoes that look and work great then these are definitely an option. Just take a week to break them in and leave the laces loose at the bottom."
My son says 1 of the best gifts he ever got!!! Enuf said! 
"Love these boots I have them in black as well, hope to get them in the red and camel when the become available"
This is the only hat that I would ever order again! LOVE
"I only buy this style of Salomon as it fits my foot and gait perfectly, sizing is consistent.  Wear for every day and for nursing."
Received so many compliments. Very comfortable- I wore them the entire day without any discomfort.. Runs a little small. Go up a half size.
This is the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn. I travel for work and I spend a lot of time in airports. I call these shoes my airport shoes. The leather is soft. The style  is cute. I love Taos and my endless search for the Right shoe is finally over.  Taos is my brand for comfort.
"Comfortable and light. They wear out faster then expected, compare to other Dr. Scholl's product."
"When my husband gave me my charm bracelet it needed some more charms on it, so I ordered these and I am so pleased they fit on it beautifully. Thank you guys... Sheila B."
"I love these shoes. When Keen stopped making my last preferred model several years ago, I had to take a break from them, but these have restored my love for the brand!"
Comfortable and true to size fit.  No complaints!
"I bought this hat because Yupoong mades most Burton snowboard hats I realized. Because I love Burton flexfit hats and that is all I wear because most other hats simply DO NOT fit as well, I thought I would give this hat a try.  It would seem to be the same fit since both flexfit and same maker. And, it does! This hat is great and I will buy more of the same. I bought b/c it was PRIME and I didn't want to wait weeks to receive it. AND, my purpose is to attach a PORSCHE patch to this hat. Thus, why I wanted it blank on front.  I will attach a photo of the finished product with my patch on once complete. But overall, if anyone else wants to tweak a hat by adding a patch, etc. this one is best to do so.  This will allow me to have a hat the no one else in the world has...unique and that is what I wanted. Its worked well and I recommend this over the many others."
"The sleeves are the perfect length and I'm 5'4"", normally crazy long sleeves with Columbia products. The muted purple/grey is a beautiful color. This is not a jacket so much as a heavy cardigan."
I absolutely loved these glasses I get so much compliments on them.
"Cute funny pants, a little thin but they are cheap."
"These are really light weight- a lot lighter than my last pair of Gucci's. The carrying case is also not too big- I'm very happy with my purchase-

JJ"
These boxes really showcase the jewelry that I sell or give as gifts.  I'm very happy with this buy!
I gave these as a gift to an elderly aunt.  She claims they don't bother her.  The adjustable toe strap is definitely a plus.  These look attractive and hold her feet in place for a durable comfortable walk.  I haven't asked if se has walked or stood in them longer than 3 hours.
Absolutely love these. I get so many compliments on them. Bunch up a little at the bottom
Great product. Has a tape measure in the side
My 1st pair of Danskos and they are extremely comfortable! The style of the shoe is very flattering and elongates the leg.
"Perfect fit, I am W25 and got a small."
Fits well. Love the colour. Material is not cheap or see through.
"I needed a replacement bag to carry when I travel.  I love all the pockets, the color, everything about it.  It's light weight, roomy, and has lots of pockets to keep things separate.  I just need to remember which pocket I put stuff in, but that's my fault for being so forgetful, so I can't deduct a star for that.  I really do love this travel bag.  I don't use it for everyday, just for travel.  It's bright so it's easy to find when I get ready to move around.  It is big, and it's roomy.  Love it for traveling."
"Good product, for practice loading and feeling trigger.
Seems overpriced though.
You can get many, many times the number of REAL bullets for about the same price."
"Very, very pretty. Figure-flattering. Soft material. One of my favorites."
good product bad delivery
"Thin soft material which is great because I'm in Florida. I don't know if the fit is true to size yet, but it looks longer than my other 0-3 sleepers. Already ordered more in the other pattern!"
"I imagine this needs to be pretty much perfect for you- since it isn't all that adjustable, but for me this is a great bra.  I don't get those nasty bulges, because it fits very smoothly, and it's quite comfortable.  What isn't all that great is that it is not padded- you can't really use this with t-shirts, unless you don't mind nipple show through."
"I have 2 OGIO backpacks that replaced 2 Everki backpacks this is one of them. There is a ton of storage, quality is good, they are comfortable to carry the straps don't slip (my main complaint with the old ones) the only down side to this one is that is is not TSA friendly, the other OGIO I have is so I switch off. The only other thing I miss on this is the clip for the keys in front but it has a zipper compartment in the strap to cover that. I had even purchased a Tumi Alpha and these are still better for me at least when it comes to functionality, and they cost less."
I LOVE this shirt! I plan on buying in more colors!!!
The wind often has an arctic chill to it which makes walking very unpleasant at times.  Now I can stay warm on my winter walks with the dogs.
Absolutely love this bracelet.  Very classy looking.  Bought a similar necklace to wear with it.  Nice quality.  You will not be disappointed with the fit!  It would be nice if you showed a match with the bracelet.  Women love to buy sets of jewelry!
my son loves this brand and the fact that they are wrinkle free. So I ordered every color.
My daughter loves this dress! Very cute!!
Gorgeous cuff links...literally a piece of art carved into metal
these are great. bit snug but fine after a few minutes.  I wear a 13 b. should be great for the average person
"Love love love!!  Very soft but not at all see through.  Very flattering on.  I'm about a 14 and the X large fit perfectly.  Very stylish.  Perfect length.  I'm 5'3"" and it hits mid thigh.  Perfect with leggings."
These are so comfortable and sturdy.
Great PJ s
A beautiful shoe.
"A belt with excellent quality at a good price, very confotrable, is my second purchase and hope to buy more, I like the quality and comfort"
Dreas is perfect! Love this dress!
They fit really great. So comfortable. Material is soft and jeans tint does not transfer. Best pair of jeans so far.
"Great as an ""underwear"" & long enough (stops just before the knees)."
"When I say that I absolutely love this... I love this.. It is beautiful, soft and really looks good on.. I am 5'5 and it a great length and my husband says babe it looks so good on you... I will definitely purchase again and I highly recommend.  It's very light and airy but no see through."
Good product. Good value. Great service.
I sometimes rolls on the legs but fits well otherwise
Love these leggings! Vibrant colors for Spring and Summer. Feel and fit like pricier Lula Does leggings.
"These are amazing, high quality. Do yourself a favor and buy them! I've used a wide variety of pasties and these easily put all the others to shame. They are SUPER sticky so they stay on but also come off easily. Save the plastic tear off so you can re-use them."
Perfect and stylish.
One of my favorite tops to wear!  Washes great!
My husband loves the shoes.  He is very hard to fit so was glad that these shoes worked out.
My wife loves this shoe on my daughter. It goes with any suit.
"Excellent quality undershirts for my 4 year old. However, it does run small. Size 4 t-shirts fit ""normal"" on my 4 year old and I generally buy him size 5 tshirts that are big but not overwhelmingly big. The size 4/5T here is on the edge of being to small for him. Its ok because they are meant to go UNDER everything else, but any tighter and he'd have trouble pulling them down over his stomach and not having it ride back up. He's a normal slim kid."
This is one of the very few shoes that fit perfectly and does not hurt my feet.  No more searching for shoes!
It's been a long time since I owned a Timex. It's a great watch. The style is clean and looks like it cost a lot more than I paid. I will be adding some more Timex's to my collection.
"Just as expected. Soft, warm, comfortable."
"So wonderful to find a ""leather"" bag made of actual, old-fashioned, non-processed (at least I think it is, or isn't) full-grain leather! Oh, and  to find such a bag NOT MADE IN CHINA! I have recently purchased other ""leather"" totes from another manufacturer/source to find that they smell chemical-like, or just gross. But this smells like the saddles and the good bags of my youth, and I am really pleased. I ordered the red, and I'm bummed because the photo made the red look more like cognac, or a browner red. This is a clear red, no bones about it, a little too happy and bright for me, though I'll give it a day or so to grow on me before making up my mind. Inside the bag, it's lined with a khaki cloth, light enough to be able to see what's inside. It's big enough for my chromebook, and the zipper on top makes it secure.
Update: After checking several Piel bags out, I found that the dark brown leather in this style was the most luxurious looking, and the leather the thickest. It seems Piel uses different types of leather for different bags."
Boot fit as expected and is of good quality.
so comfy and cute. Love it!
Doesn't fit as well as I would like
Pretty dress shoes
"This top is simply made and fits exactly as I expected. After reading the other products reviews I decided to go up a a sizes so that it would fit more loosely and I'm glad I did. It fits perfect. It reminds my of a yoga style top. It is on the thin side so I wear a tank top under it. It fits loosely but doesn't swallow me whole so it is flattering. Also, I ordered it on a Sunday and got it that following Wednesday!  Very quick!"
I have a lot of Life is Good T-shirts but this one does't fit the same as all my others.  I can still wear it but it is more snug than all my others the same size.
Great fit. Loved them
Lots if pockets!
good quality and sooooooo cute
Really pretty & looks just like the picture
"I really like this checkbook cover. I thought it might be hard to get it to close because of the leather, but I didn't have any problems with it at all. The leather is soft and it's easy to use. Holds my checkbook perfectly."
"I love these earrings!  They don't look cheap but don't cost much either!  I am working on getting the black ones too. Sadly, I had ordered they both before, from different companies, and the whit broke and the one of the black tassels were falling out making them useless!  So I received the white ones again and they look better made and I am so hoping they will hold up wll"
I received these as a birthday gift from my wonderful husband and oh my goodness .... how absolutely breathtaking. I can't say enough how lucky I am to have them.
"This is a very nice-looking watch, kind of small compared to what I've been used to, but nice and light on the wrist, and dressy.  I like it."
true to form
"He loved it, but used it all the time and now its time to buy another one. Wish it would last more than a year. He is very careful with things he purchases."
"Very nice over knee socks: not tight as others ( I bought several of other brands). Looks good with black boots, with short boots as well as with over the knee one. For that price, better experience than expectation!"
"These are great sunglasses! I love the fit and the comfort...and I am a small female (with a slightly large noggin.)
They sit perfectly on my nose, the pads are so nice, and the arms are barely noticeable, regarding comfort level. The darkness level
is only a little more than the glasses I now wear, but every little bit helps!!
This is the first time I have bought glasses online, because most glasses I try on seem not to be quite level. These
are perfect!
The extras included are a great bonus! I may need to get another pair, because of my tendency to misplace sunglasses, etc.
Thank you for a wonderful product!!

ETA: 12/14  I actually got to wear these sunglasses in the bright sun, after a dark rainy day yesterday.
The improvement in darkening the sunlight was quite a bit better than I had thought, and the glare was reduced significantly! As I mentioned,
my eyes are very sensitive to light. These are perfect for me!"
"very nice shirt, sizing is way off. shirt was much too tight for a large did not advertise as a slim fit shirt had to send back"
Easier to get on than the last style we got. Wife loves it.
Had to clean it but it works as it says.
"I had purchased the set with 3 different sizes and this set.  I didn't need 3 large cubes, I will be returning this set. They are great for packing jeans and large items. I guess I'm not taking as many as I thought on our upcoming trip!"
"I haven't worn these out yet, but I got them in the green to go with my ugly sweater for a christmas party.  I bought them really as a joke (and beleive me, I still feel a little like a joke wearing them, I'm not usually a leggings girl) but my husband seems to really like them :).  I anticipate they will be quite festive with the rest of my outfit!"
"These are super cute and I love all of the assorted colors. I usually like a cotton blend, but these are very soft and stretchy and very happy with them. As I get older I generally like underwear with a little more coverage and these meet that happy medium. They are cut low enough to still wear with low rise jeans, but have enough coverage to cover my bum. I generally wear a small, but these are so stretchy that the mediums actually worked just fine. The no seam sides are comfortable and nice to have under work clothes and skirts. They are no frill, easy to care for. I just throw them into the laundry with everything and they hold up with no picks."
"Looks great, feels great. Just dropped them off to be washed and pressed at the dry cleaners in preparation for the wedding. They look so sharp!"
"So dry.  SOOOO, SOOO, SOOO dry.

If you have oily skin, absolutely give this a try.  If your skin is combo or dry, PREP YOUR SKIN.  Exfoliate, moisturize, throw on some rose water.  Then let this warm on your skin (or in your hand) before you try blending it.  My skin is combo/dry and this formula was much hard to work with than I anticipated.  (Also, use a setting powder, it, ironicially, helps it look less dry.)

As for coverage, I would describe this as fair to good, but far from exceptional.  I confess that I was expecting more from this brand's reputation.  Amazon has given me the option to try a wide variety of Demablend products, and with the exception of the setting powders and *possibly* the pigment drops, there's really nothing I've tried that I think I would try again. The coverage has (on none of them) met the hype of the brand's reputation.  They've been above average (compared to products from other brands), but they aren't ""amazing"" and I've found almost every product to be drying.

ALL color images for this brand look lighter than the color in person.  I would suggest you seek out additional color images (or visit a cosmetic counter) before deciding on your color selection.

The products did not irritate my sensitive skin beyond the discomfort of the dryness."
Great shoes! My daughter is rough on shoes and these shoes held up nicely!
"I love these sandals as well.  Again, I wore them all day and they were quite comfortable.  I had no problem with the heel height, and I had no sore lower back at the end of the day or the next day.  Only thing is they are a little slick, so when I wore them on a walk at lunch, my foot turned a bit on one of them and didn't sprain anything or that, but I started making a mental note and it seemed that was where the problem (if it really is) was is the underside of the straps.  I may need to adjust the velcro straps to see if that helps.  That may be the issue."
"I took advice from other customers. I'm usually a size 14/16 and ordered a XXL. It fit perfect. Not too tight and not too loose. I am busty and it was just a tad loose on the sides of breasts.  Did not rub to bad under arms. Enough to feel it, but not irritate under the arm. All in all a very well made dress for wearing as a costume. Would recommend it. The fabric does give a bit, and it is very comfortable."
"id give it a 4.5 if i could but im rounding down on this one. The lifetime warranty is excellent, its sturdy and hold a waterbottle great. Its just that.... its not as big as people made it sound so be aware of that. Still well designed and good pockets to keep my laptop and add ons separate from my books and pens ect. It makes up for its disappointing size by being efficient."
It is very beautiful and sexy. It is look like the picture exactly.  I love the pink bar and the shiny tiger . It is brand new.
"Absolutely stunning! My husband loves it and it matches my rose gold ring beautifully!  Quick shipping,  would definitely buy from again!"
I've bought several of these through the years as gifts.  It is a roomy fit.
Great ring! Bought this as a back up beater ring to wear as a wedding band while traveling abroad and I love it. I wish it came in 1/2 sizes as well.
Great fit very comfortable! !
"These are very quality sunglasses. I was skeptical of their authenticity because they are $60 less than what the Ray-Ban site sells them for, but they seem to be the real deal. I have a pair of wayfarers that were bought directly from Ray-Ban and they are pretty much the same in terms of quality lens and frame. These are great glasses for a great price!"
Great looking and feeling shoe!
"A nice city-chukka boot with the usual good Timberland quality. The sole is a bit thinner than I'd like under the front 1/2 of the boot, and I wonder about the long-term wear, but the long lean look makes this stylish enough to mix with casual, nicer jeans and even office casual wear during mixed weather.  Stormproof welting, and oiled leather keeps this one watertight in the rain and snow, it also appears to be able to be easily resoled if it comes to that."
"We had to dress as a ninja turtles to match my 4 year old's Halloween costume. Let's just say it was a hit... all of the accessories are awesome and the XL was a great overall fit for my husband who wears a L/XL Shirt; 36-38'' waist pants, 5'11."
Very thick 100% cotton material.
"It's a very cool design! Kind a ""trippy"" to look at. Not as long as a shoulder strap as I would like, lands at my waist not hip so much where other messenger bags normally fall. Other wise a pretty fun travel/snack/storage bag. Probably to small for most laptops."
We used this as a costume for my one year old on halloween. Perfect!
Great for how cheap they are
Love this sweater.  I have 3 in different colors.  Washes well.
EXPENSIVE SINGLE STRETCHER BUT HUSBAND NEEDED TO WIDEN  THE BACK OF THE SHOE SLIPPERS IT WORKS  BETTERTHAN RETURNING THE SHOES OVERSEAS
"daughter loves them, this is our second pair"
"wife loved the support of this sports bra, but the size runs a little small.  giving it 4 stars due to having to send it back."
"5'5"" 220 lbs fits perfect light for summer"
"I have the bronte lo boot by emu and decided to purchase these. the only problem is that I wear a half size and usually round down to the whole size but with this shoe I had to go up. The grey is great, absolutely love these so much, I went to the mall and purchased the black in the stinger mini. A++++++++++++++++++  As always amazon is awesome!!!!!!"
but  beautiful
"What a nice, shimmery charm.  I love the size and that it is silver. Can't wait to hear from my mother in law, when she gets it.  She's sure to love it too"
"it slides on easy, as soon as you out figure out which is the correct way for the handles in the back of luggage.
I turn my luggage up side down to zip it closed on the bottom. It's not a  heavy thick material! its good enough to stop scratches on your luggage."
"The v neck is not as deep as you'd expect. No cami needed. It was shorter than expected. It hit above my knee by 4 inches. I am 5'8"". It might fit at the knee for shorter gals. Sizing was accurate for me. Nice cotton feel to fabric and breathable."
"Purchased for my son, he loves that they are lightweight but good support for standing on his feet all evening at work."
Love love love this sweater. Nice quality for the price. Fits well. Super cute.
"I normally wear a X large, but the XX Large is more comfortable. They work great hiking or cardio in the gym, very comfortable..."
Love it. Comfy and cozy and I can wear with tights
"I like them i bought it for my nephew and they are good, they are a little bit large but it's ok"
"Since I'm an XS/S in everything I went ahead and ordered the Small size in this bra. It's definitely too small.
I'm currently a 36B while nursing and while it holds everything in it's riding up my back like crazy, it feels like the shoulder lengths were designed for tweens.
Other than that little hiccup this bra is amazing. It's definitely the most comfortable thing I own, even in the too small size. It literally feels like you don't have it on, yet everything feels nice and in place.
I've already ordered more in my correct Medium size.
If I remember, I will update thist to add the package sizing info when the next one arrives so that others can hopefully avoid this issue. Until then, I recommend buying this but sizing up.
**sizing from package**
Small - 32/34 A-C
Medium - 32D, 34 D/DD, 36 B/C, 38B
Large - 36 D/DD, 38 C/D, 40 B/C
XLarge - 38 DD, 40 D/DD, 42 B/C"
"I wear this 24/7. I use to hardly ever take my ring out with me as I ride a motorcycle (nearly) daily, work with my hands all day, etc. Just too much going on with fear of scratching my ring, losing it, or not being able to get it off if something bad happens. Now with this, It's constantly on. If I lose it, oh well... just $20."
I love this it's so fun to play with the colors are different then the picture and I got dirty fast but I still really like it
"I ordered the BLACK color choice, hoping to match these slacks to a nice black blazer I own.
I'd classify them as a very dark matte grey. Compared with my other black clothing, they're a shade or two lighter.
For those looking for true black color dress trousers, try elsewhere.

If that's not an issue, I'd concur with the majority here; these khakis feel soft and elegant, fit nicely and look good."
"Very cute and seems of good quality.  I'm a 32DD, and I usually wear a size 6.  Thought a large would be okay, but it's definitely too small (both top and bottoms).  Just ordered the XL, and feel confident it'll fit just fine.  Now I'm only pouting, because I had to forfeit my prime privileges to do so.."
love love love these boots
WHEN I RECEIVED THESE I DIDN'T THINK THEY WERE ANY GOOD BECAUSE THEY ARE SILVER IN COLOR.  I THOUGHT I WOULD BE ABLE TO SEE THEM THROUGH A WHITE SHIRT BUT I CAN'T.  THEY ARE A GOOD QUALITY AND I WOULD BUY THEM AGAIN.
soft and a little small but are very comfortable
"I received the black ""hand"" today and promptly used it
It's a sturdy attractive holder.  Sure beats leaving jewelry in a dish or on the counter
Arrived well packaged and the box is recyclable.  Much appreciated  Thks"
"Completed my costume well. Fit great, no runs."
Great fit and very comfortable .  I purchased every color!
"Another PattyBoutik hit! This shirt is soft, cute, and versatile. I ordered the Medium and it fits perfectly; I am 5'6"" 144lbs, a 36DD Bust and normally wear a dress size 10

I wear the one I have so much that I've ordered another top (same color). Wish the colors weren't pastels....a beautifully cut top... Love love love it again."
Very nice color fit and size.
"i wasn't expecting to be able to wear these more than once, but i can get sometimes more than 3 uses out of each!! absolutely perfect. stays up, holds well, does what it says, comes in black AND nude together for that price. can't get any better."
bought for my daughter and she loves them.
Love this hat. Fit as expected. Got for my son and he looks super fly lol.
Amazing shoes... need to order another 3 pairs. Most comfortable shoes I have ever known
awesome pants!!
"Fantastic. By far, Salomon athletic shoes are amazing footwear. They need no broken in period. The support they offer is nothing short of outstanding."
Longer T stats  tucked which is what I needed. Prefer a thinner weight but this is not too heavy. Good but for the money.
"I bought this wallet as a gift which I have yet to give. However, I am very pleased with the look and feel of the product and I fully expect that it will be well received as a birthday gift soon."
"Super cute and comfy!
I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for a fair and honest review."
Very good support for active lifestyle.  Wider straps mean no digging into the shoulders.  A good buy.
Fit well and super comfy with insoles. I needed insoles because I have skinny ankles and feet so mine slid around.
My granddaughter LOVED it!!
I really like this shoe but it runs a half size small. Very well made with a wider toe box than most (which I wanted)
They are all cotton so will shrink a little when washed.
"Not sure why Amazon is prompting me to write a shoe review since I purchased sunglasses. Interesting. Anyway, these glasses are just as expected. Classic aviator size and shape. Love the mirrored color lenses. Would love to purchase in another color if I can scrape together unnecessary-but-super-fun-glasses money. :)"
"im 5'5', 120 lbs and 34A and got the M - the top fit perfectly but the bottom is wayy too small. i was gonna try to get away with it but theres just not enough fabric and smushes my average sized butt with the elastic on the side. I may reorder and try for the large because the quality was surprisingly nice."
Very sexy. Fits great feels great!
I ordered the size I would have purchased in a local store and it fits.  Very comfortable with room for when moving around.
"my daughter love it, thanks Amazon this was the best christmas ever"
I love these hats and bought a second. The fit is super cut and it's light enough for my cruise. Score!!
Nice belt.  Casual look.  A little too stretchy so I keep having to tighten it.  Otherwise I would recommend it.
"Love the top, but too tight."
"The shirt is described as large, but it is a tad bit small on my son. The sleeves are too short. My son will wear it around the house and to play in so I will not be returning the item."
"Love this shoe. Ordered three different pair for myself (different colors, and rotation) and now have ordered a pair each for my daughters.  I've run in ASICS for years; but have used Zoots for racing.  This is easier to get on in T2, and is fits so much better!!!
  and this seller is great too!!
 pa"
This is nice and warm and made well.
They  came on time...these also are for a gift. The beads aren't as big as I thought but  I hope my Daughter-in-law likes it.
"Perfect fit.  Good, comfortable sock."
Adorable. My cousin loves starbucks and this is the closest charm I could find that resembles that. Charm is shiny. Its perfect.  Would recommend !
"A toddler wore this whobtypically wears a 4T. They fit perfect around the waste, but they were really short on her. Shes taller so it was kind of expected. They were cute though and worth the 1 time wear."
"I love these shoes,  incredibly comfortable and stylish.  they fit right in at the business meeting or on a quick trip to the store.  they get compliments and have held up well.  100% worth the price you pay.  for leather shoes these won't break the bank but also are not 45$ fake leather knockoffs that smell bad."
"Very nice size, not super huge but holds two beach towels and all the lotions and stuff you need at the beach. It's vinyl lined which is great for wet suits. I loved the color options."
Good cheap polyester hat.
The leggings fit great and I really appreciate the fact that they go around my natural waist. Helps conceal the extra  around my  waist without creating the muffin top. I pair them with some cute summer tunics and have received multiple compliments.
"Super cute tunic, comfortable sleeves, nice neckline, soft material.  I am 5'3"" 125 lbs. and I ordered a Small.  It fits great with room to spare, longer over the booty profile - perfect for leggings."
"It is comfortable after a couple of uses, the first couple of times I found the material to be a bit more itchy than I could tolerate, with a couple of washes became better."
Absolutely adorable! High quality costume and the 6-12 month size fits my 9 month old perfectly.
"I continue to be impressed with the customer jewelry available from Amazon. These earrings of cubic zirconia stones and multi-toned plated metal look like the real deal.

Tasteful little CZ diamonds, set in two tones of gold, spiral in to the center at angles made to catch light. They circle a larger faceted stone that appears to dangle from the middle. If these were big earrings, they'd scream costume. It's their small size that lends to the illusion. If I didn't know, I would easily believe them to be made of solid precious metals set with true diamonds.

Another plus of being diminutive is having daytime and nighttime versatility. Despite having lots of stones in a design with some complexity, being small brings a degree of subtlety. I think anyone that confidently mixes and matches styles could work them with casual as well as business and evening dress.

I'd be happy giving or getting these. Very pretty."
Love these jeans.  Fit great - especially for a curvy body.
"I'm 5'9"" tall with a rather large tummy. This dress/top is slimming and super attractive.  Quality of fabric and manufacturing is perfect."
"Got this as a gift for my brother. He LOVES it!!! I will say that the shirt is a bit stiff though- despite washing it a few times. However, the color is still bright & as patriotic as ever. True to size and well made, I'd buy the shirt again.... just not sure you need more than one of these bad boys in your closet!"
"I was looking for a wallet that would hold cash, change, and a ton of cards (credit cards, insurance, store rewards cards, etc.).  This wallet does hold all my stuff, with extra clear slots for a few wallet photos of my family.  Tons of slots and pockets for organizing everything.  This is a huge wallet so you probably wouldn't like it if you carry a tiny purse!

Unfortunately I just found this wallet too large and awkward.  Putting my checkbook in the wallet made it very fat and bulky.  Even without the checkbook, the wallet has a built-in checkbook flap and a built-in flap with clear slots for photos/IDs.  These two flaps PLUS the outside flap that snaps it all together just made it take too long to find the card I needed -- I don't like fumbling around with my wallet while people behind me wait in line!  I might reconsider this wallet if the checkbook flap and photo flap were removable, but as is, I didn't think this is a very user-friendly wallet.  Also, the pen loop is much wider than your average pen, so your pen will fall out unless you slide it all the way down so the pen clip goes over the loop -- and then the tip of the pen will stick out the bottom of the wallet!

For color reference, I ordered Cobalt which was fairly true to the color I see on my monitor (which is a lighter blue than a true cobalt).  The outside is faux leather and all interior components are fabric."
comfortable!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm actually a very fit person but I'm having a little problem with some small love-handles. With this insta slim they go away instantly. one thing to keep in mind; it fits very very tight so please remember to order a size or two larger than normal. I'm a big guy very muscular and fit; I usually order a extra large but this time after reading others reviews I order XXXL and it fit me perfectly.
I am addicted to boots and this pair is one of my favorites! It arrived in like two or three days. I use it alot lately and it is comfortable pair. Very light boots than I expected.
These are fine
It's a really cute top. I enjoy it. Thank you.
Love these little boots they were exactly what I was looking for.  I get a lot of complements on them. They are comfortable as well.
"Great for the kids, although they are a little thin, holes began to wear through rather quickly."
"Bought this shirt for my husband & he likes it a lot. Many of the other reviews stated that this was running a little bit small, so I ordered him an XL instead of his usual Large & it fits perfectly. Material is really soft & the blue is a pretty color."
"My mom told me that I destroyed my first pair of shoes in no time, and I have wrecked every pair since. These are my second pair of merrel trail glove shoes. The first pair was the trail glove 2, and it was the best shoe I ever owned. While most shoes last no more than 4 months, sometimes 6, these shoes went 10 months before causing problems for me. The feel is closer to barefoot than any other shoe I have worn; I prefer them to vibrams because you can reasonably wear socks and they are more comfortable and I would say slightly more durable.

I have ran in these shoes, worked countless hours on a factory floor in them, and as a sending off after 11 months I wore them in a tough mudder. (If you're gonna wear these in a tough mudder you will be better off barefoot.) If you have feet that can handle hitting the ground under their own support like mine, i highly recommend them.

4 stars because this particular pair had a hard spot that gave me a small blister on my pinky toe before they were broken in, which rarely happens to my caveman feet. I cannot remember the last time a new show gave me a blister."
"Really good quality as expected from Levi's, and fits perfectly. Recieved it way before I was expecting, can't ask for much more, was the smoothest buy I've done."
This a beautiful romper great material this is a must buy.
I bought this watch for my boyfriend for his birthday.  The best thing about this watch is that it is so detailed and very high quality... everyone assumes I paid three times as much for it. I highly recommend it as a gift!
"I like the shoes but they are narrow, I would not consider my feet to be wide but they look wide in these shoes. I like them a lot."
These are the softest pants I've ever had. I love them. I plan on buying more pairs. I got them in light purple and they're pretty.
Very nice pashmina. Gave as a gift and it was very much loved. Very soft and a more unique color than most
One of my favorite rose gold pieces.
Wonderful shoe for 8 hours on your feet. I think they would be good for any type of foot problem.
"Great fitting bra, and very pretty. Gives good support and creates sexy cleavage."
"I recommend to order half size up because the shoes is too narrow. I have a narrow feet but still my original size of 7 (which I ordered) is not fitting comfortably. Other than that, i like the  sryle."
"I have worn POUCH briefs for years (I'm 87). It's the best Jockey I've ever worn. After having too large sizes, I learned how to order a better fitting size.  Thanks"
It's pretty good. The size is fine.
"awesome shorts, bigger than expected.  should have gotten a size smaller."
Lightweight and made well.
"Super comfy, I'm 5'7 & got a small regular length"

- Push button opens the wings.
- Easy to adjust and set.
- Kids love it when you're holding them. (if you're a grandma)
- Neat steam-punk type design. (if you're into cosplay)
- Overall, super unique... I've never seen anything like this.

Note: Doesn't come with a vase.

Note: I was given a sample of this product in exchange for a review and demonstration, which of course has no bearing on the honesty of my opinions regarding the product. Hope my demonstration and test helps!

 Bottom line: would I recommend this product to one of my friends?
 Yes, absolutely."
This is my first pair of Dansko shoes and I absolutely love them. The fit is perfect and they feel amazing.
"Super fresh. Fit great, lightweight...sold me on the actual clubmasters."
"These fit a little bit small, but they are super cozy. They are nice and warm and perfect for winter! They have some kind of weird seams in the butt and crotch region though. They wouldn't look very stylish without another covering garment like a long shirt, a dress, a skirt, or shorts."
"Okay, let's get this out of the way - this backpack is expensive. I admit if this weren't available as a Vine item, I wouldn't pay so much for a backpack because I'm too frugal. But, if you're looking for a designer-label backpack for the masses, you're already prepared to pay a bit more for the item.

The bag is suitable for all genders. I can fit an older 15"" Macbook Pro circa 2009 with a non-SSD hard drive and a Super-Drive in the lightly padded laptop pocket, with the two corners touching the top of the bag without stretching the bag or struggling to stuff it in. I've already decided this bag is what I'll use to transport my old laptop.

The backpack is very classy and understated, which is how I prefer my products. The outer material feels very sturdy and uses thicker nylon fabric. The inside is lined, unlike many cheaper backpacks. The zippers slide smoothly. The zipper pulls are big for easy zippering. The bottom panel has something stiff inside for support, giving this a bit more structured look. The slightly rounded boxy look also uses space more efficiently.

I like that the bag doesn't have a dozen compartments. It doesn't have a special panel for headphone wires, pen holders and other tiny pockets. Besides the laptop pocket, the main compartment has two additional pockets and a zippered compartment, along with the zippered outer compartment. However, I do wish this had a water bottle holder, though I admit adding one would take away from its simple, refined look.

This has a bit of that premium feel than the book bags I'm used to. The black color gives this an elegant look. It's a very nice bag without screaming, ""I'm expensive - steal me."""
"Love them. True to size, fit perfectly over shoes. Great find. Use for around the house, outside areas of yard."
Great watch for nursing school. Cute and colorful! Would highly recommend!
"I haven't used this yet but, the quality seems nice.  I have a four month old and bought a size up per reviews."
"I love these shoes, I usually wear between a 9 1/2 and a 10 in shoes, a 9 1/2 in Toms works for me. These fit great and look great, though they don't have a lot of support if you plan on wearing them all day."
This is very sparkly and my daughter loved it. I would hand wash or delicate cycle though bc the ribbon doesn't hold up for too long washing it normally
I love this wig! It's just as it was described and I wear it a lot!!!!
"Incredibly comfortable, according to hubby. Fit is great, size is right."
"Cute, comfortable. Fits right. Great material, looks just like the pic"
"My daughter loves these shoes, especially because they light up. Perfect for summer fun!"
Love them and the price and super comfortable !
"I love this skirt and it fits perfectly. I love the flow and the material.. I purchase the medium and I am glad I did. I usually wear a 10/12 in dress and my waist is about 36 inches.. I am 5'8 and 185 lbs. The waist of the skirt has elastic so It is stretchy.. Hopefully this will be helpful to someone..,"
Everything about this show is great. I've had my pair for over 2 years.  I wear them everywhere and they only show minimal wear.  I'll always buy any oboz product.  I live in Vermont and we only buy quality outdoor footwear here.
"Just received it.  Seems well made. I was pleased to find that it fits well. It's too cold to wear it right now where I live, but I think it will do fine as a light jacket later this spring.  I was going to buy a NorthStar jacket of similar weight, but I just couldn't pass up the lower price for this Weatherproof one.  I'm giving it four stars only because I haven't had the chance to wear it in suitable weather."
You would be crazy not to wear this product. Great quality and service second to none
The case is beautiful and exactly as I expected.  I like it so much that I have already ordered another.
"Third pair. That should say enough. Great for those needing a solution for low dexterity or remedial/low fine motor skills. Arthritics, kids with developmental disabilities, etc."
"I Had To Shorten The Band,But Other Than That It's Very Nice."
"It's a  little tight width-wise, but I've worn them since late spring and summer, and they're too hot for me to wear for more than a couple hours. Some water proof shoes are like that, but not all. I own other pairs and can wear them year round.

They have a nice grip though and appear well-put together, yet I only wore them a few times. They look good too, which is a subjective take."
This is the second pair of Lexi Marigold I have purchased. I have both the blue and black sandals. The style goes with dress up and casual.  Will definitely purchase the yellow.
These earrings are the perfect accessory to any outfit. They color is great and is very versatile. They aren't too heavy so I don't mind wearing them for long periods of time.
comfy well made -love it
"Your back can be in pain the first few days wearing it. I suggest only for a few hours at a time spread out.

That being said, it works amazing, just as advertised, my only complaint are the sleeves are too long to hid under my short sleeve dress shirts."
"They are fine, expected them to be!!The best part is shopping on line as I have a problem walking.  Thanks Amazon."
"LOVE these!!!!!!!!! Cute and comfy, what more can u ask for "
"It's perfectly good for casual purposes. I have a pair of regular glasses as well as a pair of sunglasses, and I'm able to fit both of them in this case easily. I just use the microbags that came with the glasses as padding between them so the lenses don't get scratched. I don't believe this case is sturdy enough for really rugged use. It's not a solid, hard case, and any really hefty weight placed on it would crush the glasses inside. If you're looking for a piece of indestructible armor for your glasses, this is not it. If you just want something to put one or two pairs of glasses in to keep them from getting scratched and provide casual shock protection, this is a good case."
I'm a girl and I'm 9-11 size and I bought for me and fit me perfect. I love the design and the material is good.
"These booties are well made & comfortable.  The width is perfect which I needed for a toe that likes to misbehave.  They look classy & neutral. The low heel & monk style can be worn with skirts, jeans, & casual dresses."
My favorite roller. Well made and designed all around. Top choice. Great value.
"Very fitted, perfect and true to size.  Was worried about fat rolls...super happy that this is very flattering! Know that there is no way around the off the shoulder so be prepared to show off all your beautiful parts...love it!"
Cute with so many things. Jeans and a white tee look terrific with this little scarf.
"I really like these! I was afraid the thicker sides would make them feel heavy, but they are very comfortable. The lenses are the perfect size for a smaller face. The price was great too! I would definitely recommend these sunglasses."
"The engraving is well done, right to specifications. The chain and clasp are good. Wish chain length would come in more choices. I was surprised at feel of pendant. I thought it would feel more like a coin. It's very light and feels like an aluminum tab of a soda can. Wish it were a little weightier."
"Very light, good beach dress."
Very pretty cloth that fitted well to my daughter. I recommend this cloth.
Work great for my pendant.
"It's OK, very thin!"
Just received my shipment today. The top fit really good but the bottoms are too big . I plan to return and get a XL ( I'm 5'4 155lb)
My almost two-year old wore this to a special family event and was absolutely stunning.  She stole the evening
"Tiny bit large, but I think one wash will fix that. Very nice fabric."
"Love the color,look and comfort..so happy with my purchase."
It is perfect! It is for an adult or child. It's big but light weight. Only the worthy should buy it.
"cute, fit my 21 month old well"
Nice and very well made jeans.
"This is a pretty large bag.  It's got lots of pockets...just have to get used to the sides flopping in, until you get it filled up with your travel gear!"
Love this bag I always get compliments on it !!
Great work shirts. Heavy duty.
"Very nice no show socks.  Also, made in Korea....which is good."
"I burn VERY easily and am allergic to just about every sunscreen. This is perfect for me. I keep it in my car to wear when my top is down. I can now enjoy my convertible. I also wear it during my walks/hikes. It keeps me incredibly cool. Since this is the first UV  wear I have ever owned, I did not know what to expect. Well I am now a true believer and will be ordering multiple items from this line."
This was just the little bit of wrap I needed to feel more comfortable in my sleeveless dress for my daughter's wedding.
Perfect quality! Description is exact! You will be pleased!
Nice bag... But could be a little wider
I love this cami!  The thing that drew me to it in the first place was that it didn't have one of those annoying shelf bras in it.  I am rather large up top and have found those shelf bras to be extremely annoying... always hitting me in the wrong place and causing a line through the center of my bust.  This top was perfect and now I can wear blouses open a bit with this underneath.  I plan to purchase more of these for fall!
"I really like these shoes.  They're perfect casual shoes that go with anything.  They are warm because of the water-resistant material which can be a good or bad thing depending on the climate where you live.  They are very comfortable, but not as cushiony as Converse (although much lighter and more flexible).

I would definitely buy again."
"I'm a female, but I love big comfy sweatpants! I'm 5'4"" and 128lbs and I purchased a Medium because I wanted them to hang a little bit on me and this size is perfect! They are fuzzy on the inside, fit my waist perfectly, and long enough that I can tuck my feet inside the bottoms if I want. I just wish they had pockets."
"This coat definitely runs small. Im 5.6 and 185lbs, my sizes are 12/14. I ordered the XL based on other reviews. It fits but is a little snug in the hips, if you are not curvy or have no booty it will fit you just fine."
Very nice fit and feel.  Recommend highly.
Reordered item in correct size.
"I haven't used them, my little girl isn't here yet
 But I love them there so soft and cute and the owl is sown on so they won't come off in the washer."
well made very nice
Wife loves these and the matching necklace.
"Colors were ok but definitely more guy oriented than for a girl.  Look brighter in the pics on Amazon than what they actually were.  It's all good, product was as expected."
"Got these on an amazon sale for $18. Grey color looks good, fit well, slightly contoured and comfortable. Don't slip much when wet"
"Great, love the chain and can take if from casual to dressy, can't wait to use it for my outings!!"
guess I judge her size incorrectly but like the feel and quality
"Just got this a couple days ago.  Every time my wife flies back to her hometown, it's hit or miss whether her large suitcase will be over or under the 50 lb. weight limit.  This should help, although I haven't tried it yet with a loaded suitcase.

I also had an ulterior motive for purchasing this.  I play, and have several, bass guitars.  Whenever I buy or sell one, the first question usually asked is, ""How much does it weigh?""  Now I'll have a pretty fair estimate.  I weighed my basses this morning, and this scale appears to be pretty accurate.  My only concern is that because there isn't anything on the bass itself to hook onto the hanger part of the scale, I weighed them with the straps on.  But when I tried to weigh one of the straps by itself to see how much weight it added to the total weight of the bass, it isn't heavy enough to register on the scale.  So I'll probably just deduct one ounce from the weight I get of the bass with the strap on.

It does appear to be more accurate with heavier objects like a suitcase.  So all-in-all, I'm glad I got this.  It should be very helpful when flying."
"Received and matched to many bras that I'd ""outgrown."""
"Update: have used in snow. Works great.

Haven't used it in the weather yet but i ordered it for my 5'4"" 180lb husband and it was fine in length but tight in his middle. Not a big deal because i can use it instead. I'm 5'7"" 160lbs and it fits perfect."
"Great for the money, nice suede."
"Pretty, comfortable, and fun...but not to be worn without something covering ur fanny. Too thin in the light color."
Very cute and well made! Fits as expected!
I love love love this cozy ensemble.  Top & bottom are made well.  The colors and materials are perfectly soft and gorgeous.  I love these pjs.
"Love how this looked! A little cheaply made, but it was cute!"
My 15 year old is gathering items for his steampunk Halloween costume & this is the perfect addition.
Love these. Will wear everyday. Bought to replace real diamond earring that I'd lost.
"Let me be clear here. I do love this product, but it is simply much too expensive for a repeat purchase. I use the Image line and it works just as well for a quarter of the price. I do not have a big problem with wrinkles. It's sagging that is more problematic for me. I am going to be 52 and my skin is relatively smooth, but the jowls are beginning to show. I also have lots of brown spots. I need a very good cream for sagging, but I really don't think one exists. If any one of you ladies knows of one, I sure would appreciate your feedback!"
Beautiful and accurate. Indiglo face great for bedside nightstand and hotel nights.
These are very comfortable sandals! I get compliments whenever I've worn them and people have asked me where I got them. Definitely recommend.
"This bag is soo nice and it looks expensive, i get a lot of compliments for it. its a little bit smaller than i expected but i still love this bag and it arrived on time"
Super cute! Wore them all day with no problems!
"If you're worried about size, these were some of the only ""carry-on"" bags that actually came close to fitting the size requirements. Had no problem carrying them on internationally with Delta, and with smaller European budget airlines. You'll only have an issue if you overstuff it or put things in the outside pockets, then the width will get too big.
They survived the abuse of old cobblestone streets and repeated walks of 20 minutes or more. The wheels are great, and it's easy to transition the way you're pulling it, or to go from pulling to pushing very smoothly without the wheels catching. Still managed to fit way more than I needed for a 2 week trip (though we had access to a washer and took a clothes line)."
"ELEGANT, PRECISE AND VERY LIGHT. I WILL RECOMENDED."
"Fit great, gave it four stars because is a peach color not pink."
Shoes are very comfortable. Heel height is nice for wearing all day. Highly recommend.
Cute and versatile. Great fit. Comfortable for high heels. Easy to walk in.
Very happy with the costume and how fast we received it everyone loved it.
Bought as a gift.  She loved them.  Read reviews and ordered one size bigger.  That was a good thing they fit her just right.
"This dress was perfect for my event! I am 34 with three kids, and was looking for an elegant gown to wear to a ball. This dress made me feel great without being overly sexy or exposed. I received so many compliments all night, and no one could believe it was a $40 Amazon dress! I used the size chart pictured and ordered accordingly, and the fit was perfect. I used a hand-held steamer to get the wrinkles out of the skirt. Amazon dress for the win!"
I was scared it would be too small. I am 5'4. 180 lbs and very busty. Careful with the zipper it has mind of its own.
"Super comfy! Nice elegant look! Great heel height (2.5""), no tugging or uncomfortable spots. Nice cushion inside. Great for all day wear in a cold office!"
"Slightly bigger than the other zysun so also holds my iPad (air 2) and mega stuff, seems very durable.  I love the option of the shorter handles or the long strap for over the shoulder or cross body.  Great color and very versatile."
I ordered this blazer for my son to use for debate class events so I did not want to spend top dollar for something he would grow out of in a few months. I came folded in soft mailer with a hanger.  I took it out and it was completely wrinkle free!  The fabric was very nice too. My husband wears suits every day and noticed that is was super 150 fabric which has a very high end feel. It is a darker navy which I like.  I am very impressed and super satisfied.  My husband wants to see other products made by the same maker.
"It is comfortable, warm, well built, and looks good. It kept my bald head toasty warm in sub-zero temperatures...what more could you ask for?"
Super soft & comfy!!
perfect fit. I have a plus size chest so this looks a really good fit for me. I love it.
"Bought for my son and although a tad large for the size, he loves the shirt-breathes very well and comfortable to wear."
"I recommend it, it is beautiful"
Good quality and service glad I  purchased.
Bought these for my husband and he loves them!  He has VERY large hands and the gloves fit him perfectly.  Seem to be high quality.
Haven't wear it yet but I love it.
This is a very nice shirt. I have allergies to dyes so I always have to wash clothing before wearing. I washed this in cool water and put in dryer on low for just a few minutes to de-wrinkle. It came out nice and fits perfectly.
My daughter loves.  Pretty enough for evening clutch.
"As always, these are the best. My cats love these. Have bought them for years."
Great set of pants however they do run small so order a size up!
great for the price and came fast! very cheap material but just as I expected.
It is exactly what I wanted - and expected.
"Most comfortable shoe I've ever put on my feet. I'm a shoe snob & have always had feet issues since being born with bunions. Despite having foot surgery, I still have issues with my bunions. I own several pairs of Keens but these are my favorite!"
"I bought this for my Matron of Honor with plenty of time to get something else if I didn't like it....I LOVE it!  It is bigger and heavier than it appears.  By heavier, I mean that it is much sturdier than I expected.  It is built will, it is beautiful and it is very reasonably priced.  I like it so much I am going to buy one for ME!  :)"
"The photo doesn't do these shoes justice. They're more of a bootie and quite attractive when worn.  They fit well right out of the box.  I was very pleased with my purchase.  They're look nice with a pair of tights and a dress, but would also look good with some slacks or jeans, too."
"For the price, you can't beat the style and comfort level of these shoes."
So happy I got this Fraless Collection Roomy. My winter bag:-) thank you
"These shoes were a bit tight in the front when I first wore them but are comfortable now after a few times. They are also beautiful on the foot, the color looks great."
"After enjoying some southern California sunshine and warm weather, I returned home to cold, snowy, rainy weather; giving me an opportunity to evaluate this Saiveina umbrella sent to me in exchange for an honest evaluation and review.  It's neither too big and bulky like a doorman's umbrella nor too small.  There is a powerful spring in the handle that will quickly open this umbrella at the push of a button and then collapse it with another push of the button.  Compressing the handle cocks the spring that provides the double action.

Yesterday, while using this umbrella to protect me from a rainstorm while walking from my car to a nearby building, I encountered an violent gust of wind that turned it inside out.  Considering the intense force of the wind gust, I expected the umbrella to be bent and damaged but it was not.  When I pressed the button on the handle, the umbrella retracted normally from it's inverted condition and was completely unharmed.  When closed, this umbrella is just 12 1/2 inches long, making it easy to stow under the seat of a car, in a briefcase, handbag or backpack.  The fabric dries quickly.  When open it's large enough to keep me dry when I'm not in a windy rain.  Despite its tough construction, this umbrella weighs just 13 ounces, making it easy to recommend."
"Good quality fabric for price, good stitching, good zipper. I bought a size 5XL. Fit me okay but was a little small. I am 5'8"" tall (172 cm), 230 lbs (102 kg), and fairly long-waisted. Bust is 45.5"" (116 cm), waist is 39"" (99 cm), hips are 44"" (112 cm)."
"Family has large heads, so this may not be fair.  Cute hat, just too small"
Best chef shoes ever.  Comfortable even after 10 hours on my feet!
"This is a great bra. It fits and holds as a sports bra should without squeezing the air out of me. I have a larger chest, and I usually hate the sports bras with underwires, but this one is very comfortable without the straps being super wide (always an issue with the larger cup sizes). I don't feel like I'm in a straightjacket with this one, and the fact that it's convertible to racerback makes it very versatile."
this was exactly what I was looking for and arrived as promised.
"very comfy, wife loves them, esp rubber soles, good for the walk out to the hot tub"
"I didn't know what to expect really, but when I unwrapped the pendant it took my breath away! It is such a deep beautiful blue, it seems to glisten; the ""bow"" of Swarovski crystals sets it off beautifully. The chain is the right weight and strength for the pendant and comes with a 2"" extension should you want it longer.  I am very happy with this purchase."
"I bought a medium and I think they are a little see through, but I am also 23 weeks pregnant so I'm sure they won't be as see through when I lose a little weight. Over all nice"
"The rose tone color is on point, the bracelet appears to be well made, is very pretty and the price was economically feasible. The bracelet can be worn with jeans or a cocktail dress to a formal affair."
LOVE this hat for my husband. He never wore hats before but wears this every day. Keeps its shape and he says its very comfortable. Fit perfectly.
"I just love this brand, they are great. The sandals are soft and comfy and perfect for just running errands around town. I love them."
Fits great and keeps me cool. Did seem to wear out somewhat quick and stain quick. But I have this issue with a lot of undershrits I wear.
"Ive had a pair for less than 3 months. Within the first month the shoe strings needed replacing. After the second month the insides started falling apart. I don't know if that usually happens with these types of boots, but Id expect them to at least last six months. The Steel toe is very strong. My foot has been ran over by a forklift and nothing happened. (Dont do that) is advise to treat waterproof before wearing them."
"Exactly what I was hoping for and you can't beat the price! I ordered a large to be on the safe side (5'4"") - Usually a medium but I wanted to make sure this wasn't too snug based on the other reviews."
"Perfect for my needs.  I wear it when walking daily to hold my keys, phone, tissues and lip balm.  Just a basic fanny pack."
"Love my boots  ,they are very comfy just what I was hoping for"
It's beautiful piece of shemagh and an authentic one.
this is a beautiful necklace love it
Comes  un buckled all the time already lost a piece of it
"This watch is so SEXY . I have had several Family / Friends inquire where I purchased it AMAZON of course.
I have been looking for a animal print watch with SEX APPEAL, and this is the WATCH !!!!
Purchased 2 watches 1 for you and one for a family or friend who needs some SEX APPEAL !!!!!
I LOVE THIS WATCH !!!!!
It was delivered when promised and I have been wearing ever since THANKS AMAZON you hit the nail on the head with this DYNAMIC PIECE !!!!"
Fun Colorful Comfortable.  I love my new socks.  They wash well too.
Not your typical style of asics shoes. I really like them. Very cute and the gold makes the shoes. Very comfortable.
I love this and the support it gives me while wearing my breasts when I cross dress.  Definitely will buy again.
Way too big!!!  If I buy this brand again I'll know to order a size smaller than I normally wear!!!
Perfect and beautiful shoes
it was just a little large in the breast area
Great school uniform pants.  I purchased 5 pairs for my grandson.  The quality of these pants is superior.  I would definitely recommend and purchase these pants again.
i am a fan that is all i can say well gotta go times up great watch!!
Still with the double lining up top - there isn't much support - but good enough to kick around in the back yard or to wear underneath something else.
Super comfy and cute. I own several Clarks sandals and I wear them all day long without feeling tired at all.  They look so stylish. I get compliments.  The color is really nice.
They fit as expected and are pretty good. The color came out a bit darker than I was expecting from the picture but I am otherwise quite happy with the purchase.
"Very pretty and soft.

Things to consider:
1. The cowl part of the neck drapes off my shoulder revealing bra straps if you are wearing a camisole or tank top underneath.
2. It fits snug to size, so you can't wear something thick under the sweater. If you want to layer thickly, buy a size larger than what you usually wear.
3. It is a sweater and slightly bulky, looking sexy will be difficult, but looking cute is easy :-)"
Good to sleep in.
I bought this for my 13 year old granddaughter.  She really liked it. The watch has 2 snaps to adjust for size. The price was great and it is very unique.
"Just buy a
Little."
"I don't use deodorants with aluminum in them. Research has shown they are not good for us and I do think there are some health repercussions. I liked this deodorant. It smells nice and went on well. Worked well too.

If you have been using aluminum deodorants it may take a little while for a non- aluminum one to work. It's almost like you have to get them out of your system for others to work.

I liked the scent of this one, it went on smoothly, and it worked well for me. Recommended."
Fit and wear just like the GoWalk 2's but with canvas uppers as opposed to the nylon mesh. Extremely light and comfortable.
My 20 month old likes these shoes.  They don't seem to cause him to trip and fall as other bulky shoes do. They are easy to take on and off and they can get wet.  They fit his fat feet.  The only problem I have noticed is they do have the smelly feet smell after my son wears them as there is really nothing to absorb the sweat but that is expected.
"nice, soft fabric and good fit. while the bra cup easily unclips for breastfeeding, it is nearly impossible to reattach one handed because of the bulk of the strap behind the clasp. perhaps it will get easier as it softens with wear? still a useful piece of clothing."
"Comfortable,  but  cups a little  small. They do not cover fully if your busty. Wear  when you want cleavage. I will keep  but it does not fit as well as some others."
It was itchy like other reviews said but solved that problem by putting a shirt under it but it runs small
Shoe fits well!  Like them very much!
Well made and color was exactly as it appears! I bought 2 different colors and will probably buy another at a later date! So soft to the touch! Love it!
I wear a 6 but ordered a 6 1/2 because Sketchers run narrow. They fit perfect and are the most comfortable shoes I own.
This is maybe the 4th item I've purchased from this seller. The ring itself fits great even though it's a tad big (definitely not big enough to slide off) and the crystals sparkle like crazy. Perfect compliment for my 1 carat solitaire while I get a replacement wedding band. Will continue purchasing from this seller!!
"I'm so glad I ignored the negative reviews stating these fit too small, when I ordered them. A sports bra is supposed to fit a little snug to support properly. If that's not what you want then you want a ""leisure"" bra!
These fit TRUE TO SIZE! Its actually the first sports bra for someone over a ""c-cup"" that fits without the twins popping out thru the top.
Will definitely be getting more of these."
warm keeps heat in
"I ordered a half size larger after reading
reviews and the fit was perfect.  Lots
of cushioning in the heels which is an issue for me because of plantar fasciitis.
Got a sale price which helps. Only complaint is laces are very short."
I ordered this for myself when I was tired of my plain black wallet.  I have used it for a few months so far and it is wearing well.  I read on here that some found the card slots to be too hard to use.  I have not found this to be true and I have a card in every slot.
I really like that color of the emerald stones. I had to use a little bit of clear nail polish because some of the stones moved and I didn't want to risk them falling out.
"PerfectDay
Perfectday 3 Pack No Show Socks Cotton Socks these socks are really comfortable to wear..they fit perfectly and very breathable socks..i love the no show designs since i wear low cut shoes..they are very neat and simple...i just love wearing them..they keep my fit warm and protected ..they look cool when im wearing my black leggings..im satisfied with the quality of these no show socks..i recommend this product to you

i received this product for free or purchased it in a discounted price in exchange of me giving or writing my unbiased review for this particular product."
Perfect but is a little too small.  Exact size of  credit card. Should be a little bigger.
I have a large wrist and this clasp has made wearing my watch much more comfortable and easier to put on/remove. I will be buying more for my other watches.
This has been a fun mask to wear. I am 6ft and 255 lbs so it was a little tight on my head. It was delivered alone in a box and the ears were a little creased. I ended up stuffing polyester fill in the ears to make them look full.  I also used some black face paint around the eyes to look even better.
"These shoes are excellent for running, walking in water. They are stable shoes that won't slide off.
I have bought 3 pairs of pool shoes in 1 year and these are the best ones."
Does have a latex smell but its bearable. Fit snug as it should. Got it a size larger because I am post partum. Sucks it all in as it should. After loosing weight I will buy the next size down
"Very nice material and great fit, looks great on my boyfriend"
"So comfortable, I forgot I was wearing hosiery! And this was after not wearing hose in a very long while. I was going to a evening wedding and wanted to feel elegant.  And I did."
"This is a little on the bigger side, so I wish I had ordered a 6 instead of an 8. But, for the amazing deal I got, I will keep this even though it's a little big.  Very classy looking, and I got a lot of compliments on it.  I've only worn it the one time so far."
what a great hoodie...nice material....warm...soft to touch....great looking...got it in olive and i plan to get more...overall an excellent buy at an excellent price
These shoes stay on the 18-month old better than any other sandal we have tried. See Kai Run makes excellent products.
These are extremely comfortable and a great flip flop for the price.  I normally wear a size 7 1/2 shoe so ordered an 8 and they fit perfectly.  I will be ordering again in other colors!
las camisetas son hermosas
Fine cotton tank top for hot summer days.
"I'm very happy, if it did shrink it was next to nothing. Most shirts I get the arms seem to shink and I end up with just another rag."
"It's nice ,just a little large."
I have worn NYDJ's for a long time  I usually buy the Marilyn style because they fit and are comfortable and make me look a size smaller---Yea Yea
Fits great. True to size.
"Great shirt, nice and comfortable, I'm very happy with the purchase because it is good quality."
My husband loves them and they are true to size!
"Got for a friend, they loved them!"
"These are classy shoes and were very comfortable on the ball of the foot ... Just a little short on toe room, but that's probably because I have a slight hammer toe on my right foot, which is a little bit bigger than my left. If I hadn't found something more comfortable (to the tune of almost 3 times the cost) I probably would have kept these Easy Streets."
I have to say that I am pleased with the color and the size of these pants.  I would recommend this product to others.
"Very cute. I like that they are gender neutral. Made of nice leather, good for walks."
"I like it overall, just the heel is a little higher than expected."
High quality item and fast delivery
"Comfortable and effective, nice to have it for a day of rain and snow."
"Exactly the one I need for several approaching international trips. Very light weight and comfortable to wear. My passport(in a cover) just fits with lots of room for cash, cards and other necessities you want to take on a jaunt around a strange city. I am traveling to Europe where pick pockets are rampant and so clever that they can steal from your bag - or cut the strap so quickly you will not realize it until it's too late..  If this belt is worn under clothing no one will ever know you have it on much less be able to steal from it without your knowledge"
"I wear ASICS trainers at work (color:  black).  I chose pink Cross-Trainers for my days off.  They are somewhat more expensive than Puma in the similar style, but ASICS fit better and have better sole support.  ASICS are always worth it due to the fact that I have a bunion.  The toe box fits well."
"Really great watch! As another reviewer mentioned, the face is very reflective, but it's not really a problem when it comes to seeing the time. The band is great, and nicely reinforced with gold bits around the watch face, which is a place that often weakens with a watch worn often. This would make a great gift since it is so versatile."
"This was a gift, to my eleven year old granddaughter.  She's maturing, and I believe these sets of  matching undergarments an excellent introduction, to a support bra, in the future.  I remember the awkward feelings, when I was a teen.  Hopefully, this will give our young  lady more confidence as she goes through adolescence.  With a nice selection of colors, seem well made, and may purchase more of the same, if she does incorporate these in her dressing."
I bought this for my boyfriends birthday and the color is even nicer in person. I will buy again from this company.
"Just received this gorgeous bag today and I love it. Can't say enough good things especially since this is my 6th handbag and second one of this style that I have ordered from this company. These bags are so functional, well made and the leather is beautiful. Have one in gray and ordered another in purple. Definitely have a yen for these leather bags...You see Parisian women walking around Paris with one of the ridiculously over priced leather handbags just like this one..."
My son loves these shorts for school and play and its actually fashionable among young people.
Perfect wedding ready
My 4 year old loves this dress and please don't take that lightly because she is super picky. It is silky smooth and made great for the price.
"I originally purchased these in navy and black. They're great. Soft, warm, comfortable and good looking. If worn like the picture of the model they come up a couple inches above my knee - not quite as high as shown. I came back to order the tan ones - I don't have those yet but I'm hopeful they'll be great too. Highly recommend!"
Super cute and not cheap looking
"Very nicely made, wash well"
"Not sure how durable. Did not come in original box, but not worn.  Came with more sensible shoes strings to change out.  Grossman ribbons are sweet.  There was visible glue around rubber and funny looking zigzag stitching on tongues.  These are probably seconds but still cute and fine with purchase.  4 year old is supper happy with them."
My husband loves the watch .
4 yr old loved it! Mask is hard and somewhat to see out of. HE BELIEVES!
"There are other bracelets for men on here that I would definitely recommend that are better. but this is not too bad as I said and In the headline.

My only complaint would be the strings our kinda of strong. so if you have really thick wrist; you might pop them off. But you can use the strings to adjust the tightness of the bracelet. Just be very careful"
"Very nice looking shoes, very comfortable and light on my feet. CAT did a good job with these. Holding them alone even they feel they are built tough but in a way that does not compromise style and comfort.  Does not feel like safety shoes at all. My previous safety shoes were a Red Wing, felt like a brick on feet. I would even wear them for everyday activity."
Very nice color and fabric but the Large is too large in my opinion. I wear a size 14 and its too big on me.
Very cute on .  Fits well and washes well.
"I normally wear a 16 to 1X top and the 1X has plenty of room every where. It could also double as a cute maternity top without looking like a maternity top. The color is really nice. I would call it a Periwinkle color. The material is very soft and thin with LOTs of stretch for summer days. I Like the 3/4 sleeves. Not see through material.

I really love Lucky brand Women's tops, but I don't think this is a good fit for me with the baseball shirt type shoulders. It just makes me look bigger than I am. X1 is my size though, maybe I am too old or busty to wear it. The model has much broader shoulder than me, and it hangs well on her.
I can't really take stars away because the product doesn't suit me. I am sure it would look nice on many women. It really is a nice T to wear with Jeans."
"I read some reviews stating these were cut larger.  Normally where 36x32 levis, so I bought 34x32 pants.  Length was fine, waist was too tight.  I received these as a gift for Christmas.  Called Amazon about an exchange, and they sent me new pair of 36x32s, which fit perfectly.  I did not even have to return the ones I received as a gift.  Amazon told me to just donate them to charity.  Way to go Amazon!  Excellent service."
Best boots ever for keeping feet warm. As comfortable as slippers. Have several pairs in different colors.
Perfect fit and wonderfully made!!  Great price!!!
"I used this for Halloween costume as Lumpy Space Princess, it's a very good wig, just as is in picture."
Solid leather belt with no frills.
"Nice dress,  it fits pperfectly,  looks classy and the  material is not cheap."
This was another deal of the day sale item and was priced at about half of what they were selling it for at Macy's. Really prettier once you get to see it. My daughter said they were really comfortable but so are most Aerosoles.
"These are great little slippers to wear around the house. You can also slip them into your purse to take with you if know you are going to a friend's house where you have to take your shoes off. Carry them along to wear if you are going on a long flight.  They are washable. I typically where a size 9 shoe, so I bought the Large for size 8-9 and they are a good fit. They are durable. Also, I am attaching a picture to show you the bottom of a slipper. You will see an  L  on the bottom.  That means it is for the left foot.  The other slipper says R.  Nice to know there is a very slight difference."
These are the most comfortable shirts I have ever bought from amazon.  You will not be disappointed with this product.  It deserves a five star plus rating.
I purchased this for my niece as a gift for the birth of her daughter.  I wanted her to have something very special and this was it.  It says it all and is completely beautiful.  I am very glad I purchased this for such a wonderful occasion.
"These are great I wear them all the time. I had a problem with the shrink to fit, but these fit great."
"Cute ring. The metal frame of the ring doesn't look that great, but the stone is so pretty and shiny, it makes up for it. Good ring for a cheap price"
"Beautiful green stone, makes you feel good when you wear it!"
"Soft, light weight, rich colour (red), and flows beautifully. Arm length is perfect, but then I'm 6'4 so everything is relative. Perhaps if you're average height you'll find them a little long.

Wash alone or with like colours before wearing; the dye runs a little."
I love these shoes. I wore them all weekend at a music festival. No blisters or any other problems. Perfect for dancing and walking all day in the heat. They do run a little big. I ended up needing a half size smaller than I normally wear.
This is an Awesome onesie! I Love the soft fabric it looks awesome on my blue eyed baby boy!! Absolutly love this
They were good quality and fit.
Love it!! Soo cute
This was for my 8yr old and fit her perfect. We got the med/large. I highly doubt it would fit any teens this is like a 14/16 in kids sizes. Super cute costume.
I got an XS. It was a bit uncomfortable to get on. Once on it looked very cute. Nice style .
These nursing shirts are everything.  I don't have to cover my child or leave the room for privacy and it's oh so cute.
Very elegant received many complements bangle not tight very comfortable
This outfit was super cute and I was surprised at the quality for the price:)
I am satisfied with my purchased. Warm and cozy
I bought several of these breastfeeding shirts as they are so so amazing! Practically living in them right now. Very soft and easy to access in and out. The only bad part is the opening in front sometimes exposes eveeything. Definitely need a tank underneath if going out in public.
"These shoes are great, the fit is perfect and they are comfortable.  I have a pair in camel and in dark brown.  I'm watching for a pair in black too.  Plus the price was great!"
"Trying to lose weight so I can wear it, very cute, I'm just far too fat."
perfect for my cosplay and beautiful shimmer
Came as ordered. Didn't shrink during washing/drying process. Will definitely be ordering more!!
It met all my expectation.  I needed for a Mask photo shoot on models.  It was a metal but quite flexible to bend to adjust to model face.  It was beautiful and classy.
I purchased a 2x. I normally wear a lg-xl but I wanted it roomy for longer meditations.
"funny smell but it seem high quality leather and its securely nicely woven, it looks and feels like it will last a long time. thank you WEST."
nicely made and worked well for our dress up event
"These are a great classic shoe for a fair price.  I love the faux suede, although I don't know how easy it would be to clean. . .  They fit pretty well, although after a few hours of standing they were starting to rub my poor pinky toes.  They came with foam removable pads for extra padding under the ball of the foot, but when I tried to put those in, the shoes were way too tight across the top.  Overall I'm pleased, although I could never wear these all day."
Love these!! Extremely comfortable.
All girls liked them.
"Beautiful, nice leather and I love it! I wear it sometimes, though"
I feel very sexy in these shoes
Wonderful suede jacket that fits perfectly and looks a million dollars. Very chic
A total Mod must have.
Great shirt. My daughter received many compliments. She flash-danced it and it is a great look. Material is soft. Runs a bit small.
"These jeans are excellent quality and really cute, but they are HUGE!  The size tag says ""9 husky"", but it also says ""29x25"" and I have never seen this dual sizing."
You cannot go wrong with this beautiful blue topaz cross! The price is unbeatable along with the earrings and ring. All three are a perfect match for your wife! Doesn't have to be a special occasion. Make one by purchasing these three items.
Well made and cute as can be.
Got this for a Student for his birthday. ... The sword is sharp just FYI. I didn't know this until the student started treating everyone like a Chuchu and I had to take it away until school got out. :/
This dress is soooo beautiful!!  The quality is excellent!!
"Really cute, but wasn't sure about sizing. It is more like a juniors fit. I normally am a medium, so that's what I bought. It fits, but a tighter fit. I would have been more comfortable in a large."
Great for the price.  Bought two pair.
Love them...fits perfect!
"The sizes are not consistent, but the patterns are GREAT!! I get lots of compliments when I wear these."
"Very warm, light, well made boots. They run slightly big to the size. But boots shouldn't be too tight and I wear with insoles so I am happy with this size.(size 8. I wear 8 or 7 1/2)
Great value. They came on time by Fedex. I think Fedex is better than UPS, they sent me the notice of arrival on the actual arrival day."
Great light weight beach/workout tank
"I love it, good price and fit. I plan on buying more."
The shoes fit great and are very comfortable with great stability.
"this sneaker is for my 4 year's old daughter, and I think the color is more beautiful than picture. and it's worth buying."
Alfred Dunner always fits as expected. Very good basic pant to wear with a variety of pretty tops.
Good. Sizes run small though...No scratch problems or cloudiness like others have reported.
"I love these, I am not at all used to wearing sandals, but these have not hurt my feet or in between my toes at all and are very comfy to wear. you can wear with shorts or pants. I love them."
I hoped this would fit and it did.  A little adjustment to the inseam and this will finish the costume I'm putting together.
Excellent product! A+
I love these shoes!  They are so comfortable and dress up nicely.  I like sandals so my feet are not used to being contained but these don't bother my feet.  They also travel well and don't take up much weight or space in a suitcase.
Cute and comfy booties...so far.  I haven't had a chance to wear them all day so I can't say the comfort level on them to that degree.
"Good fit, good value.  I have purchased these shorts before and they fit well, don't wrinkle and keep their good looks after many wearings."
"I am very happy with this purse.  I prefer hobo bags and this one is just the right size.  It looks rich and the color is perfect ( the color in the photo matches the color of the bag).  It says it is leather but it doesn't have that ""leather smell.""  I question that but it does look like leather.  It has a different smell to it but it's not bad and it went away in a short time.  It may be the shipping wrap that they use.  It still does not smell like leather though.  What I really like is the lining.  It appears to be satin and it is sewn in very tightly and does not hang loose when I'm digging in the bag for something.  I love that!  There is plenty of room for just about anything you would want to carry.  I don't really need the extra long strap since the shorter strap is plenty long to go over my should and can be adjusted in length.  If you love hobo bags you will love this one!"
"Jacket is made of great material, fits well and looks good. The length of the jacket is perfect and I like that the sleeves have Velcro to adjust the ends. Plus, for the price, this jacket is a great buy."
It's perfect. Very durable
"I was skeptical, but I ordered it anyway due to the sale price. I'm so happy I did! It's warm, fits perfectly and the hoodie stays in place."
"Love the fabric!  Fits a little large but I ordered large.  My experience has been that scrub tops run small.  I like to have room in my shoulders when moving/lifting patients.  I love the HeartSoul products and ordered another set.  I do wish there was a better way of choosing matching material.  I.E Cotton from the other material which is not indicated on the label.  You have to look closely at the image to see if its the same material, which can be tricky!"
"Light weight crew sock that's perfect for the warm climate where I live. Fits well. Very comfortable. The one negative is the lack of any reinforcing around the heel or the toe area, so they wear out fairly quickly. Still, the price is right."
I just received this bracelet two weeks early. Really good quality for such a low price.  Comes in a cute little pouch.  Buy extras because you're going to want to give them as gifts.
This item was a christmas present for my daughter.  Got it at the last minute and received it before xmas. Very happy.
"i purchases this socks after reading a comment on how they fit adult size although they are offered for kids.
It is true!!! I am a US size 38 (women) and they fit perfectly.
seems good quality, of course it is soon to say since I have wash them only once, however they have perfect shape and fabric seems untouched after the machine wash and dry cycle.
Ahhh, and of course, you can bit the price."
It looks much more expensive than it is.  Husband loves it!
"I bought this for my 6 year old granddaughter for Christmas.  She loved it and wears it all the time.
  The added bonus is the adorable container it comes in, which she also loves."
I bought this for my step mom for Mothers Day and she loved it.
So cute my co-workers are jealous!
"i love ,love this i worked out for less than an hour and i had alot of sweat. its better if you get Albolene Moisturizing Cleanser and rub it around your stomach and  wrap it with plastic wrap and work out with this vest on. i was dripping sweat everywhere.. I am 5'2 and i weight around 160 the large felt good around the breast area it was tight but the stomach area it was kinda loose. so i just ordered a medium. But yes i recommend this. I have seen a difference in my stomach.  Drinks lots of water since you will sweat alot."
I bought these for my nephew who works in a refrigerator cooler.  He says they keep him warm without being bulky.  He also says they launder well.
Bought this watch for my grandson. He was looking at the same model watch I'm the mall except silver with gold accents. When he saw the gold watch he fell on love with it. The gold isn't a deep gold so it doesn't look gaudy. Quality is good also. Would definitely recommend this watch.
Not bad for $40/dollar boots! Use them for yard work!
"Good value, nice belt. Frayed end is in the design, not a malfunction, but I wish it was covered in leather such as regular web/canvas belts. However it has a great look and feel, wears nicely."
"I ordered medium size. They are on the roomier side so I am thinking small size would have done just fine. But since I use them to lounge around the house, the looser fit works well for my needs. If you order the correct fit, they are good enough to wear outsides. The style is very flattering. The material is nice & soft. The color is true to the picture. Even after washing, they look as good as new. I would recommend them."
Was given as a gift and Granddaughter seemed to like it - nice and light weight.
Very comfortable and good looking. These shoes meet all my needs and they have a quality look about them. I would recommend this shoe
"I ordered size 9/10 first and my toes were right at the end of them and I didn't like that, size 11 was the perfect fit!!! They are such a good price I gave my others away as a small gift to one of my girl friends instead of returning them and loved them :)"
"These are pretty awesome. They're seriously comfortable, and very lightweight. I dropped one star because the legs are too short to be considered boxer briefs. They're more of a 'trunk' cut in the legs."
"Very homely. Not even a nod to femininity. Basic cotton gown, softens with wear and wash as well as the hem stops at the mid calf area. Good quality and well made."
My husband loves this shirt.  He says it's soft inside and warm.
These are the best leggings that I have purchased and I have purchased A LOT lately trying to find the right fit. These were perfect! Very comfortable!
"I love wearing Rainbows! There is a breaking in period with these sandals. When I first get them I have to wear them around the house to break them in and in short stints. They will hurt your feet at first but it is totally worth it. Be patient and they will be great. If you have a wide foot, avoid buying Rainbows. They are extremely narrow."
"Great Bra. Also used a bigger one during pregnancy.
Best bra Ever!"
Like style of shoe wish shaft were a little higher. Runs a little small can't wiggle my toes as much as I like. Doesn't really favor leather but I did buy this knowing it is man made. Overall good shoe.
I love this little pin and my grandma did as well! It is small but it is very pretty and the little message that comes on the box is very sweet.
"am 69 , and still working part time. work in a large warehouse pulling orders,have developed hammer toe and my feet were killing me covering 2 or 3 miles aday pulling orders. read some of the reviews on this shoe and thought would give them a try. they are just great , but like some of the reviews said buy a size larger and glad i did,try them you will love'm"
"Skechers have been my go to shoes and these are no exception.  Fits perfectly, super comfortable and cute!  I am going to have to find more colors."
"This costume is super cute, my daughters in a 3T and the x-small fit perfectly. My only complaint would be there's a crease in the hair piece from being folded in the package but hopefully I'll be able to fix it. She was super excited to try it on and didn't want to take it off!"
"My wife loved them, she has small earlobes and they fit her well."
"So these are great for the price.  They are really soft, comfortable and do offer a surprising amount of support (which is number one for me).  However, there are a couple really annoying flaws that would be deal breakers if it weren't for the fact that they are cheap.  The material that connects to the strap when the cup is unclipped and open is too stretchy and thin and doesn't keep the strap in place when nursing.  So the strap with the connection clip slips higher up on the shoulder and makes hooking back on after nursing really difficult.  I rarely can get it re-hooked with one hand. Very inconvenient when nursing in public since I have to set baby down somewhere before being able to re-hook my bra.  The one other issue I have with these are that the strap adjustments don't stay in place and slide down blocking the nursing clips.  So not only is it almost impossible to re-hook with one hand, the stupid strap adjustments get in the way too.  Such a dumb design flaw that could easily be solved if the straps adjusted in the opposite direction (from the back).  So yeah, the re-hooking problems of these bras would be total deal breakers it the sellers were trying to sell them for more money.  But since they're cheap, comfortable and supportive, I like them. Even with the annoying issues I still give them 4 stars bc I am very impressed by the incredible shape and lift these bras give, especially for being wireless.  They really look great on."
It is a great hat but not my style.  I returned it but recommend it to all who can pull it off
"Beautiful top, well made and washes well. Dresses up jeans nicely or looks great with dressier pants and skirts. Fits true to size, very reasonably priced and I will definitely order more from Sakkas!!! Very happy with this purchase."
Bought for traveling
"comfortable and light;

color is ok."
Fits as expected but kind of sheer.
LOVE THIS BRAND! The fit is always comfortable and the material is exceptional!
One of the most comfortable bras I've ever bought! Went out and bought two more in different colors!!
"The zebra print flower fell apart  but I wasn't planning on using it, not for awhile anyway so it doesn't really bother me"
Great colors and nice fit according to the chart.
Gorgeous top! I love the fit and flow and sparkle this top offers up. Perfect for the office in summer because it's always freezing cold in there. Thin enough to keep you cool while keeping your arms warm.
Cute the Boyfriend Loved them. I thought they be little big but they fit him perfectly. He couldn't be happier. Nice and soft best gift I got him so he say wears them often
"Beautiful wedding set.  Runs a little small, but still fits.  Nice every day piece of jewelry, would recommend.  Reasonably price.  Has lots of sparkle."
Great watch. No complaints! Love the bands you can switch out. Definitely recommend this product. Great for men and women.
Very nice looking vest. The only thing you need to be aware of is that you have to order the next size up. Im a muscular guy and I ordered the XL and it fits me well. Im usually a Large but these sizes run smaller.
"Could have been a little larger (I wear 34B bra), but then if it was it probably wouldn't stay up.  It was comfortable and did the job I bought it to do."
I am in sales and I have to stand on cement at trade shows for hours and my feet don't bother me in these shoes.  Ecco's to me is one of the best shoes out there.  I have worn about every other brand in the past 20 years and I still haven't found a shoe company that makes a better shoe at this price point.  These look nice with both business attire or even a pair of jeans.
Love it!! Get compliments all the time...
Somewhat large but love the fit for comfort. Wouldn't want it any smaller
Nice and soft. Bought as xmas present and the receiver LOVE it
"Fits as expected.  Love the shirt!!  Get lots of compliments, positive ones!!"
"I would not wear these out of the house. They are very comfortable, but they are also a little see-through. The material itself is soft and very stretchy. It's also pretty thin. So thin in fact that I may have to come back to update this review if they don't last very long. Despite washing instructions, I just threw them in with the rest of my laundry. They have been washed in a regular cold cycle and then dried on the regular/high heat setting on the dryer. And so far they've held up pretty well. These are supposed to be capri style pants, but they are only a couple of inches from touching the floor when I wear them. I mean I am 5' 1 1/2'' but still.

Full disclosure: I had the opportunity to purchase these leggings/yoga pants at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. This opinion is 100% my own and I have no affiliation with the seller of this product."
"This jacket is nice, love the color and fit. I'm 5'4 and 175lbs and the large size fits me perfectly (even the thumb holes hit at the right length). It keeps me warm without being too warm. Very comfortable."
Fits well and looks Dressy
"Love the quality, color and style."
Our sone loves these shoes. I son't personally see what is so great about them but out 18 year old son loves them. We remember these from when we were teenagers and so I guess history repeats itself :-)
"The shoes were what expected. They are expensive. But, they are for my daughter. Fit well and hold up pretty well."
Fit as expected. I'm normally a XL and the XL fits great.
"I order 1/2 size larger and it fit me as expected.
The shoes is good quality for the price that i paid.  Real wool, real leather and comfy.
It is good for LA weather during winter but I have not tried in the snow area.
The picture look darker than the actual shoes, so little bit dissapointed.  I will give five star if the color as shown on photos."
"Green is my favorite color and this is a dark olive, and shows really nice.  The two contrasting greens between the band and the different shade of green inside the bezel with the gold nut and strip accents on the watch make this really eye catching.  I have a decent watch collection, and think this is one of the favs.  It is a larger watch, and may feel bulky to people but that has not affected me at all.  I tend to like heavier watches and watches with the larger wrist pieces but I know that is not everyone's taste.  The only advice I have is to mind to the size.  If you tend to wear watches that are larger than this is the watch for you but if you like slim watches, this may not be your style."
"These are great 'granny panties' when used without the pads.  They fit tight, stay in place an no panty lines.
They are 'one size fits all' and I would say if you weigh over about 150 they're going to be too tight after you wash them."
These are size 14 but runs true to size unlike any other puma sneakers.  This is our second purchase of the same line (BMW MS Nyter).  Actual color is navy blue.  Happy with this purchase.
"I love this shirt! It's a very comfortable tee, and the writing is great! It fits as expected which I'm glad because some are made smaller than what the sizing shows. I'm not one to really buy clothes online without being able to try them on. I like 'thinner' teeshirts instead of the thick/stiff kind. This definitely meets my expectations. I wore this out and about and I got quite a few laughs and thumbs up. Afterall, who doesn't love BATMAN?! This shirt brought back some memories from my childhood when I used to watch Batman with my dad. The only problem with this shirt, I should've bought two, one for me and one for my husband because we 'fight' over who wants to wear it. I received this item in exchange for my honest review."
My prescription eye glasses are supposed to tint in the sunlight but they do not when driving my car.  My eyes start to have a 'burning' feeling on a bright sunny day so these LensCovers  allow me to keep my eyes open without the burning/blurring..
These boots are amazingly comfortable and particularly light (which is what stops me from usually purchasing boots).  I can wear these all day.  I have an orthotic that fits nicely into the boot and my foot does not get squished - a nice change.  They are great for office attire and jeans. Took me about 10 minutes to break them in.  The leather sole is definitely not for inclement weather - rain or snow - as it can be very slippery.
My daughter love these! They are cuter in person than I thought from the picture.
Love them! Ordered 2 more different colors.
"My daughter bought these for her sister, and she loved them!  Good quality socks, not cheaply made."
These were super cute but too snug a fit for my daughter. They run a bit small. I would recommend ordering 1 size bigger than normal for these shoes.
"I have several of these in a few colors, including ones with lace trim.  They are a great smoothing tank to wear under clothing.  The best thing about them is they are long enough!  They are not binding at the bottom, they have the bottom part looser, which is great design-wise.  The straps are adjustable.  But don't expect TOO much slimming effect, they smooth but are not as slimming as SPANX.  I am not a small woman, I'm 5'8"" a size 12 with a DDD chest, and I wear a MEDIUM in these.  The large or xl will not slim you at all unless maybe you're plus-sized 18 or over, so order down so it's tighter, you want to feel held in.

If you want cleavage, this doesn't show too much, but it's a plus in the top part for me because it's not tight up top and doesn't flatten me out.

Overall a good buy for light slimming and everyday wear."
It is very cute like the round shape all the details very expensive and love it
"This ring is just a beauty, has the look of a very expensive elegant engagement ring. I am certain folks will think it is real, it is so attractive and stands out. It ahines nicely in every angle and light and is very good quality. I think its perfect as a starter ring or for fashion for everyday or special occasions. It arrived very quickly and in a very unique jewelry box, not ring box but still perfect for gifting. I do have to get it resized down a size but I am very happy with it and highly recommend it for your someone special.
Item provided at a discount in exchange for my fair and honest review, all opinions are 100% my own."
"Great shoes, very sexy but WOW they are SO uncomfortable!!!!!!! Wear them only if you're sitting all evening or plan to take them off right away. Four inch heels with a bent toe and weird arches do not a comfy shoe make. Would not purchase again, but they are very very pretty :)"
"Really nice fabric, and true to color"
"Originally I rated this dress 4 stars but had to change it to 5 stars after wearing it. I felt 100% sexy but still classy in this dress. My date said it was sensory overload! I am also happy with the quality. It held up very well. I'm leaving my original review listed below. However, after getting the correct undergarment, I bought a waist trainer/cup-less corset to flatten my stomach and hide any buldges...it was a perfect fit plus the corset gave my breasts a lift since you can't wear a bra with this dress. The dress fit beautifully! I'm 5'4 132 lbs 36C.  If you're really skinny the one size fits all may be too loose.  It was perfectly tight but the thick material kept it smooth, the low v cut accentuated the girls and it was short showing off my legs and hugging my butt perfectly. It is a sexy dress..not for someone who is modest. The dress length would have shown my panties if I bent over. Probably the sexiest thing I own!

Original review: the dress could have fit a little tighter especially in the chest. Its definitely sexy..I will be wearing spanks for sure as it does show imperfections. I also read about the white piping popping up instead of laying down..that is happening but a little fabric tape should do the trick (i used a safety pin and the piping stayed flat and smooth). It is very short too."
Perfect flip flop!! Would highly recommend
Good quality product! Would buy again!
These are thick and soft and retain their integrity after washing.  Highly recommended.
Have always owned a timex. Wouldn't change. Very nice watch.
My son said this is the most comfortable pair of sneakers! He love it!
"Love the look of this watch,, overall easy to program if you read the instructions. Can't beat it for the price"
"Amazing watch, i love Swatch watches and this new watch is great, dial is a little smaller than i think but is ok, the colors and design are great, with pictures i was thinking that it could looks like an woman watch but no, is white but looks perfect for men.  I hope go to dive with this soon ;)"
A little big but still fit good and looked great
"Love this bag.  Its the perfect size.  One outside compartment for my iphone 8 S, and another for me Rigid wallet.  Yet another zipper inside and two compartments.  Highly recommend"
"a little dark, but still very pretty"
"I purchased these at a promotional rate for my two nieces.  They spend the weekends at my parents, and my parents are coffee drinkers.  My nieces always want to drink coffee with them, so my mom makes a kids' version (milk with some cocoa powder for color--essentially hot chocolate).  I received these today, and they are perfect!  They're so cute and well made.  They're a perfect size for them.  These wouldn't be a good size for a coffee lover like myself--not enough room for coffee!  It's definitely breakable, so treat it with care, but they're worth every last penny for it.  In fact, I think I might purchase more for my cat loving friends!"
"Very warm and comfortable. Good slippers but cause my feet to overheat on a warm day, so good for winter only."
"I bought this sandals a few months ago and absolutely love them, got lots of compliments but unfortunately I lost them, so I'm ordering another pair and thinking I might get the red ones later.  I recommend this product, TEVA sandals are great!"
"They are pretty, comfortable and I can walk for hours on end without have tired feet.  I am glad Jambu has finally made their sandals in wide widths.  Can't wait until they make more styles in wide widths!"
"excelente producto y el vendedor muy cumplido lo recomiendo ampliamente, a la hora de la entrega fue muy puntual saludos desde venezuela"
"Very well made. Very good material and durability.  Well worth the investment for my wife. She uses these doing everything a Mom with several kids need to do without having to change shoes when she cant. She says they are very comfortable as well. We have carpet and wood floors,  a gravel driveway, and conglomerate"
Looks/works as expected. Included tools were a nice extra and helped with installation. Fits this LG G Watch nicely.
"Really beautiful bracelet! Was pretty disappointed that it didn't come in a box though. Just a plastic bag. Really lack luster for such a pretty item. Giving as a gift so now I have to find a box for it. Other than that, I think my mom is really gonna love it!"
I love my Mary Jane. My size didn't fit but the larger size did fit and they are so classy and original. A must buy and great appeal.
Purchased as a prime day deal for my wife. They are good pieces and have held up well.
"I live in Wisconsin and work part-time outdoors so a well-made, properly fitting, warm boot is essential.  These are probably the best winter boots I have ever purchased and it's obvious that after one Wisconsin Winter I will be wearing these for several years to come - excellent quality."
Very nice beach shorts. True to color and size
"My son needed something to keep him warm but a light fit and this worked. He is above average in heigth 5 year old and the size 6 fit him perfect, I actually couldn't ordered a 7 and it may have worked better with the sleeves just at the mark where they could be too short but the 6 works."
"Bigger than I thought.  It is very functional with several zippers and slots, and compartments to store everything.  I love the quality, color and design.  The only things I do not like are the deep pockets that are impossible to find things- could have added a little padding as there is absolutely none.  The strap is very long which I adjusted but then there is another issue with grabbing it to go.  Overall for the affordable price the good out weighs the not so good.  It's overall a great leather purse."
it came in record time and it is very beautiful. princess loves it
"Well-made and super cute shoe, but the sizing is very off, order a full size up. I normally take a 6.5N and ended up in 7.5N. The toes are tight, these are not super comfy shoes, but a stylish and practical dress-shoe option if you're tied of heels. They actually look a lot like men's opera pumps for a bit of a menswear-chic look."
I thought it would be too small for my sister-in-law but it wasn't.  True to size
I had to have hip surgery and more these socks everyday and you would not believe the comments and compliments I got on these socks  the nurses would call me crazy socks and they love them .  I told them to purchase them on Amazon
Most comfortable sports bra I have owned! Plan to buy addition items. Easy to put on and wash.
this  was  a gift  and  my  boyfriends daughter loved it.  she  has  worn them with  sweaters and  t s***s  great product.
"Awesome headbands- in fact, the only ones that will keep my hair up."
Absolutely love these leggings! They are sooo soft! Wish I would have ordered 1 size smaller cause there a Lil too long but I always order big cause I would rather somthing be a Lil big than too small. My husband asked if I've been loosing weight when he saw me in these! I haven't! Must be the design on them is slimming! Humm.. Or mayb I just wasn't retaining as much water that day
Great bag. Deducted one star because of color. Most baggallini beach colors appear much lighter and subdued (both exterior and interior). Exterior is more brown and interior is hot pink. But it gets the job done.
"very cute & look nice'
easy to fit
nice for day & night
good looking
its fit ok very good finish"
Very comfortable shoe. True to size. Nice change from wearing a high heel shoe.
"The chain is better than expected, the crucifix is very stunning great for gif"
"Shirt arrived quickly. Fits good, nice shirt for the price."

love them! where em everywhere!
"I love these slippers! I found these a few years ago and now they are the only ones I want.  Great arch support!  They are very warm and feel so cushiony! I couldn't find any in the stores at the end of the season, so ordered 2 pairs so I could wear one while washing the other."
"Bought these for my honey for vday (very cute shoe for a mans man) .. they are just a touch big... big enough to maybe wear thick gym socks with.. I would suggest maybe a half size smaller than your actual shoe size, otherwise they will be flipping and flopping all over the place."
This is Good!
"Of course purple is my favor color, but i bought some long sleeved shirts to wear at work, because it's always chilly there."
"Great Fit, Roomy, and a great length."
They are a little stiffer than the previous ones like them but the fact they are washable is a plus and they have a little more support.
"Sexy, great price."
"Okay, found these on sale.... print too bold?! Maybe for some but decided I could pull off the purple, nevermore grapes just could be a conversation starter :) they are soooooo comfortable. I know Bogs can be pricey, but if you want a pair & don't mind the prints that no one else wants, it's well worth trying. Good intro to the brand as they were my first pair of Bogs as well....."
these are pretty great boxers they feel like someone is hugging your nethers all day. if you're into that...
I love these shoes and they have held up really well.  I can wear them all day and still be comfortable.  The only glitch is that you need to order a size smaller.  I usually wear a 9 and 8 fits great.
I like my jeans baggy for comfort. These fit just right.
"These are really pretty good boots for the price. I've ordered several pairs over the years. The inner sole isn't super cushiony but overall feels pretty good walking around in them. I wear them for mowing lawns, they hold up pretty good. Size is perfect...."
it's a good shoe for summer and comfortable . Size is okay for my friend and she like its color.
Light and nice flirty length.
bought them as Christmas gifts for my grand daughters.. They loved them.
"Exactly what I needed for NYE dress--wear with longer dresses. My dress was floor length. I also have a nightclub dress I wear this with, but be sure to pin the bottom hemline."
Comfy sneakers... I've been buying them for years.
I originally ordered a size 7 because reviews said to order a size down. Too small; returned them and got my regular size 8 and they fit perfect!
I continue to be satisfied with every pair of Propet shoes I have owned. These are no different. Excellent quality product!!
Very comfortable.  I like them a lot
I like the comfy feel to this.  Goes well with skinny jeans and boots.  Have washed many times and the color has barely faded.
"if you like a classic design, solid construction this is it.  I have had it for several months now and its definitely a winner.  Also, price is unbeatable."
Love the pattern and the feel of the leggings. I do not like the waist band however. It is small and really cuts into my stomach so after wearing them for an entire day
Truly beautiful and well made.  Comes with helpful hints on tarnishing as well!!  Super nice web site!!
Legit. Happy with my purchase.
"I'm 5'3"" and 110 lbs. It can adjust to fit people of other sizes. I got the purple dress. It is so beautifully made. Couldn't be happier with this purchase!"
Bought it for my daughter in law.  She loves it.
More like ankle socks. I got the 9-11 size. Ended up giving them to my grandma who's a size 7.5 they fit her perfetly
Small around my ankle but the sandal itself is beautiful..
"Love the fit, super comfy!! BUT... stretches out. Not to the point that i can't wear it all day, but i have to keep tugging it up eventually."
So cute and fit so well. Less expensive than the ones at parties.
Love these the fabric is so soft! Love having a zipper fly and the pockets are nice! Win Win size is just right I'm between a 38 / 40 waist with a 32 inseam and the XL fit perfectly and the drawstring waist in addition to the elastic waist band make waist size no problem...
I ordered this and really liked the way it looked and felt when it arrived.. I'm 5'1 120 with 34Ds.. Based on the advice of someone else I figured a medium would work for me.. Not even close lol I couldn't even get it over my butt.. I really did like it tho so I'm exchanging it for a L .. I hope it works!!
"Received my shoes before delivery date which was awesome. I'd been looking for a pair of cute, goes with anything, comfy booties with just a hint of heel that could be every day slip-ons and dressy. Needless to say I LOVE THESE SHOES! They're perfect and exactly what I wanted! The price was icing on the cake."
"This is my fourth pair of NYDJ jeans purchased at Amazon. The fit is great, the stretch makes them comfortable. I also like the 33 inch inseam as I am tall and long legged. NYDJ typically run up to $140 a pair. So getting them for $40 to $60 on Amazon, paired with Prime two day delivery is awesome."
"Thick, strong leather. Carhartt recommends buying one size larger than your pants. I'm 38"" so I bought 40"". It fits perfectly. I'll probably buy another one."
Nice material a little tight in the arms nice color well made
Love this sterling silver charm! Great detail and high quality piece. Bears the 925 stamp. Perfect size and have already received compliments on it. Great purchase.
"Love these socks. Super comfortable and soft, very breathable. I wear a size 12 shoe, these come up high enough on my ankle so that the backs of my running shoes don't rub. Had them for a month or so now and use them primarily when I work out."
"Excellent piece.

* Very elegant and sturdy design
* I love the fact that is not shinny, but a matte finish
* I like the color-line around it; It adds a very nice touch
* Cushions are also well made and soft, but do keep their shape

The only concern I must express is that while all cushions are armed with watches, there seems to be a enought room/space for the watches to tilt to sides.  But this could be one's personal preference as some may find it a plus when pullling one the watch to wear.

I certainly recommend it and would buy again both as gift and personal."
"Bought these as a gift.  Constant praise.  Still holding up after almost 2 years.  Bought 3 pieces.  Personally, I use Travel Pro but these are holding their own."
"Exactly as advertised, been using them for a few months and have had no problem. Keeps my hands warm while biking and still able to use my phone"
Very pleasant accessory.
My granddaughter loves her necklace.  Item as described.  No issues with packaging.
Love my aloha shirt
"Runs really small . My breasts barely fit in it
 . The shirt is silky / spandex and cut cute . It can be worn pulled down over the tummy or more scrunched up"
Works as intended
"Love this boots, very comfortable and keep you warm during those cold days of winter."
Awesome but gosh the boot is soooooooowide and super tall around the leg for a 7 year old.
Why not spend $20 for a reasonably priced wool-ish cap? The only think I didn't like was the surprise on the inside: the tag which boldly proclaimed: Made in China.
Very comfortable and my kid looks good in them.
I love this bag! It fits everything I need for work or for errands. The description said it was for men but as a woman I love the style and utility of it.
Excellent bras at an excellent price.
Very pretty dainty and elegant it looks great and i love the siple design
and she loves it  .
Amazingly low price for nice shirt.
They're cute and comfy. Great for watching morning games. :)
A gift and I was given the link so I am sure it is what he wanted....
"I bought a pair 2 years ago and wore them every day they lasted unreal, so I thought I would buy them again..very fast postage and half the price, thanks Amazon"
Sizing is too wide for slender feet
"typical Levis, good jeans, should last for a long time"
"The passport was just what I was looking for;  room for passport, money and more without being bulky.  Love the size and the quality.  Will definitely buy from this seller again."
So cute and we'll mde
I love watches. I have tons of them. This watch sets all other watches apart. One the way it is designed. The white flowers are beautifully crafted. I think the floral design gives this watch a very ladylike feel. Great to wear everyday with anything. The watch face is the perfect size. Not to big not to small. The clasp is easy to open and close. I really love this watch. I wear it very frequently.
"Its nice, does not give full coverage though, the cups are a bit heavier than I wanted. Also the cups are not that smooth. Had to go down a cup size."
Love the material and fit. Perfect for business casual.
"Love this!! Light & pretty!! Perfect for spring, summer, love the lace!!!"
Hubby loved this
"I'm taking a star away because this costume is SMALL! I knew to buy a bigger size from the reviews but honestly, buy 2 sizes bigger. My TWO MONTH old barely fits in it and he's 12.5 lbs and about 23 inches long. The arms run long and the rest of the costume super small. I'm considering returning and sizing up. Other than the size issue, it's a very cute costume and I'm sure he will be a hit this year."
Cotton..a gift..this sleep wear is wonderful.. Im buying one or two more
Love it ..super light for the day. Only downfall no SPF.
This a great replacement once you size it to your rist beats the rubber strap on the luminox watch
They fit great. Love them
"Comfortable and stylish. Feels like good quality, the strings loose at the bottom back are obnoxious but worth dealing with for ne. I'm a size 10/12, 5'10"" and a Large fits comfortably."
"This is the second one I have purchased, after about a year and a half the lining on the first separated from the shell. But it is a good size and I always get hard cases that can withstand being thrown in my purse etc."
"Wore to graduation, very nice for church or any event really."
"For the cool graduate in my life, some aviator shades!  These were perfect!"
"I am 5'4"", 110lbs. I ordered an x-small and it fit perfectly!"
AWSOME SHIRT ! HAD IT IN A DAY ! FITS PERFECTLY!!!!!!!!
No problems. Very warm. Looks nice.
These shoes are great these were my first pair I love them ! And i am a guy .. They did Fit me a bit big maybe like a finger space from my experience I would recommend just a .5 smaller that was the only down side there still holding .
Hot perfect for a fit body
"I was looking for camis to use under shirts for layering and modesty that never bunch and are comfy.  These are the Ambiance brand that I loved so much from 5-7-9!  They are super long (come down to the bottom of my pantyline), but that is exactly how I wanted them.  The dark colors are  98% opaque, the lighter colors are not--so beware if you plan to wear them alone.  Yay!  I have found my dream camis again!"
The quality of the dress is very good for the price. My little one just lit up when she saw it. She is very much into Belle and beauty and the beast. Whenever you would ask her what does she want to wear in the morning the answer now is a very enthusiastic Belle dress. The dress has led to many cute photos and many days of a happy little one.
You rock!!! Where can you find such great prices and combined shipment. I read all the reviews and made my selection and I am so very happy with my purchase. My tops fit exactly like they are suppose to and the colors are right on. You can not beat the price. Thank you so much for such a great purchase experience. I will be back for more and I will tell all my friends about your clothing.
"This Seiko automatic works just as well as my other one. A reliable and good looking watch, it's got a place in my collection next to other, far more expensive pieces. Great for work and play!"
I brought this for our daughter and she lives in them.  When she get in from work or school she actually runs to her room to put on these slippers.  She states that they are very comfortable and she just loves the way they feel on her feet.  She is already asking for another pair for the future in case they stop making them.  Money well spent!
I'm 5'6 and 130  lbs.  I ordered the Small and it fits.  Material seems sturdy yet stretchable.
Dansko shoes are the best that I have ever bought. Your formula for quality and comfort cannot be beat.  Thanks.
This is my daughters second pair; she left the other one on the MegaBus..smh
"Aerosoles are great. I have a narrow foot and shoe was tight across the front, will take some time to loosen up, need to alternate shoes until it wears in!"
"I work for a grocery store, so it means a lot of bending, up and down, puching, pulling  you name it and this beast of shoes has taken it all  even when the are supposed to be office designed.

In simple words the older they get ,the better.

Highly recommend."
"nice boots, good price!"
"Ordered this for my 13 yr old grandaughter. She LOVES it!! It has held up very well, too! She uses it daily, & the fabric & stitching are of good quality."
love the way they ride on my hips and the access for sex
They're good quality. My husband likes them. They fit his shoe size fine.
Couldn't believe the price - coat is very comfortable and warm - well pleased!
I had to exchange for a smaller size but the quality and comfort are definantely worth 5 stars. They are a fashionable comfort shoe.
Theses socks are horribly made with one wear there were holes in the toes not the quality expected at all does hanes sell a product usually marked imperfect unknowly and misleading to consumers shame on them.
So far it's great.
I like this bra it's comfortable and reasonably supportive.
Very comfortable  shoe.
"Made from  Good Materials  but I only have worn then and washed them twice.

Let's see how long they last after 10, 20 washings"
"These are like a thin tight, you can probably see your underwear when sitting.  But I am wearing under a short dress and it works out fine for me."
"The colors and patterns on these are both very fun and make the items easier to find in the baggage areas. I love the little note cards, as they are cute and make filling out my information very simple. They also have enough room for someone who writes a bit big. I get a lot of compliments on them. My only complaints are that one of them was quite brittle and it snapped when it was bent a bit. I have not found this to be true of the other ones, so I assume that this one may have just had a weak spot. Either way, I will simply glue it it back together as it is not a big deal. I also had the plastic for one of them come off, which caused the ink to get smudged a little bit. I do wish that the plastic pieces were connected to the items themselves, which would make them more durable."
"Excellent sneakers for trail running and hiking. Very light, comfy, and durable. Wore them for a week hiking in MT with a 70-80lb pack, and they performed great. They dry fast also - Im gunna but another pair soon to use when these wear out, which seemingly will take a long long time."
I wish it was a large it is some what too large only the bottom though
waist bands are fraying
Perfect fit and good value.
"This item was so well packaged it took a while to get to it. My first impression on handling this wallet was the slick plastic feel in my hand however; the carbon fiber outer layer looks nice and you get used to it quickly. Upon inspection you can easily see the detail the manufacturer took making this wallet. Stitching is perfect to my eye, leather is supple and there is plenty of room for necessary and the usual items you carry. While it is not shown in the picture you can use a top slot to put a wallet insert with your pictures and cards in it. Bottom line is it is as described and worth the cost."
Love 'em! I wear them around the house almost everyday after work.
Took a little longer to arrive but worth the wait.  Well made shorts that don't ride up my you-know-what!
"This is a great little summer bag! I walk with a guide dog so I have to carry backpack purses and I love this one!  The inside structure is not very sturdy, the price is great."
My style!
"Very nice, just like the picture and came with a free chain necklace. Very pleased! Shipping was fast."
"Adorable wedge. Super comfy. The clasp however is weird. Perhaps it's a Crocs thing. Instead of a traditional sandal strap, you feed the strap around a metal clasp. This in addition to the buckle already attached makes it a bit bulky.

Still totally worth it. Wish there were more colors to choose from."
"This product was really cute BUT the arms were REALLY tight, I had to cut them so I could get the top on without loosing circulation! It also had a hole in it. The skirt waist is stretchy which is good, my hubby loved it.

I am updating this review to reflect the attentiveness of the company. Although I was not happy with the product this company has been a pleasure to work with. I added a star because they contacted me right away and let me know they were willing to resolve the issue. I am satisfied with their solution and would definitely work with them again. Thanks again Amoretu! Its nice to know that there are companies that still care about customer satisfaction."
"I love this wallet, it's pretty large but I expected that. I have a ton of credit cards & identification cards I walk around with so this wallet is perfect for me. The wallet is well built and doesn't feel cheap at all, I highly recommend this wallet

Pros- large enough to hold all my cards, build quality, stylish design

Cons- might be to large for certain people so it's not for every one.

Shipping was fast & easy"
"I like this socks very much, they fit very good and look very nice. Very nice to wear them Thumbs up"
"I wear a size 5.5 and bought a size 6, since the shoes doesn't come in my size. I was hoping that 1/2 a size wouldn't really make a difference, but I was wrong! The shoes came and it was a nice shade of dark red. I loved the ankle strap and the shoes would've been perfect if it was just my size. I can usually pull off wearing size 6 sometimes, but it wasn't the case with these shoes unfortunately. So I had to return it with a heavy heart. I took a star off because the shoes did not come in size 5.5. Otherwise the shoes were really cute."
Adorable and comfy dress for Halloween.
"After returning 3 shoes I was getting fatigued. ALL of them were too small, too narrow, and/or totally uncomfortable. 13 is 13 guys.. Half of the size 13's I purchased felt like 11's!

So I ordered these, and was PLEASED. They fit remarkably well, don't crowd the feet, and are light - yet they feel well made. Also - they are flat out attractive looking, and I get compliments on them at work all of the time. I'm already 6'4"" tall, and these add a FULL INCH to my height which is awesome bonus! I was looking for shoes to make me 1-3 inches taller, and these also help in that regard. Who doesn't like a tall dude?

So in summary.. Well built. Increase height. The width of 'normal' feet. The sizes ARE the sizes - no lie.

I ordered a second pair to keep them on-hand.. Everytime I find something I like they stop carrying them, not this time! I have a couple of years of shoes ready to go. I am considering ordering 2-3 'spares' to store in the attic I love these so much!"
"Look great!  They do have a slight ""chemical"" smell that I'm still trying to get out (about 3 washes now) but its not so bad that I wouldn't buy them again, especially for the lighting deal price!"
"I really love this coat !  There is nothing to dislike about it,  The fit is right on!  It  is super warm and very stylish.  I am considering this coat as a gift for the next Christmas season."
"Love it. Going to aruba hard to find yellow shorts
 Exactly what i was looking for"
the color mix suits my taste. good support for walking. I like them and I wear them nearly every day.
The Best Edward Scissorhand Wig! You need this wig to make the outfit!
I have worn Carhartt for years because of the quality and this purchase is no exception.  5 stars all the way
"These are perfect house shoes. They offer great support, are easy on and off, and are ready for a quick trip to the mailbox or the grocery store."
Absolutely stunning! I love this dress. I am very curvy and I was afraid my hips would make the dress too puffy. Not at all the case. It was just perfect. It was a little longer than I expected but looks great with heels.
"I really like these boots, I have only wore them once but they were comfortable.  I had noticed that some people had commented that Frye boots may run small for size, this was an initial concern for me.  I normally wear  size 9 1/2, and the boots I ordered were not available in a size 10, so I ordered the 9 1/2 with a little trepidation...no worries, they fit great!  I am really happy with the look of these boots and the color as well, a great purchase!"
It tends to pinch a little in my skin. I am trying to figure out how to keep it from sliding up. I am constantly pulling it down a little. But overall good.
The fit ran small. I did like the beautiful color!  I  got a compliment from a young lady .
The colors are great and they are easily adjustable.
Super cute and snuggly
"My life in dressed did not begin until I met these bands. Seriously, every woman needs one of these in her lingerie drawer. I wear them at work and brag about my lack of a chub rub. Life is complete."
"I love this gemstone, have received many compliments on it. Maggie"
"As recommended by my orthopedic surgeon, I only wear New Balance.  I have been wearing them for about 10 years now & never have a problem walking all day wearing them.  These are just a fun color for an important cause.  I love wearing them.  New Balance is just the best show for me."
"Wear it all the time. I wish I got the darker color though, brown or black. They are really warm and compy. I got size 7 but I wear 6.5, I wear just the nylon because thicker socks will be too tight but with my nylon it is still warm."
"These are great shoes. I used them at the lake and they held up very well. We were on a rocky area, so these kept me from slipping and cutting up my feet. I haven't worn them at the pool so I'm not sure if they're slip resistant on tile, like some of these reviews warn against, but as for the outdoors, they're great. They're comfortable, soft, and cute, too!"
These shoes fit great  and they are beyond  adorable.  Im so pleased!
"The slides feel great. As far as fit, they do run a tad small but for me, at least, only a tad. Most of my shoes are 9s, with a few 8 1/2 and one 9 1/2. I ordered a 10 in these slides and they fit fine but some people might think they're slightly big. I like the extra room, though, and think a 9 would've felt small. So I guess the size depends on the type of fit you prefer."
"This outfit is so cute. I especially like the collar. Not much growing room for my grandson who is 7 months old, 20 lbs, and 30 inches long. I should have bought 18 months size."
This is a little gift for my granddaughter who loves high heel shoes.  It's perfect for her.  Comes in a pretty little gift box.
The fit is very good for me as they have the hidden expansion waist line that expands and contracts right along with me...  ;-)  I would recommend them as decent dress pants as long as you aren't expecting suit material...
Wash well and fit nicely
"I am always skeptical when ordering reader type glasses...usually too small for my face, not clear or curved too much but, these are (for me) perfect.  Yes...they are on the darker side but...They're ""Sun Glasses"".  In any case...I find them well made for the price, very clear with great visibility, large enough for my big mug, and I bought another pair for my Motorcycle.  For the price...I recommend."
I'm a size 6 but got a size 8 as I didn't want too many curves to show for the occasion. It's a little lose fitting all the way through so maybe size 6 would be more bodycon. The dress is well made and is lined.  I like the exposed good zipper at the back. I took away one star because there is no split at the back and and he length of the dress right and the knee makes it ride up and bunch when walking. I would've preferred a split to give some space so the dress sits in place while walking.
"They're so great, there's no need to break them in! I love them."
Very nice & comfortable I love the sparkle that they give.
Would have give 5 stars but hard to unhook.
"I just got this bra the other day and let me tell you , I'm so happy with this bra, its beautiful, fits really well, gives my 32dd's a great push up and im so happy that i got this and spent the money, i have the cheetah print one and i couldn't be happier with the design it is a great bra, better than i ever expected. Exceeded my expectations. i will be buying more"
"I bought these for my friend who is 5'9"", with a body type similar to the girl in the picture. These pants fit her PERFECTLY. I could not believe how good they looked on her. 100 stars!!!!!"
poorly made.  poked my finger and turned it green within hours.  oh well it was cheap
This is my second pair of the same exact shoes. It tells you how much I like the shoes because I wouldn't have bought them again if I didn't love them.
Been wearing Levi's most of my 61 years and I still love the way they fit and get more comfortable with every time I put them on.
washes up real well comfortable even though a bit snug on the top
I order four rings one day.  This is my favorite of the four.  The setting is just beautiful and I'm glad I got it for my pointing finger so the setting shows well on the side.  I would have gotten this one for my ring finger but was afraid it might to a little too wide for my taste.  It would have been fine.  This is a great buy.
Where gifts that everyone where happy with and fair priced. Decent quality. Long chain.
Lasting awhile.
These shoes my child as I expected they would. Glad they have wide sizes.  Nice shoe for the money.  I would recommend this product to others.
Keep buying more!
Perfect for sleeping and lounging around the house
"Such a pretty ring.  Fits perfect, the size is exact!  I love it."
Great top to wear in the hot summer months.  The material is cool to the touch and feels wonderful on.
"I love these loafers. They are very comfortable with good cushioning and support. They look great with a tailored pant, jean or jegging. Very chic. My first time ordering this brand - won't be my last!"
"Great material!!! Made excellent, I can tuck my top!!!
I will be ordering more colours!!!"
"My husband loves this shirt, it it made very well and feels super soft."
fits perfectly and is comfortable.
"Bought these for my mom as a Christmas gift, but of course I had to try them on before I gave them to her. They were really warm and comfortable, I kind of wish I would have kept them for myself. She really loves them too and she wears them all the time."
"These shoes are so comfy, sexy and cute, they were a little over my budget but so glad I made the purchase...Love them!"
Holds everything properly and my favourite colour is blue so I totally love this bra. The material isn't as soft as it could be but it's not a deal breaker.
"I have not bought a pair of Smartwool running socks that I have not loved, and these are no exception.  I have gotten used to running in them in the hot weather, too, because they fit perfectly, they breathe, they never slide off your foot, and they feel great.  these running socks are excellent!"
"I got these for my husband at Christmas, 2013.  He still wears them today.  They fit well and the inside padding is still soft.  They're not as plush inside as they were, but he wears these literally every single day for a minimum of 4-5 hours and he says they're still very comfortable.

Great shoes...hold up well."
Great sandals for my son - very comfortable.  The adjustable straps are great - I bought them big enough so he may actually be able to get two seasons of wear.  He particularly likes the cushion in the sole.
"Good price, good fit and they were shipped timely which is appreciated"
"Exactly as pictured, comfortable and pretty. Thank you"
"These rings are amazing. They fit so well and have clear bright colors. If i don't want to wear them as rings i put them on a chain, looks amazing as a necklace too!!"
"Normally a 7 1/2 but ordered 8. They fit pretty good with a little room left over. I wore them for the first time for around 8-10 hrs and I have no complaints, they were comfortable enough to wear all night walking and dancing.

If I ordered my normal 7 1/2 they would probably be a bit too snug if I wore thick socks so I'm glad I went half size up.

Pretty good material and quality, I've worn them a lot and there's been no issues.

The zipper on the front does work and zips all the way down. There's also a zipper on the sides."
I'm going to buy them in all colors.  They are more comfortable than my slippers!
This bra is very comfortable and great fitting.  I am very satisfied with my purchase.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a comfortable everyday bra.
"The Mens Brief Basic Print Underware Casual Cotton is perfect fit. Colors are bright and wash well. The stitching is perfect, does not ride up when wearing. Love this product. Product was received for a discount for my honest review."
"These are truly amazing jeans!  The fit is awesome and the length is perfect.  The are a bit tight right now, because I sized down based on my other 7 jeans so they SHOULD loosen up juusst a tad.  I didn't want them to get the 28 and they get too loose..I made that mistake before.  The color is great! Love them!! Worth the price!"
This jacket has been great this year because of how windy it's been where we live.  It's a wind breaker and fleece in one.  Very warm!
"SO comfortable. In fact, I loved them so much I had to buy my husband a pair."
a tiny bit small so returned to go up a size.  But love the pattern and fit.... the suit is still sexy provides the flexibility to be a mom to my kids and not have to worry about all of my parts staying put!
"So far they have held up, my feet have stayed dry in the rain, pretty warm but not as warm and comfy as my uggs. I added a memory foam insert from fleet feet which has helped but still not super comfy but then again im comparing them to my uggs, they are very cute and i have got lots of compliments in them. I think great buy for the price."
It fits my 4 month old and don't know how long more he will fit it. Over all it is cute
The shirt is the exact color! I love the thumb holes & it's warm!
Love these shoes!  Exactly as pictured!
Too funny. Fits fine. I love it!
"These gloves are actually pretty neat. Definitely made for children so the materials aren't the best in the world, but they've definitely held up for the few weeks that my 3 year old has had them and he's fairly rough on things. The seams are all still intact, no fraying that I can see anywhere. For a young Batman fan, these are wonderful. I would definitely buy them again."
"Keeps water out, what else is needed?"
I'm getting more colors! It's a perfect piece to have in your closet!
"Nice slim profile, quite well made and very simple setting functions anyone can figure out. Very similar to 1970's LED watches in functionality. The strap is nice but is very proprietary to the watch. The leather is straight cut and inserted into a fastening slot which has two fine tip screws underneath on either end which hold the strap secure, To replace, it could be done if you find a 28mm strap and cut the watch pin slot portion off with a razor and straight edge. KC does sell replacement straps for $25&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kenneth-Cole-Genuine-Smooth-Leather/dp/B00CPTJCK8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kenneth Cole Genuine Smooth Leather</a>
 Looks like it will last a long time though with casual wear. I like it more for its looks and comfortable design but seems to be durable as well. Stainless case, mineral glass which is flush with case so it is susceptible to damaging without care upon smacking it on any hard surfaces.
 Overall a very nice easy reader which sits well in case size, profile and comfort being light weight.
It is a dark display which I see some complaints upon but, it is the design factor in play here. That feature gives the watch its stealthy look. personally, I think its great and not at all hard to read. I'm 51 and wear glasses for anything within two foot of my nose. If the strap was a standard pin fastening design, I would give it 5 stars."
"Love Levi's jeans and the 550 fits me the best. The pants I bought are black with a black leather label with silver letters. The small Levi's tag is red. Not faded, not washed, the jeans have a new look but are not stiff. The thing that pleases me the most is buying them from Amazon. I take a popular size and when I go to the department store my size is more often than not ""sold out"". How nice it is to not only have my size but also a choice of colors!"
Cute Easter socks
Its exactly what I was looking for
"Got here sooner than expected
It's just adorable"
"This was so cute! We did a plaid themed Thanksgiving, and this was perfect with a pair of black leggings."
Fantastic T-shirt. I'm gonna buy more from this seller.
"This is my 3rd pair of the ""go-walk"" shoes, but my first pair of the Go Walk 2.  I wear 9-1/2 and the fit is perfect.  Wore them all day the first day I received them & they were perfect.  Everyone should own at least one pair."
"EXACTLY what I was looking for!!  Can't go wrong on this one! I was a little worried about it fitting my sons VERY big head but, it fits great...maybe a little snug but still very acceptable. I ordered 6 all together...to fit a variety of sized heads.  Good news is that they fit EVERYONE I bought them for!  :D"
Nice quality and quick delivery.
"Arrived exactly as advertised!
The best quality silicone tunnels I've owned.
Worth the purchase."
"I bought these underwear because I have always been a Hanes type of women. Never really liked wearing the cute and frilly underwear types. I prefer comfort over anything else. I've been purchasing Hanes underwear for many years now and I don't think I will ever switch. I've bought different styles from boy shorts to bikinis and I really prefer these hipster style ones. They just fit my body the best and this amazon price is a bit lower than in store prices. I ordered to pack's and they both came in cute colors and prints. I got a purple-ish brown, a white with tiny pink and purple dots all over it and lastly a light pink. I often wear cloth pads and I do find that these hipster panty's are a bit wide in the gusset region for me for click my cloth pads in place but it's not horribly uncomfortable, I just need to buy more of these in bikini style I suppose. Whenever I reach in my panty drawer for a clean pair I always prefer these, I just am thrilled with this purchase. I definitely recommend these."
"Fits suunto core perfectly, seems to be good quality. I found it difficult to install, it was a 2 person job!"
Great price and offered a variety of products for the new Apple 6
Cute jeans that fit my daughter nicely. She can be hard to find jeans for at times. I will buy Levi's again for her.
"Fits well, does not ride up"
Beautiful and affordable. The item met my expectations. The rubber straps gives it a youthful look while the face of the watch gives a mature look. I recommend it for ladies with a youthful sense of fashion.
its really comfortable but slightly on the small side.
"I've been looking for something like this since I lost my original septum retainer years ago. This product exceeded my expectations! Perfect size, length and looks just like the original! Would absolutely buy again :)"
"My daughter loves these. They are extremely lightweight, making running quite easy for her."
"These are the comfiest boots I've ever owner, and they stay dry, even in all of Florida's puddles!"
Cute tee. Great for a big bang theory fan.
This was a gift for someone who was going through a rough abusive relationship.  I purchased this to protect her.  It is well made and just beautiful looking and meaningful.
This is a great light-weight tote for carrying groceries or small items. It folds easily to have handy in a purse or in the car for unexpected shopping trips. The painting is adorable & it's supporting a great cause. I love this tote.
"nice loafers. very comfortable. just wish they were real leather, but for the cost, you could buy a new pair every year."
"I was hoping for more sequins to cover the shirt, but I suppose the style is meant to be as is. My daughters underarm got mildly scratched up or irritated a bit from rubbing up against the sequins underneath her arms after wearing it for one evening. We bought it more as a costume piece, but I imagine it is designed more for performance? Overall seems to be a sturdy design and of decent quality."
I really like this.  I used it when I was prepping my yard for new grass. Kept me from breathing in the dead/dry grass. The ear holes are a nice feature. They keep it from working its way down your face.
Very warm and thick sweater!!!  It's matches the women's except it doesn't have a back print.  It looks exactly like the photos.
Love them! Great Buy.
"Great canvas sneaker to stand in all day long. Comfy, breathable, and colorful. The tag on the back sometimes nips at the rear of my ankles, so you can't wear super short socks with them. I"
"Great comfort, support and fit!"
I have worn 608s since they first came out; normally in women's. Women's had no navy so I've ordered these and sure they'll be as wonderful as all the others have been. I will return them if not and Amazon is the best when returns are a must.  Very serious ankle problems due to medication for transplant and my orthopedic surgeon recommended New Balance so here I am and here I'll stay after 12 surgeries.  Couldn't ever ask for better fitting nor more comfortable shoes.  I love them. They are ALL I wear so I have every color!
"This skirt is super soft and comfy. It is very flattering and lays nice and smooth. I ordered a large and it fits me great, just like the size chart said."
"Great size. Large enough to be noticeable, but not enough to be gaudy. Looks much more expensive than they are."
Exceptional quality and a good fit.
I use this little clip a lot to hold sweaters close or on the back of shirts and suit jackets to give them a more fitted/tailored look...
I purchased these socks for a friend who loves Hippos.  She was delighted to receive them and she reports that they fit just fine.
Perfect fit and colors were as expected.
"This bra fits well, and is comfortable for all day wear. I do find that the cups don't stay down when unclipped as easily as I would like, and I assume that is due to the light padding. I do, however, like the padding. It's not so much that my breasts look bigger (I'm a 34f so that is a big plus) but it is just enough to provide a bit of modesty coverage. It's also great for hiding small leaks so you can catch them before they soak through your shirt!"
I am a bigger girl with a large bust I was concerned about not having support in my boobs. It makes me look AMAZING. DEFINITELY recomend
"I have not been able to use these yet, but they are a great quality product.  I like that the company emailed me to make sure that I received my product and that they want to make sure that I am satisfied with their product.  I plan on buying a couple of more sets of these packing cubes!"
"I have problems with the bindings on socks squeezing my legs so I have been looking for non-binding socks.  These came up in a search on amazon so I bought them.  They are VERY soft, and non-binding!!  They can get a little loose later in the day but no problems for me.  They are warm for winter and wash and dry well with no shrinking.  Very comfortable and very pretty."
Love these! Super comfortable. Fit well. Good buy.
Gets the job done.
"I live and work in north Japan were we have had over 15 feet of snow this winter.  The temps average about 20 degrees during the day and about 10 degrees at night.  I work outside 50% of the time, and the other 50% inside.  I was issued boots when I got here and they were the worst boots I had ever had.  I ordered the Sorel Conquest Boots and was very happy with the design and craftsmanship.  The boots keep me dry and warm, almost too warm.  The boots will make your feet perspire therefor your feet get wet and that leads to another issue.  Overall I was pleased with the purchase."
I am very happy with this chain.  The chain seems to be very well made and the links are much less likely to kink (& eventually break) than previous designs I've tried.  This one doesn't snag and is very comfortable to wear.
"Really pretty and ""nubby"" - earrings have a nice weight to them."
My college athlete loved them!  Says she is the envy of all her teammates in the gym.
Compliments are always nice to receive ..
Fit is great...comfortable... Though long wear does yield a little chaffging from tight outer cloths...be aware but not too bad. Worth the small amount of discomfort.
Buy right size or it will not be attractive but the hose themselves were nice not cheap
Really nice studs - they shine and really reflect the light.  Great for those of us who have problems with nickel or other base metals.
"Fit perfectly, very comfortable. Haven't been out walking yet (32 ) so will have to update later!"
"I like this nightie a lot but I had an issue with the fabric at front of the yoke. The way they gathered the fabric there made it very bulky and they left a lot of the fabric there all bulky so I took it upon myself to trim some of the bulk and I just had to put a few stitches there where I made a mistake and was a bit overzealous with my approach but it turned out great and I happen to like that nightie out of the many I do have. So if you also find that the fabric right there  between your greats is too bulky you can trim it just be very careful and don't go overboard but if you ca sew a few stitches then by all means go Florida it because it felt perfect free that.its the ""price""lol you pay for buying online. I'd rather do that as I not someone that likes to shop I feel it's a waste of my valuable time."
Very good support with great comfort. I did add arch support foot petals because I have very high arches and suffer from plantar fasciitis but with these shoes I can walk in comfort. So happy with them I bought an pair.
"I had high hopes this shoe would help my poor aching arthritic feet.  It does.  Lots of support for arch and helping my plantar faciatis as well.  The color is bright and cheerful, like it a lot."
Wonderful product my husband loves it!! Will def buy buy again.
"They are not as cute as others, like the Ash Croco colored one or the blue and red croco ones in the same style; however, if you need a white pair, for the price, they are very comfortable and you can get away with the looks."
Love this item all I can say is try it for your self
i really like the shoe.
Like these pants but won't buy anymore until they are majorly discounted again.
LOVE LOVE LOVE. Arrived early & they're amazing. The middle is flexible so you're able to fit them to your face. Will totally be buying more.
I love my cubes and take them everywhere I go when traveling
Wear this a lot! Love it!
"I am so pleased with this bag. It is just as pictured....it is large but not cumbersome....I carry alot of stuff so this is just the bag for someone like me. I have received numeous compliments. The compartments on the inside are nice sized and the mini-bag that comes with it is an extra bonus...I used that for my makeup and extra change. Overall, I am very pleased!"
So beautiful!!!!! Love it !!!
"Fits well, a little thin, but great for mild winter / fall days"
"Love this, fits beautifully"
"Fits as expected, but only bc I knew what to expect. I wear a 9 to 9.5 in most shoes, but an 8 in this flip flop. I wear a 9 in another Vionic flip flop style."
Nice! Friends love colors.
"I have to buy mens wide sneakers, b/c of my bad foot. The sneaker is very comfortable & wide enough not to irritate my bad foot."
This is the third Invicta watch I have purchased.  It is exactly what I expected.  I love this watch.  Highly recommend it.
A little tight at the heel but overall not bad.
"The zipper works great, not big or bulky at all. The plaid print is just as shown and a cool detail."
"Beautiful boots. Unique look and height. Comfortable but a little roomy. According to other reviews, I was expecting them to be a little on the small side. I wear and 8.5-9 and went with the 9. I might have felt a little pinch with the smaller size, so happy to have wiggle room for my toesies. I have generally narrow feet but wimpy, sensitive baby toes that don't like touching my shoes. The heel is comfortable, and I can imagine the boots will stand up to a day's worth of teaching. Will update if things don't go as expected!"
"GREAT! Super quality socks in neon colors. Cant get them, so good looking they stop traffic love them, other colors please!"
When I took them all out I didn't think a lot of them were gonna fit some of them look to small some of them look too big but I tried all of them on and they all fit perfect
Very nice! Designs are great
"It's cute and fits well.  It's nice to find a shirt with a slim cut.  I'm tired of shirts being so baggy in the tummy.  And it was a longer length, so that's great too!"
I love this tie!  It looks as advertised.  I love the fact that it has paisley and stripes.  It goes good with anything!
Pretty dress & thick material so it's not see through. Love it.
"These plugs fit perfectly in the size I ordered (5/8) and I love them. They are a rich, beautiful color green and I highly recommend them to plug-wearers!"
These shoes are super comfortable and look great. I have been very pleased with these. They fit exactly as expected. I have been very happy with these.
Excellent quality. Look forward to many years of use out of this wallet.
"At EDC everyone seemed to have them but everyone still complimented mine!

Keep in mind they attach to a battery pack and wire that needs to be placed somewhere.  I had mine in my pocket but not every outfit has pockets."
If you're looking for an underwire free comfortable bra with decent support this is it I am triple D
"I love it, so classy and has lots of room inside.[...]"
"Great quality. Trooper loves it. He can go to work with it and leave his bucket at home and still represent the empire. Doesn't protect as well as the armor does, but I am still confident my Trooper will safely come home to me at the end of the day. Keeps him on task, even when his boss purposely tells him to be a bad shot. Good for morale."
pretty cool socks.
Flattering and cute.
"Love these heels.  First of all they're beautiful, the red color is a dark cherry, not bright.  But, they are also very comforable.  The heel is a high heel, yet I could walk in them all day long."
"great shirt, fit is perfect"
"I think this shirt is perfect. I have a business casual job, so I'm able to wear it with slacks or jeans. I'm 5'1'' and 130lbs and I bought a small. I think it looks a bit more shapely on me than in the pictures.

One of my favorites. Highly recommended. The material is thin, like all of Allegra K's shirts, but a simple tank underneath is an easy fix."
"Fit as expected. Never rode up, when I was running or riding my bike."
"My son loves them!  They are very warm and comfortable, but feel a bit big on him.  However, he wasn't waiting for a return/exchange so he's keeping them!"
Fits well.  My wife loves it because it is not too heavy and the belt is permanently attached
Very cute a little smaller than I thought it would be. But happy with it.
"I love these! They arrived way ahead of time, look beautiful, and are just as described. Some reviews say they aren't actually sterling but I certainly can't tell (at least not after one week). At any rate, they're certainly worth what little they cost. I would, and already have, order from this seller again."
I really like this shoe for my daughter.  It was perfect for her.  The only thing is I had a difficult time getting her sized correctly.  This shoe runs differently.  She was just measured for size 6. But in this shoe she actually could fit size 4.
Material soft and iron on looks great.
"Just like my 8 other kipling bags, very roomy, great quality, vibrant color very light weight even with my everyday stuff in it. Love it!"
"My wife loved it.
I think its a good buy considering the price. It looks stylish..
No foul smell in the bag."
"This shirt is made of a normal T-shirt material. Loose fitting yet maintains a flattering shape. Perfect for a work out of just a low key summer top. I anm 5' 7"" and 125 lbs. Ordered a small and it was a perfect fit."
"So I've only just started wearing them, but there is no strong odor that you wouldn't associate with new shoes.  They look very nice, but for the price I don't expect them to last forever.  I'll update as I wear them more, but I am very happy with the purchase."
Very comfortable and slightly more feminine looking sandal from Keen.  Love!
"Bought this for my 5'5"" mother in law. She loves it and she is hard to please"
Love the comfort and quality for the price of this product! Will definitely order more of this brand of flip flops..
I bought this and the Mother of the Groom handkerchief for my daughter's wedding.  The writing is in white and difficult to read but it certainly served it's purpose on my daughter and son-in-law's wedding day!  If I had purchased them earlier I would have embroidered over the white in blue...which was the color of the wedding.
Great shoes. Would not use them for running or working out.  But I wear them to work all day and they are great. I get lots of complicments.  Would definitely buy more colors.
Love these shoes! Bought a second pair for back up!
Carhartt stuff rocks and this shirt lived up to that.  Looking to get another one of these shirts in another color.
"Even though the size is 1/2 smaller than my size but they are comfortable, I  like them."
Was exactly as it said it would be and has plenty of room.
"In the past, I've used disposable pocket knives for spring-pin removal.  They are too large to work well, dull the blades quickly, and sometimes require enough force to risk cutting yourself badly if the blade slips or the spring-pin comes out unexpectedly.  This tool works better because not only is the tip small enough to reach into the tiny gap in metal bands, but also the slight bend of the tip allows one to apply significant leverage on the pin without the risk of stabbing yourself.  The replacement blades are a nice addition.  But for the price of this, buy two!  They're well worth the money."
"These fit so well and were so comfy I bought them in ""Grill"". This ""Gravel"" color leans toward green, whereas the Grill color leans toward grey. They are crazy water-repellent! I tried to rinse them in the sink....ha! That was a funny moment. They are super lightweight, stretchy (not baggy), and look great the whole time I'm wearing them. The pockets are mesh so there's not build up of excess heat and if dumped in the water they drain right out and you don't have a soggy lap area."
"I think the most surprising thing about these shoes was the quality of the leather for such a cheap price!  I'd expect to pay much more for them.  They're buttery soft and just gorgeous and really comfortable for a simple sandal.  I'd definitely buy Naya brand shoes again -- in fact, I think I'd seek them out.  Great quality at a good price, and the color is beautiful!"
"Great maternity tank, good for laying around the house but also nice enough to wear out."
"These are the best pair of boots I have ever owned. Water resistant, my feet feel toasty even after being in the snow for hours . Definitely worth the money !!"
Beautiful tie and good quality!  I get many compliments on this tie.
"When I saw this stunning ring it was a Must Have moment. It completely had my moms name written all over it. Which was exciting for me cause she has everything, but she didn't have this. Thrilled with my purchase price a value savings. My excitment got the best of me, she now has her Mothers Day gift 3m early. She loves it just as much as I do."
"love it, I really don't know what it says on the side, but I am a huge Naruto fan I bought my normal size in mens, so for the ladies out there this might be a little baggy, but it still looks great"
"I bought this corset for my Halloween costume. I have owned several corsets so I knew it was important to take my measurements. I am a 14-16 and I ordered a 5x. I can lace it completely so there is no gap between the back panels. I probably could have ordered a size smaller but since I'm not interested in cinching it tightly to shrink my waist the 5x fit very well. Now I would mention that this is a very light weight corset that has ribbons instead of laces. It's not what you want for true waist training. But for a costume, outer wear or just to dress up for you partner it's a good buy for the price. I was pleased with my purchase and it shipped fast. I also purchased the ""Steampunk Victorian Gothic Skirt"" from Pirate Dressing and the ""Yomoko Sexy Deep V-Neck"" to wear under it."
WHITE.- Great fabric.... irresible.
So pretty! I wear with leggings and boots....Very cute! Size is accurate.
"If you know your size in Lucky Brand jeans, you are in business!
you can order multiple styles and they will fit!
The dark color is great - paired them with pumps and a boucle jacket... Dressed up but could also be dressed down.
Enough stretch to be comfortable but not too much to have a sagging behind by the end of the day."
"My wife is very pleased with these beautiful, comfortable slippers. Attractive slip-ons are hard to find in this price range: these embarrassingly named Deer Stags Slipperooz represent excellent value for money--most highly recommended!"
I had previously purchased two pairs of these pants and was very pleased with them. Amazon is my first choice when I need something because elf their price and quality as well as service
"Okay so recently my husband was asked to be in his best friends wedding. He asked him that he need to get a green tie, any color green . So we have been going to everywhere to find the right color tie and he has been able to find one. So I was so freakin lucky that I was able to have found this tie on AMZ Review Trader and I had to snag it, so I ordered it and I'm so happy that I got it in a couple of days. The material is even better than what the pictures show here. This product picture doesn't give this time and pocket square any justice. He tried it on and it fits him perfectly and it looks so good on my husband, the color is so beautiful and I know he will rock this wedding. The pocket square is even beautiful. The material is not cheap, it's very strong and very well made. I will definitely be buying the other color for him so he can have a variety of ties, just in case he needs to wear a suit again. I know I will be getting my dad this time set as well. I know he will probably wear this time again for his annual company Christmas party. I highly recommend this time set. It's very elegant and a beautiful tie set. I know any man/woman will look great in this time. Plus who doesn't like a well made experience looking tie and pocket square.
Disclosure: I received this product at a discount price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
"Bought it as a gift for my girlfriend, she said it fit a little small but it's very stretchy and ended up being just fine."
A bit smaller than anticipated but a nice purse
love them just got my earrings today worth the money packed well will order again soon.
Comfortable and elegant shoes.  I am always pleased with my Naturalizer purchases
Very strong stuff. Wear gloves
"I got the Light blue bag and it is beautiful the color is what it is in the picture. The bag is big enough that I can carry my laptop a binder and other things. And the handles are a decent size.  The best part is, it's easy to clean with soap and water."
We were so grateful to find the little tuxes for sale at Amazon.com.  The price was so reasonable and the suits were perfect for the ringbearers in the wedding.  The order was very timely as well.  Thank you!
"These PJs are great, my son loves them!  Very good quality and they do not stretch out after one wearing.  I'd buy this brand again."
"My grandson has extremely wide feet, they're like little school buses lol. The only brand of shoes that fit him is Stride Rite and they are a miracle! The first day these arrived he wore them to go fishing in and decided to jump in the water..they wash and dry beautifully, exactly what an active 4 year old needs. Finding them on Amazon at such a great price makes me happier than I can explain, thank you Stride Rite and thank you Amazon!!!"
bought as a gift for my brother and he still wears it to this day.  it's holding up good.
Nice pump.  The fit and comfort is great for my wide foot and narrow heel.
Totally cute bag. However it is a little small to carry too many things.
"Just a lovely ring in every way.  First, the pearls (freshwater) are real ... and I really prefer decent freshwater pearls to any but the best of saltwater pearls anyway (akoya, south sea, Tahitian ... doesn't matter).  These are round and appear to be good quality.  The setting is appropriate for an adult.  In fact, it is a rather largish bypass.  You won't be able to wear this ring with another on the same finger.  If you are particularly tiny-handed, it might well extend over the adjacent joints.

In other words, it has enough size to establish a presence, and would be well-coupled with a pearl bracelet for a classic dress look.  That the setting is platinum-plated is a really strong plus for those who can't tolerate silver (e.g., those with acidic skin) - and it's hard to find in costume jewelry.  The stones (c. zirconia) add sparkle and movement.  While cubic zirconia can sometimes look a little over-bright, say in a yellow gold setting, they are an excellent choice for a pearl ring in a white setting.

Sizing is true.  Fit and finish is excellent, as is the price.  This ring is a really good buy."
I love these flip flops. This is the second pair I've ordered from Amazon.
great product.  So comfortable.
"It's been through the wash about 6 times now and still good, can't say better than that."
This is SO SEXY! I'm So glad I purchased it! The price is amazing for the quality of the product. Why can't more Sellers do the same? They know darn well that their products are NOT worth the 800%-2000% markup...Thanks Camellias Corsets!
"Perfect whitish-silver wig. Bangs are quite long, but I think fanning them back will work fine."
nice quality. Varied patterns for boys.
"I bought this dress in pink color and its just awesome, very pretty and classy with lovely crochet. I got so many compliments, when I wore this dress. The fit is also perfect. Overall awesome buy!!!"
"Big, but my son loves it anyway.  It is good for a sleepover.  A college student could carry a laptop.  There are no pockets inside."
"Love, love, love these shoes...the colors are awesome and the look is great.  They are super comfortable and fit great.  I wear an eight, bought an eight and perfect!!  They are a little wide but that is exactly what I need cause I have a bit of a wide foot...
Again....LOVE THESE SHOES!"
"Actual socks differ somewhat from the socks pictured, but still really cool. The actual socks have fewer skulls placed further apart, but like I said, still really cool."
Purchased these for a dance show. They needed to be steamed into shape with a steamer but they look great.
"The only sneakers we buy for our wide footed toddler, they seem perfect."
"I really wanted to love these but they felt a little baggy in the seat on me (which is not an area things normally feel saggy on me).  They are still cute but not quite as ""young"" looking as I had hoped."
I was always stopped and asked where I got these. So different but really cute. Awkward until you got use to the wear. But easily broken in. A fun buy!
worked exactly as needed
"These are great. I'm 6'7"" and ordered a 36. They are long enough and the waist is good. They sit right on my kneecap. I measured them at 23"" in total height. Just what I needed. Tall guys buy these!"
True to size and super cute.
My husband says its like wearing slippers!
"The sizing is ridiculous, a size large comes out like a 2xl. I try to shrink my 10 shirts as best as possible but they are still huge. They take daily mechanic abuse though."
"This is a well made garment.  The fabric is a nice weight, not flimsy.  It's a ""one-size fits all"" and I am size 4-6 and it clings very snuggily (if that's a word) to my body.  The only thing that I don't like is how it slowly starts to hike up throughout the day, so I need to keep pulling it down."
"Sterling Silver is the best metal to wear for regular everyday use. It also has a professional touch to it. Black Onyx or Simulated Black Onyx is a stone used for both style and auspicious way of living. Bought this a few days ago and have been wearing it since. Typically,a ring is on or off depending upon how the skin reacts to the warm/cold/hot water shower. No rash.,the ring is good..."
Shipping was a disaster. I like the idea behind the company I ordered from as I like to support our service men. That being said I received 2 diff emails with diff ship dates and it took over 2 wks to get the product. I was disappointed as I ordered in what should have been enough time before Christmas but didn't get it until after the new year. I placed orders after this and had all my other products in time for the holiday. The shirt is nice.
"Long and very thin necklace, this is great for those charms that you want to hang close to your cleavage."
"I love this jacket. Fits perfectly. I'm not normally a formal jacket wearer, but I needed one and saw this and thought I would try it. I ordered a 2x and it fit as expected. I am a size 16, but usually order 18/20 up top because I have broad shoulders. If I would have ordered a smaller size, I might have been able to wear it, but probably would not have been as comfortable. My pic is not the greatest  because of the lighting, but hopefully it helps. The quality of the jackets  is pretty good. It is a knit jacket and it stretches. For the price, it was great."
Shield goes well with Captain America costume I ordered for my son. The price is a little too high for the product in my opinion considering its just plastic.
Really was amazed with how great this swimsuit turned out! Very comfy and fashionable!
"This is very, very pretty.  I sent it back because I wear between an 8 and a 7.  I may reorder it and see if I can get an insert for the 8 so it fits better.  I really enjoyed looking at it.  Beautiful color - it looks like alexandrite not a sapphire which I think is a good thing."
"Let me start by saying this was good for the price, as in since I only paid $17 I wouldn't mind paying a few more dollars for adjustments. I bought the small and I'm 4' 11"", 108 pounds and 34c fake boobs. The small fit good, it was stretchy, only things I didn't like we're the sleeves under the armpit, like other reviewers stated, you need tape to hold it on, it's because the way the bodysuit is sewn, when you move your arms at all it pulls the fabric up and away from your chest, causing your lady parts to fall out (at least mine did) so that I would have to have fixed (the armpit needs to be sewn higher up to prevent this from happening). Also the back doesn't fit snug to your back, so I worried with a bandage skirt on, it would make the back scrunch up and not lay flat like a normal bodysuit. That I would have to have fixed by taking the waist in on the sides so it fits my body better and doesn't have the extra fabric. I provided pictures of what I'm talking about with the armpit and the back. The picture of the back shows what it looks like circled, and what it should look like (with me pulling it tighter). Overall this is a great bodysuit for the price, it's very stretchy and thick material, so it's very well made. I sent mine back only because after debating, I didn't feel like I would get much use out of it here, maybe try it in southbeach or somewhere where I could wear more risqu things to the club, not this town! Haha"
"perfect, nice-looking and durable."
"I got these for my daughter-in-law for Christmas in aquamarine.  They sparkle and are very, very pretty.  I think she'll love them...if she doesn't, she can give them to me!  hahaha"
"This necklace was prefect for me because I love statement jewelry and the thought of blue roses. Genetic engineering may one day produce living blue roses, but until then the best I can do is dye white roses and wear this sparkling necklace and earring set by Everfaith. While I wouldn't recommend chopping firewood while wearing it, this necklace is sturdy enough that I don't worry about a broken link or having stones fall out. I found a headband to match, but not on Amazon. I don't know if&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flower-Blue-Austrian-Crystal-Metal-Roses-Headband/dp/B015VNZJVK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flower Blue Austrian Crystal Metal Roses Headband</a>&nbsp;will match or not. The picture of the necklace makes the stones seem less intense in color than they are in person. This set is exactly what I wanted, but if it's not for you, take a look at Everfaith's other items. They are addictive!"
get one size bigger
Great slip fit perfect and love the length.
Warm and stay on very well.
Good but it didn't fit me.
Excellent fit.  Extremely comfortable!!!
"These are very comfortable, although the lace band at top is slightly smaller than in previous years. The seam down the middle in back gives the slight definition I prefer for this panty."
Bought for my Daughter who loves Image this smells great like oranges and leaves her face refreshed and clean
"Very soft and comfy.  Fits great, nice length.  Strong velcro hold.  Very happy with product!"
"I love this plaid shirt by Meaneor. It is stylish and very well made. It fits exactly as the size chart indicates. I ordered the large and it is exactly what I wanted. I wear a 6-8 or medium in most shirts, but wanted to be able to comfortably wear a tank or t-shirt underneath this, so I ordered a larger size.

The material is soft but strong, it is not easily wrinkled (maybe not at all) and holds the collar and cuffs well. It is very nice looking on, and could easily be dressed up with dress slacks for a more pulled together look. All of the stitching was done with great attention and the pattern is lined up from panel to panel.

The colors and pattern are as they appear to be and are well saturated through the material. It does not look like it will fade at all over time. All of the button holes are well placed and stitched and each corresponding button fits through it's hole easily. The buttons are also solidly attached to the shirt. I found no stray threads on the entire shirt.

This shirt also has darting in the sides on the chest near the underarms to make it more form fitting for ladies. I like this feature, because often shirts like this do not and end up looking boxy and drab.

I received this item complimentary for my true and objective opinion. I personally tested this product and my assessment is not influenced by Amazon or the seller."
"They run a little big on me (med) and they have a shiny finish which I am not thrilled with, but they are very comfy and I have worn them a few times and they are good quality."
Cute and soft enough
Nice for the coast!
"Onex shoes have padding inside the lining and the toe divider is encased in a clear plastic tube, adding to the comfort. The color turquoise is beautiful and has quality detailed embellishments. Purchase a size larger than your regular size."
Very comfortable and they give the support I need.
this sandal are nice
looks good~!
Couldn't  beliebe my eyes when i saw  this piece...otd more  than one can imagine. Better thsn picture.price terrific. ...
"I like this shoe, but I feel like the sizing is about a half size too big. The back of the shoe slips off my heal. I like the color as they go with everything and they are comfy!"
Lined leggings great for under jeans in cold weather or as fashion leggings.
I purchased it as a gift for a friend. I like the quality and feel but not sure how it fits him
"Fits good, a bit tight from the bust area, so if you have a large chest I would suggest going up a size, other them that dress fits great, nice flow and fabric is not heavy or statikie. Very satisfied with my purchase!!!!"
"Very nice looking, and comfortable boots.  I didn't realize how comfortable until wearing them to work, and finding the padded footbed felt fantastic - almost like memory foam pillows to the soles of the feet.  I have had another pair of Clraks boots that was also super comfy.

Other reviewers commented on the toe being shiny - yes, it is, and I think it's an intentional part of the look of the boot (""distressed"", maybe?).  Anyway I think it looks nice  - gives a nice texture to the boot.  Not rain boots though, i will wear them when the weather is nice out."
Very soft and cushion-y. I have a lot of foot pain because of a heel spur and I also need a wider shoe.  Purchased these 1/2 size larger to have a bit more width and they worked out great.
these fit 1 size small..... normally wear a size 7 but had to go to a size 8 just to get on.. 1/2 sizes not available... I understand the negative comments about the lining if worn everyday..
I have gotten several shirts from Doublju.  I have not been dissapointed with any of them.  I love the different styles that I cannot find in my local stores.
Pretty socks  Comfortable.
I love the bag. I love the long handles on this bag. Looks trendy & durable.
Excellent for running!
Great shoe for doing errands or a quick trip to the park or zoo with the kids. A little roomy but not bothersome.
"This is a beautiful and very feminine dress.  It fits true to size.  I have not worn it yet, but I am looking forward to it."
fit as expected love them
I get at least 20 compliments on this a day!  I love it!!
"Good band overall that I bought to replace an ugly band that came with a Timex watch. However, the leather strip that secures the excess length of the band fell off within 2 months of use. Overall, very stylish with a classic appearance."
"Wonderful Shoes, Great Seller, Great Price, Thank You !"
My son loved his first pair so I bought a second in the next size up.  The shoe is a great quality and stood up to the hardest abuse.  I have a feeling that I will be buying a third pair when he outgrows these
Fits smaller then other belts but luckily still fit (barely) My boyfriend wears it all the time so it must work fine!
"I love this bra. Fits great. It keeps its shape and doesn't do the uniboob style. The straps and back are wide enough for good support for larger cup sizes. I also like the multi-colors. It's a good bra for everyday or exercise. It won't completely keep you from bouncing when running or high impact, but it's still a decent bra for the gym. It lifts really well and can make your chest look larger - so be aware if you are looking for a minimizer. It won't show cleavage even with larger cups. I really like the shape of this one. I plan to buy more in other colors."
Love these shoes. They fit just prefect. My fourth pair.
My teen only likes this brand and this didn't dissapoint!
Very cute sandals.  I have a very narrow foot and this brand tends to run narrow which is great for me.  The leather is very soft and the footbed is excellent.  I like the color a lot for summer too!
Great fit. Would definitely buy in other colors for next summer
Wife is very pleased. Sized perfectly
Cute top.. I like that hides flaws.
"Zumba classmates admire my scarf. The cloth is velvety. It has more coins than other types of scarves, but they make less noisenot sure why. It's encouragement to to shake harder. The knot slips if I don't double it."
Im 54 and 150lbs and the large fits perfect. Its not the most amazing quality but it looks great for the price and I only plan on wearing in once anyways
"Like 'em - they fit like normal shorts...not too darn short.
It's hard to find just normal shorts these days. Thanks!"
"Amazing price for these socks- great quality, will buy more!  I use these for running and they are awesome."
"These pants run quite large. I knew this from past purchases, so I intentionally ordered 2 inches smaller in the waist than any other pants that I own. They fit perfectly. Very durable jeans. Aside from confusing sizes, they are a great pair of jeans."
"My husband and I always referred to crocs as ""ugly shoes"" and wouldn't even try them because of that. Then I seen these crocs in black and thought they would look ok with jeans and would be easy to slip on and off for going outside for short periods of time. I have to admit  after wearing them just once I was hooked....OMG they are so so comfortable. I wore the black ones so much that I decided to get the brown ones as well. They are the best shoes ever!!!!"
"Nice, but the catch is on the wrong side."
Love the look & fit of these sneakers.
"I was surprised that this is such a nice jacket. All the inner seams are lined with hem tape and sewn in. The jacket itself is not lined, which makes it a great summer jacket. I hope it can be washed in cold water and hung to dry, as some others have indicated. I am 5'6,115 lbs and got a small. Fits just right and love the longer length. If I had a complaint it would be there is only one button when two or three would have been better."
"This sandal is very nice.
I was trying to replace a very similar sandal by this company.  It had extraordinary support in the  arch and the heel cupped my heel so nicely.  Alas, this new shoe is good but not quite as good.. I deducted one star as the fit and support wasn't as good."
Awesome!! Colors are bright and it fit right.
Much needed for our Snowpacalypse here in Central Oregon. My feet stayed warm and dry through all the snow and icey rain.
"Pretty happy with these in a size 10.5, which fits well, but the grey color seems to have a hint more brown than I expected.  Comfortable, and nice looking."
This cross-body travel bag is comfortable and has plenty of pockets and space.
The dress worked out perfect for my granddaughter!  She loved it and it fit her nicely!
Love the fit and how totally cute they are!
Fits about 1/2 size too small
"Definitely not genuine silver, because it turns my wrist green after some wearing.  But I love it.  It looks shiny and keeps my hair tie on it so it doesn't hurt my wrist."
Great shoe-good quality!!!
"Living in Phoenix, you might think that I wouldn't need these, but the mornings are cold here in the winter. Still wearing them in March."
"Shoe works great for flat footed monsters like me.  Provides me the adequate support needed to run.  I'm not a huge fan of running, but I have to do it and these allow me to run without the negative after affects."
Highly recommended as a long-lasting product. Surprised that a size 11 is a little tight to put on; always wore a 10-1/2. Feels OK after I get it on.
wonderful colors and quality.  Thank you.
"I have been using this Sandpiper Rolling Loadout Bag for 3 months now with no issues! I got it in green and love it. I use it to carry, store and travel with my firearms, ammo, targets, and other accessories. It has been awesome and very convenient.

the quality is great, I have no issues with it. I have thrown this in my trunk almost daily for 3 months and nothing has broken in any way, shape, or form, I think the quality is great. I compared this rolling bag to several other brands and this was the best value and most versatile for the money that I found on Amazon.

If I have any issues with it going forward, I will update my review."
"Perfect fit. Came right on time. I would definitely buy again and would definitely buy from this seller.

Stained my first one, had to buy another! Love it!"
These are exactly what I was looking for! Nice quality flip flops that fit my son's feet perfectly!
They are very well made and have great traction. Nice quality and very attractive as well.
My favorite shoe in the world! great for long hours on your feet. I own four colors...
"Absolutely adored these shoes, perfect for work or a date night. Only flaw was the strap broke the second time I wore them, a little on the thin/flimsy side but other than that, very cute."
"good fit and comfortable, lasts through a lot of washing too."
"Daughter was pleased with this, and is still wearing it today , washes up really well, and comes out of dryer ready to go"
"Super Comfortable! I have multiple pairs!  Love them! Wish we had more colors!
These are almost the same as the older style NEVUS!"
Better than photo ! Love it
I like it. It fits is cooler than regular baseball hat and perfect for the hot weather.  Not especially fond of the slightly distressed look but that is a minor thing.
These make organizing and packing luggage so much easier. Love how they keep everything in its place and separated. The expansion zipper allows several more items to fit in the bag. Bought the turquoise and the lime green and love them both.
"Just slightly snug but still fits fine. Be aware this is a Chinese made product and their clothing always run smaller than expected. If you are a medium get an XL for a proper fit. Very pretty, lacy, rose colored cover. Actually long enough and pretty enough to wear as a mini dress with the right slip underneath."
"These run small so I suggest ordering up a size bigger from your original. Two sizes if you want the snug look (and have big boobs lol). The customer service is amazing and I'll definitely be ordering more from this seller. :)

For sizing reference: I'm a 38D chest size with a somewhat small torso. I'm 5'9 and weight 160lbs. It covers the belt on my pants so it's fairly long. The sleeves are perfect and reaches my wrists even when I lift my arms. The bottom of the hoodie does not ride up when lifting my arms also. This item fit me snugly. It was not baggy and not too tight to where I couldn't breath lol. I would recommend this to other friends.

As for shipping, it came at my door about 1 week after ordering it so the shipping is definitely a plus.

Thank you, TheLees!!! :)"
"Bottom line is that this bundle is totally worth the price.

The flat contour brush is nearly identical to the Morphe M459. It's that blunt-cut flat chisel contouring brush that everyone in the makeup community is going crazy over. It's very soft, the bristles are densely packed and I have not noticed any fallout of bristles yet. However it has only been washed once. It picks up the perfect amount of product and fits into the hollow of my cheek nicely. I can use it to deposit the color more precisely then blend it out as well. It blends powder really well. The brush handle/ferrule seem sturdy as well, it's not loose at all. Overall this brush is a total steal.

The oval cream powder brush I haven't used as much as the contour brush but it's only because I don't know how to incorporate it into my personal routine. I use a sponge to apply liquid foundation & concealer and use a kabuki brush to apply powder. I have tried this brush for blush and highlight and it's done a decent job. The brush handle feels pretty cheap, it's a light plastic. I thought this would be a really affordable dupe to the Artis brushes makeup artists are raving over. I haven't had the chance to try an Artis brush because they're well out of my price range. I will say that this brush is, again, incredibly soft and densely packed just like the contour brush. It feels like HEAVEN. I want to just rub it around my face all day. This is a neat brush to try out and the price makes it worthwhile.

The sponge is the one item I could probably do without, which is why I rated 4 out of 5 stars. Once you've used a beautyblender, there's really no going back. This one is an okay substitute but not nearly as good as my beautyblender. It's very dense and almost tough feeling. The BB is very light and springy in comparison, and this is just about as opposite as you could get. It applies foundation and concealer alright but absorbs too much of the product for my liking. I do appreciate that the bundle comes with a small mesh bag you can put this sponge into to keep it clean while it dries.

Overall a very good affordable collection of beauty tools. I did receive a discount on my purchase of this set however my opinion is in no way affected by that. I like these bruses and sponge and use them regularly and would recommend them to others."
Beautiful tie set. The colors are rich and vibrant and the material has a wonderful quality feel. Landisun has never disappointed.
"I ordered a medium for my GF (5'3"", idk maybe 120ish pounds?). I'd usually get her a small for all bottoms, but I read another review that said these are asian sizes, and so are smaller than US sizes.

I didn't want my gf to feel bad about not fitting a small, so I just ordered the medium. Turns out, the medium was too big for her and she really did need the small. Also, the material is slightly stretchy so keep that in mind.

Really high quality. I was surprised because Ive seen my gf order other clothes online that come in and its like 4 pieces of clothe stitched together wrong. This was definitely something you'd see at a boutique shop. probably could resell them at a boutique if you had one."
"I have been running on these for about 4 months.  I put about 20 - 30 miles per week on them since I bought them with a grand total of just over 300 miles on them (I alternate between 2 pairs of these for longer life).  They have been going strong but are now starting to show signs it's time to replace them.  Most of my miles are on road pushing a baby jogger and these have held up to the task with flying colors.  Like most minimalistic shoes, yes you can feel sharp rocks but the rock is 2 steps behind you before your brain registers you stepped on it, at least that's how it does it with me.  These shoes have gone up to marathon distances without any issues.

I have only one gripe about them, you need to wear socks.  My first run in them was without socks, as I prefer to run in hotter weather.  I got a great big blister on my arch from a seam inside the shoe.  Since then I added a little body glide before long runs and have not had any issues.  I point this out because the shoe stated it was great for running without socks.  The time I got the blister it was only a 4 mile run so it was not like it was a long distance where I have learned to expect blisters.

Aside from this the shoes are  great investment.  I just ordered a new pair for a Christmas present to me."
"Not the cheapest, but the most comfortable I HAVE EVER HAD."
Love this shampoo! Recommended by a friend! Color really lasts!
"it is great i love it really really nice i ordered L and it was my fault, i should ordered my size: M cause it is not tight clothes.  good quality any way."
"Amazing stuff, does not clog my pores, keeps my skin hydrated through the day and the sunscreen is +++ Would buy again."
gave as gift.
"Outstanding fit, keeps me warm and nicely made"
This wedge looks Great !!!!!!!!!! on my feet.  It is not too high or too low.  You can wear it to dress up or dress down.  I love it
Super comfortable and adjustable.  Love these shoes!
"They arrived a day early, so getting them so quickly is a nice bonus.

I ordered up a half size to allow for comfort giving the fact it's lined with furry goodness :).  It's a VERY VERY comfortable boot --- I have no complaints .  I feel like I could wear them all day with no issue.

Glad I got them during a sale and so glad I did!"
"This is soooo cute! I love the style, fits great, shows off all my assets while still being modest. Great for lounging around the pool (and yes, you can definitely swim comfortably!). I got the one with the red top and polka dot bottoms. I'm very large breasted (38DDD), so I was worried the top might be too tight, but the fit is fantastic and has the proper amount of support to keep the ladies in check."
"My granddaughter loves it. It took a few seconds days longer to get but well worth the price. I ordered the 3y to 5y and she is 5 years old average size, there is still room for her to grow. So a 3y to 5y for a 3 year old would probably be big on them."
This is the perfect tennis shoe --- no laces!! Very comfortable and great for walking.
Better than expected.  Each pair came individually packaged.
Teenager loves these. Not see through. Hold up well. Tons of compliments.
Great fit and super cute
Works as a nice casual shoe gold color goes with most outfits
"Nice shoes - cool style. if the arch support is too much, you can easily remove the extra material. Comfortable and fits true to size."
My son loves these bracelets.
"I have never been a sandal wearer because I treasure the use of my toes too much to be jamming them into foreign objects,rocks, gravel, stickers and splinters. But that was before I discovered Keen. That big black toe box that I used to think was ugly on casual shoes has now become a required element on every shoe I buy. It's a lot like the VW Beetle- you grow to love it. I love Keen and now have casuals, winter boots and hiking boots with the same beautiful big black toe box. I finally gave in and bought the sandals. Now my toes are still happy but my feet can enjoy the air that they haven't felt in many years of wearing sneakers. PEW! The soles on these are amazingly comfy and they are really well made in real leather and waterproof unlike most sandals. I'm impressed."
great sandals for everyday use
The dress fit as described and looked really good. Was very happy with the purchase
"I love my new swimsuit! I am 5'6, 190lbs, and wear a C40 in bra and I ordered a 16W XXL and it fit perfect! The color is brighter in person and it's super adorable and cute without showing what I don't want to show! I definitely recommend this. It holds my tummy in and makes me look great despite being bottom heavy. Very pleased with this purchase."
"I am a devotee of Cuddl Duds. If you live in a cold climate, I highly recommend that you give them a try -- especially the pants. Tops are nice too but the pants are absolutely amazing."
These wallets are made of exceptionally nice leather.  I wanted small for my small handbags.  I got a brown one and then ordered one in black as well.  Just beautifully made.
"A couple of things stood out to me with these - first the material is very thin/light (55% cotton, %45 polyester) which at first I was unsure about, but they are very comfortable, and time will time to see about durability. They are Hanes though, so I'm not too worried. The second thing that is new to me is the leg holes seem narrower than I'm used to. I'm thinking this helps keep things contained, which it certainly seems to. I thought it might limit mobility of my legs, but maybe only a couple times have I even noticed them. So all good!"
These are the best for running around in the house during winter.
"I was so excited to recieve my Sanita Gwenore clogs today, the pattern design and color were perfect but to my dismay they were way too small. Hoping the next size up fits. Really sucks because they were over nighted to me and now because its the weekend I have to wait extra long. Tomorrow morning I will be returning these to UPS.

Just trying to help someone else not experience the same thing. These adorable clogs run WAY TOO SMALL."
"These are my new favorite pants for when jeans don't quite work, but I don't want to be too dressed up.  They look great with gym shoes, loafers or wing toes and seem like they are great quality pants!"
"I love the shoulder bag, its spacious and has alot of compartment to put ur items in. Very happy, so happy that I'm going to buy another one but in a different color."
"The Fit Flop Banda sandal is awesome, but this line does fit smaller than the regular line. I'm usually an 8 in the regular styles, but needed a 9 in the Banda. The look is sleek and less casual than the regular FitFlops, very happy with these and the stone color is a great neutral. Can't wait to wear these. When it gets warmer!"
I love this tennis shoes. They are very comfortable. I can walk all day with them. I am size 6 but I ordered 6.5 and it was a great idea. I use them with socks so they are super comfy. I am going to buy another pair in different color. I really like them .
The fit is great and the soles are so comfortable!! Love these!
"Great halloween costume, half the price of the same one in the Halloween store at the mall.  It fit my daughter perfectly, she is between a 12 and 14 youth size."
Very very comfortable. You can be in these shoes and on your feet all day and no discomfort. Great delivery time.
Snug fit and easy on knee joint while running.
Excellent shoe perfect for going from water to hiking.  Can be worn while trudging across the river as well as hiking rocky terrain. We bought them for the whole family. My kids play in these all day and they dry quickly.
I used these for a family wedding.  They look great and don't appear inexpensive.
Part of a  Hippie Party we have coming up!
I love them. Just like the picture and Ive never had anything issues with the design coming off or anything.
This dress is lovely but OH MY GOODNESS.  I ordered a size larger than I needed and should have ordered 2 or 3 sizes larger.
Saving it for pregnancy.
"This short is good quality but it was a little bigger than I thought it would be. The short was about an 1 inch shorter than I normally wear, too."
Shoe trees were a gift no feedback at this time.
"I like this ring, it's cute and I bought it because I wanted to wear it with other rings or by itself. This isn't my first purchase with Metal Factory so I had pretty high expectations. I was just a little disappointed with this ring because I just recieved the ring and noticed that one of the prongs holding the stone is pretty high. It kinda catches on my clothing and I'm a little concerned that the stone with eventually fall out because of it. To be fair, the ring is such a low price ($2) so it's not totally surprising. It's not super noticeable either unless you are really looking at the ring closely so I'm not too bothered by it."
"While there is some arch support, I would like a little more.

These shoes are so comfortable that I can and do wear them everyday.  They are lightweight, quiet, and comfortable all over my foot.  I'd like a pair in every color!"
"Ordered these for my dad, he can never have enough work socks."
"Very nice, well made, as described."
"It's cute, spacious, better than the generic flip flops. But arch support? Not much...."
"My daughter emailed me with a link to these boots on a different site, asking me to 'use my magic' to find them online, hopefully at a lower cost than the ones she had found. I found them on Amazon, then decided rather than refer her to them, I would simply buy them for her upcoming birthday at the end of September. She lives in another state, but flew home the day I placed the order. They arrived during her visit, and she went nuts over them! (this was before she even opened the box).After squeezing the sh*t out of me with a hug, she grabbed the boots and put them on. They were gorgeous at first sight! They fit exactly the way she hoped, they looked the way she had hoped, and in fact, she wore them Friday evening to an event only a few hours after getting them! She wore them for about 7 hours, and commented that they were still comfy. BEST hundred bux spent for her, if I do say so myself! Great job, Chinese Laundry, and bravo, Amazon Prime, for once again coming through for me, with next day shipping for a mere 3.99, which was so so worth it! Buy them, you'll love them!"
Love these and will be buying more!!
"Really awesome product. Although we've only used it once so far, it was a breeze adjusting and putting on my son. Some Pro's and Con's..

Pros:
- Very professional and attractive packaging.
-Liked the idea of a product that could be registered for warranty
-adorable design/pattern
-Nice material
-Company seems to take much pride in their product
-The ""for best results"" and ""for worst results"" instructions on the tag for washing was a cute and humorous addition

Cons:
- I didn't like that the rivets on the inside were all the way through both layers of material. I feel as though that would get annoying or even painful on baby's skin. I read in a review somewhere that the newer version has the rivets through only the first layer of material so they don't rub on baby's skin, but that wasn't the case for the item I received, and I was under the impression that I was purchasing whatever model was up-to-date for this product.
- Says it fits 8-36 pounds, however my son is 3.5 months old, and although he's huge for his age, he's 17.5 pounds and on the last set of snaps for width adjustment, and the middle setting for rise adjustment. This is a disappointment, as it won't last longer than this summer."
"This is a really pretty dress. I love the color and the fit.  I'm 5' 3"" and 183. It fits nicely. So glad I purchased it."
But I love the slinky material!
Beautiful earrings....they really do stand out!
"This is a very nice, warm jacket and the colors look great. I bought this form my 5 year old son who is 38 lb and wears a size 6 shirt. It fits him nicely with a bit of room to grow. This will be a perfect jacket for this fall through next spring."
"That is some serious pink.  The picture makes it look light a light nude, but it's PINK."
I've been wearing them all summer so they've been washed a number of times and seem to be holding up fine & of course they're very comfortable. Yes dispite the name i am a female.
"This is smaller than I pictured, but very cute and looks good on. Would recommend for someone looking for something a little different, but not big and bulky."
"These are super cute and look more expensive than what they are. I bought them for a retro ""devil in disguise"" costume, but I'm tempted to wear them as a fashion statement as well!"
"People told me to buy icebreakers to keep me warm, i did.  I got the best they had to offer.  They didn't keep me warm.
However, the Duofold worked great!!!  I live in an area where the temps drop to 15F, these kept me warm.  I absolutely love them!!"
"Great for hiking and camping,  dries quickly, comfortable.

Columbia Boy's identifying the pant is the link.  Click on it"
"When I lost one of my beloved sets of filigree earrings, I thought I would never be able to replace them.  I found these and was very impressed with them.....very shiny, not heavy and super price."
"I am 6' 1"" I weigh about 185 pounds. Athletic build. The large was too tight especially in the chest and arms. I ordered an XL and it is on the way. Other than the size difference it appears soft and rather comfortable"
I thought they were thicker than what they were but I miss read the description.
"Always been a fan of Kipling luggage and this backpack is no exception. I had another similar backpack stolen on a trip to Costa Rica and realizing it was getting so heavy to carry around at the airport while waiting for flights (I used it as a carry on with all sorts of stuff in it including my laptop, which is still somewhere in CR, I think :() - I wanted something that wouldn't strain my back. This bag is fairly light and SO easy to maneuver, it's awesome. You can stuff a water bottle into the side, a hoodie into the front, it holds my laptop plus everything I need for overnight including a change of clothes. It's perfect for me - my next purchase is going to be a matching duffle bag. LOVE Kipling, they're such quality products made to last. I think of it as a travel investment that will last me for years. Unless it gets stolen again, haha. Cheers!"
Very nice. My boyfriend looks very handsome in it.
"Bought them for mother inlaw,and she loves them"
"Love this watch!  I've been looking for a daily watch in the Pilot/military style.  Everything I came across was either automatic/manual or over my ""daily watch"" price point.  My other watch is an automatic and a pain to maintain.  I'm always adjusting it. This is a great looking quartz watch under $200 and just keeps on ticking.  Btw, Seiko also makes a similar one in automatic if you really want one.

One thing that is worth mentioning is that when the chronograph is operating, the 1/20 hand is constantly spinning.  I'm not sure if that is a good or bad thing (perhaps it wears the battery down???).  I had a Tag Heuer Chrono where the fractional hand did not move until you either split or stop it."
"have to admit was very surprised with the quality and fit and colour of this Jacket. sort of expected it to be no good because of the price, but love it, everything was as described, love it love it."
"These boots are amazing,they run true to size and there is no need to break them in they are comfortable from the get go. I am an avid down hill skier and as a result I have have large calf muscles and typically have a hard time wearing 12 or 14 inch boots but these fit great. The back laces make them easy to adjust and the side zipper makes it so you don't have to keep adjusting them. I have worn these with pants and skirts they are cute and sassy. I would buy these again :-)"
"Uggs.  Great quality, warm...what more can you ask for?  Quick shipping and easy exchange since my daughter's foot grew!"
Fit perfect. Arrived quickly. Good quality.
"They were beautiful, fit just like they should. They're the most comfortable heels in my collection even with them being almost 6inch heels. Look just like the picture and I would recommend again"
Very nice quality. Thick and well made
My son love it and so do I. It's nice and durable and went well with the sports bag we also purchased.
"I'm 5'4"" and 115 lbs. I got a size small and these fit great all along my body. These look really cute, but these are slightly long on me and I'll have to alter the straps to be a little shorter so that my bra doesn't show."
"This lightweight handheld luggage scale is the sort of thing that you'll never need until you really need it-- I write this sentence as someone who has had to repack my bags in the middle of the International Departures terminal of the international airport in Porto, Portugal.

It's simple to use: you simply pass the heavy canvas strap though the handle of your suitcase, hook it,and lift your bag by the double handle of the scale.  The weight can then be read in the LCD window, in either pounds or kilograms (you can switch them back and forth at the push of a button-- no math is involved!).  The weight is measured in tenths of a pound or 50 gram increments.

It's easy to use and easy to pack, as it weighs less than five ounces-- and the fifteen bucks you'll pay for it is nothing compared to the fifty bucks they'll charge you for an overweight bag!  [The only reason I've given this scale four stars, vice five, is that there are others on Amazon with more features for the same price.]

Recommended.

2 xist bikini brief  is great well-made and formfitting. These briefs are your go to underwear or for me that is. I am at 156 pound  have a 30 inch waist and purchased a small which is perfect.  plenty a room in the front for those well endowed guys!
"This is every bit as great a fit as Wacoal's. Perfect fit, nice back detail and not padded! I wear a 36C, way big enough. I plan on buying more of this bra."
great price for a great jacket!
"Nice fabric, good fit."
"I started doing a body shave after losing a bet. Turns out I like the feel. I've tried various ways to get a close shave. Gillette has come up with the best way I've found to date. The head's shape helps avoid nicks. The three blade design offers a close, comfortable shave. Give it a try. I think you will be happy."
roomy fit nice quality
"Made from thick, sturdy plastic so it's not flimsy at all. It has elastic on either side that you tie to fit your head, so it has a stretchy, comfortable fit. It fit my 10 yr old son with plenty of room to spare, so would definitely fit an adult head. The gold color is very dull (even a little more dull than what's pictured), so I spray painted it a nice, bright true gold. It was perfect for my son's Zeus costume!"
Love them- so soft and warm.  I did have to tighten the strings so they wouldn't slip off the heal.
"I really really like this dress. The only thing is it's really short. I'm 5'8 and I have to wear shorts under it or leggings. It feels more like a spandex than polyester, the design really stretches over my chest, I'm a 38 DD. Other than that I love the design, huge Star Wars nerd, and I love how it looks on me."
very nice -........loved it
love these sweats
I'm a big fan of crocs.  These are very comfortable but they run big.  I usually wear a 9 but these 9s are too big.  Luckily a medium weight sock helps that problem.  I bought a light blue and black pair.  Light blue is a big light but the black are really sharp with black pants.
These sneakers are a hit.
Liked so much I reordered another set!
"Super cute, but the XXL size fits my size medium friend. Order larger for a good fit.  I was given a discount on this item inumber exchange for a fair and honest review."
I never Cary a purse for more than a few weeks. I've been carrying this for months. There is absolutely no downside to this. I'm probably going to be getting another for summer but will go back to this in the fall. Of course the little scarf thing came off immediately but that's just personal preference.
This belt is very high quality both elastic and buckle. I wasn't expecting such a great belt at this price so will certainly buy more in other colors.
"Stuffed paper in the ears to keep them in shape, otherwise, pretty good.  The back is slit vertically, with long strip of velcro to keep it closed.  It fit large adult.  Of course, it is hot and sweaty after a while."
"The dress is amazing, it's simple yet classic. I am very impressed. Upon opening the package, I thought it might be too big for me however when I try it on it's perfect.

I am petite, about 4'11, I ordered size small and it's exactly what I needed. The material of the dress is very soft and comfortable, as a matter of fact it is stretchy and pure cotton..I am pretty sure it is durable. I wash it cold and tumbled dry.

There are several colors to choose and I got mine in color Jade. It is remarkable because I have stilleto in color Jade too and when I wore it to work everybody was so impressed how I carry my nice dress. My husband even said wear that to our date night..

I got this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. I am definitely satisfied with what I got. The delivery was great, the quality is perfect.

This dress is good for all occasion, wear it to work, church, party, home, shopping. It is suitable for spring,summer and fall season. I love it and it is one of my favorite dress to wear now."
"SO cute! It fits the bust and just floats over my belly, hiding everything. I feel really pretty in this top."
"Fit well, feel good, look good and are fairly durable"
Face is easy to read. Fits well and teal color is nice.
We loved the shirt but it was for a slim man and it needed to be more fitted.  It would fit the average tall man great.
I was a little hesitant to buy it but I am sure glad that I did. There's just enough pockets to divide all my stuff just the way I like it and it's not huge.
True to size and very comfy!
Fits nice great piece i am so happy with it i would buy as a stocking stuffer really really great
great slippers seco d pair first pair wore out was hoping to get the family guy but nothing this comfortable u cant beat these homers.....  weere are my homers the floors cold u will be saying
"Omg. I'm so happy I ordered these! Expensive but we'll worth it! They fit perfectly. I did get a size bigger than normal due to other reviews. It was a good idea since they fit perfectly now. Also, it told me my boots wouldn't be here until Tuesday, guess what? It's Saturday!!! I'm wearing them right now thanks so much! I'm glad to find a wide calf that isn't too wide for me! The average calf is 15inch and under, mine are 15 and 1/2 and these aren't quite snug so they fit great!!!!! I will be ordering more in the future with this company."
"Good.  Not great.  You get what you pay for  Pretty flimsy, but for a beach wedding so it worked. I liked it."
These are my go too flats.  Very comfortable and I absolutely love the worn in leather look.
"Thus sweater is so soft! I am 5'2"" 130 lbs and got the small. I love the fit , it is very flattering. I got compliments on this sweater."
They keep my feet warm
"These shoes are a bit roomier in the toe box than expected but the rest of the shoe fits well enough that they don't move around or cause weirdness in the snug areas. I could probably fit comfortably in a half size down. I got these for walking my dog, I usually walk but sometimes run so I haven't been too hard on them yet. They are nice and bright and people keep asking me if I got new shoes but I have had them for several months. I don't go around hopping in mud pits or anything but they seem really easy to keep clean and nice looking. Just don't step in dog doo, they have lots of nooks & crannies on the soles and you'll be cleaning for a while. They have lots of nubbies so good traction, if you wear them in shallow snow/ice conditions with yak traks you will be unstoppable!"
"Just as discribed. Runs about a size larger, i'd order a smaller size next time. Great layering tee shirt. Thinner material but not see through."
It's works perfectly
"good quality, cotton"
"Pretty good, not great. A little more orange than expected."
"Love it. I am very picky with  my Brass. I like them to hold me up with no spill over. This
was perfect"
"Purchased for a Halloween costume, not for regular daily wear. Still, if I needed a wig for any reason, I'd use this one. It's a bit longer than I need (accurately described by seller), but the hair covers very well despite some who've said it's too thin on top. Recommended!"
So cute! Sizing is accurate and good quality material.
Thicker material.  Very nice.  Definitely not for summer months' early mornings!  Colors haven't faded.
"Good slip-on, nice memory foam inside, color is a darker navy than shown."
"Even though they are a bit larger fitting than  my daughter wanted, they are great and of very good quality materials."
"This dress was beautiful on my daughter. It fit so well! My daughter is 3 but petite for her age (she wears 2t as well) and it fitted her just right, not big or small. I recommend getting a size up if your child is average size for their age, because it might be little too tight for others. Plus the material isn't stretchy so you don't want it to be too uncomfortable for your child. Over all the dress is so beautiful and not cheap looking at all!! It's a steal for this price!"
"This was a fun holiday top,....flirty and feminine,....with a whimsical flare,....I'm not normally a clothes horse kinda person,....but every so often something catches my eye,.....this did,....and was everything I had hoped it would be,....so I'm glad I splurged. :D"
Good buy these.
"Bought these for my mom and she adores them! One day as she was wearing them in a grocery store, she noticed a stranger kept following her closely through the store with her phone out, looking at Mom. The lady finally came up to Mother and said she kept trying to get a good picture of the shoes she was wearing because she thought they were so cute! So of course, Mom posed for a ""footsie"" picture! So the moral of the story is, these shoes are so cute, strangers may follow you! Plus, they are extremely comfortable she says. These are the 2nd Bernie Mev shoes she's worn."
Super cute and comfy. This is only my second pair of TOMS but I really like them.
Love these...will definitely be getting more of them.
"These are a great value and long lasting. I've purchased several pair over the years. It doesn't hurt to have a little give on the waistline either, especially this time of year."
This jade is transparent. The size is good too. The color is white instead of a little green on picture. Also the company mention it is grade A jade. So it should be nature without treatment. It is a nice product I believe.
Just perfect accompanying little dresses to give her outfits a finished look for when it is cooler in Florida.  The fit was true to size.
"Purchased for my mother as she has bunions, calluses and problem nails (she let them get overgrown - I take her to a foot doctor to get her nails cut as they are much too thick for a regular pedicure).  She enjoys them and they are extremely comfortable and her walking has gotten much better.  She really needed the double wide.  I went to many shoe stores but could not find a pair to fit her comfortably."
This shirt not only fit me perfectly but was an overall beautiful shirt. I did feel the need to wear a black tank top underneath as the lace part of it showed my bra and a lot of cleavage. No biggie though. It just added an extra layer that was well needed when I wore this shirt out for date night. It flattered my body very nicely. I ordered XL and it fit perfect. I am a 40D and I still had room to spare. Not tight at all. I like comfortable and it was definitely just that. *Received for review purposes. All opinions are my own.
I love that these are autism puzzle print.  I wear a size 7 so they are a little big but very supportive on feet.  Still in process of breaking them in but love them anyway.
"I like it. A nice cotton blend. I'm 5'3 121 and I bought a small. A bit more lycra to nip and tuck and it would perfect, but it fits wonderfully. Not to tight. Not see through as far as I can tell either."
"I was really surprised by the quality of this key chain, the metal treatment is fantastic and in a dark grey metal and shiny look! I just wish that the back of the key chain wasn't a flat metal surface, but a mirrored version of the logo or some graphic pattern of some kind."
"After couple of disappointing pairs of Sorel boots I ordered these as I love my Keen sandals. The boots fit as I expected, they look so cute with skinny jeans & are lovely & cosy warm."
"Flexible, light and high quality product !My  son loves it!!!
Very nice design, so soft, easy wearing,right size and high quality sandals.
My son almost 1 year 8 months, pretty big boy and wears one or two sizes more...I bought him size 7,actually he wears size 5.5- 6
So he's wearing sandals just two weeks, and every day he asks to wear these sandals immediately after waking up in the morning, and all day walking in them, he's loves them so much...I and my husband was impressed:)))"
"My wife loves them. I'm writing this review after one day of use. No issues. The rhinestones/ all screws are secure. I will update review if an issue arises. Go Cards, ready to Protect the Nest!!!"
"Very good. It it not too thick, but fit well, stay on. I am 5', 100lbs. I ordered a second one after the first purchase. There is a little smell when arrive. But it goes away totally after two wash."
"I bought this for my two year old son worried that it was going to be too large, but the moment I put it on him it fit perfect! The quality of the material is very good and the fleece liner is not only warm but also very soft.  Our son usually hates wearing any kind of outer garment but he refused to take this off and stop playing.  The only thing I had a problem with was the thin outer layer which can be easily ripped if caught in a sharp object but I did not take a star off though because that is expected for many types of child jackets. The ski pants have blousing straps above the ankle which will repel snow from entering their shoes.  I would recommend to anyone especially for the great price."
pants were a little big but thats fin its cute so it will last him longer
"I have two pairs of these, and they are so comfortable! I usually wear an 8.5 or a 9. The 8.5 in these fit great!"
"great for the price.  seems like it's designed for thin socks and casual wear versus bare foot, swimming, outdooring."
my fave!!!!
Love it but I am tie dye grandma
My sister won't take it off!

I have purchased quite a few for work and they always impress. I got this for a work party in Las Vegas. I wanted something classy but also warm considering it was in the 30s. I love the longer cuffs on the sleeves! Nice comfortable material and great to pair with tights or leggings. It fits true to size and is meant to hug your natural curves. I received a free product to review. I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way."
This t-shirt looks better in person than it does in this picture.  It's really cool and you don't need to be a Big Bang Theory fan to appreciate it.  I got it as a gift for a teenager and he loved it!
Great expensive shoes at an incredible price. Much prettier than pictured. I have them in 2 colors. Very adjustable with the shoe strings. Nice comfortable padding. A super bargain for wonderful walking shoes.
The fit is as expected and very comfortable.
Fit too tightly to be comfortable; have to wait until I lose some weight to wear them.
I've received more compliments for this tie than any other I've worn lately. I'm not a big fan of polyester ties but this one is nicely constructed
Warm and staying dry.
"My daughter wore this as part of her Halloween costume this year.  I was hoping to remove the ribbons, but they are permanently attached.  The quality is very good especially for the price.  The wig is on the small side. It just fits my daughter and she has a small head. I doubt she will be able to wear it next year."
Looked even better in person than it did in the picture. Love it! Can wait to wear it.
You can not go wrong with this technology
Bought as a gift...looks and feels great
tag on pocket needs to be sewn on instead of iron on and FORCE iron on on sleeve has already come off after 2 washings
These are fun shoes and look good.  very comfortable
I have very wide feet & wear orthotics. They fit great. This is my second pair. Hard to find extra wide shoes that don't have a lot of color on them.
I LOVE them  I say somewhat small because they are slim fit. I bought them for myself (female) and they fit me perfect :-) they look super cute work a pair of jeans on a casual day already bought more
Love love this one waiting to buy a black one
"I have a wide foot, between a c and d width. These boots fit perfectly! I could wear them all day. I do agree they need some cushioning so buy some insoles. For someone, like me, with a hard foot to fit, they are a lifesaver and soooo cute!"
Lovely soft fabric and attractive print!
These are comfortable and are also durable! I wear these pants in Afghanistan and for the summer heat they are great!
Perfect for my socks to wear in bed after I have lathered my feet with foot balm.
My daughter is a my little pony fan and was happy to finally get some mlp pjs.
Cute and easy to get off and on for all the bathroom breaks.
"I expected to run like the Six Million Dollar Man, but have settled for the actual ability of a Six Dollar Man.  I have come to like the Hoka brand over time and distance mileage.  The dogs do not bark near as much with long run days (15 miles plus)."
it was a little big to my liking. my fault didn't read description
"These ties are lovely, right size and colors for just the right price! I only gave 5 stars because one of the ties had a stain on it as if it was used and sent back. Not good, but I can have it cleaned, shouldn't have to, but its no big deal. I would recommend this set!"
"I think it's a beautiful purse and the right size, but I didn't buy it for myself. It is a Christmas present for my daughter."
"Nice shoes, perfect color."
"I like this watch, although I omitted to check if the cover opens 180 degrees (it does not -- a weakness for my purposes). This is not a beautiful watch, and therefore not a collectors' item (at that price, what can you expect?!) but a useful one with a simple, practical look. The free engraving is a nice touch and the chain with the belt hook renders the watch all the more useful. Enjoy!"
"I LOVE these sandals -- I bought 2 pairs 2 summers ago, and bought this 3rd pair in a diff. color.  I wear them to work, BBQs, outdoor concerts where I am on my feet all day / night in high-heat & dancing, and because I am short, they give me the lift of height without the height in heel-only, putting strain on the ball of my foot.  They are my fav. pair of sandals, ever."
"I'm a size 6.5 with a narrow foot. They nice and comfortable from the beginning. However, the top did chafe the top of my foot a bit, but it wasn't bad. That's why I only gave it four stars."
"I love this bag so much my fav purse..i like everything about it....packaging, price, quality etc....happy happy happy!"
"Not extremely high quality, but they are very stylish! Made for casual wear & not for outdoor endeavors. Thin soles!"
"Great watch, looks nice and several people have asked in passing if it was a Rolex."
"These were a little bit larger than the ones I first saw but I really like them.  They are sturdy and do their job.  Bought these as gifts and so far, everyone has enjoyed them."
Very good quality for the price. They are the classic pearl earring and was surprised at the quality. Can't tell they are not MIKIMOTO quality pearls. Extremely happy with the purchase.
"Beautiful set! Can't believe how beautiful it is for the price in person. Fit very well and looks incredibly unique and sparkles. Wish we found this set sooner! This purchase was supposed to be a temporary replacement for my engagement ring (which is a halo whose micro pave diamonds fall out too often to wear). Now I am obsessed! I don't think I will wear the other one for a while. This was a great purchase and I would recommend this set to anyone who likes/loves black diamonds, may be on a budget, or just doesn't want to pay a high price for unique quality pieces. Please note: in the photos I am also wearing my original wedding band which is a simple rose gold band with 7 black diamonds. Looks amazing together. Do not hesitate! The pictures do NOT do it justice!!!"
Best Hat and  Best Price
"This item will not be opened and/or used until after Christmas morning, so I don't really know details of whether we'll like it or not.  However, the delivery was quick and packaging was good and we're anticipating that Santa will ""deliver"" it on Christmas.  :-)"
My friend loves them...has compliments every time he wears them!
Not too impressed for the $$
"My daughter wore this in a wedding, looked great and had beautiful details on the flowers!  The fit was to size."
"Very cute bootie. A tan grey suede color. Runs a bit small for my wife feet. I would recommend sizing up a half size. The zipper is odd compared to my other boots. Most are on inside,these are on outside which is a cute detail but a little awkward to don and doff."
received it very early and is a great ring thank you very much
This is the bag I've been looking for  big enough for everything but not so big it weighs you down. I will be buying more like this one.
"I wasn't happy with the edges because I thought that was corny. This fit my boyfriend though so I can't complain since he's like a triple hundred xl. Joking, he's a 2X."
Most comfortable sneaker I've worn as of late... On my feet all day and my feet thank me for buying these AGAIN!!!
"As everyone states, this product runs a half to full size large.  It was a tuff choice to go either full or half size, but I went with a half size smaller (norm wear 8 and ordered 7.5 (E) because I have wider feet).  Could not have been happier.  One of the best fitting pairs of shoes/boots I own and worked flawlessly as a work boot first day on job.  Of course, needs a bit breaking in but working all day climbing ladders and such that requires painting a two-story building, this boot worked flawlessly and did not hinder my performance from day one.  I expected sore feet/some sores from breaking in, especially first day use, but did not experience any.  Being prior military, this boot is solid and is a great investment in not only my safety on the job, but overall health to my body.  Im very satisfied with this purchase and would highly recommend this work boot to everyone."
Very comfortable. Had to get used to feeling as if I was walking on sponge but like them now.
"I adore them,I got several of them"
"These shoes are really comfortable to stand in, but the plastic coated strip up the top of the toes means they bend really oddly and rub on your toes when you run (or otherwise flex the toe box). I'm hoping that this is something that'll loosen up/break in over time, but the first few wearings have definitely made me aware of this flaw! It's not painful, per se, but it's just irritating enough that I think over multiple miles, it could end up ouchy.

The cushioning, however, is GREAT. I really appreciate Altra for making zero-drop running shoes that still have that ground-protection. I run mainly on asphalt and while I love my Nike Bionic Frees and New Balance Minimus Zeros for sprints and gym work, I like a little more padding between me and the gravel and concrete when I'm putting in the miles!

Aesthetic note: be aware that the colors are SUPER bright and, when combined with the wide toe-box, can remind you of clown shoes or bowling shoes. I don't find this a drawback, personally, but I understand why someone else might."
great insoles!
"Nice fit, nice feel."
"These are very comfy with the stretchy waist band, nice quality. The color is a bit darker that what the picture shows, it's more like a khaki."
Levis rock!
"Always know when the Lee label is on something  it represents quality. I always  check  out  the reviews  before ordering  and I'm  glad I  did. I usually  order a size 12 but went up a size  to 14 to take in a small amount of shrinking  after washing others mentioned . Glad I  did!  The skirt is a nice classic  design and will be great to wear for casual errands etc. I would  have  given  it 5 stars,  but it  needs ironing when it comes out of the  dryer - and believe me I  get things  out fast so I  don't  have to iron!"
I work on my feet most the day and these keep me feeling comfortable and happy. My feet are no longer are hurting at the end of the day
Very cute for the price.  Good bargain.
"Well made, comfortable, and packable.  The buckle is way tougher than it looks.
Unobtrusive and safe way to carry your cash and cards.  Highly recommended."
"Watch itself is great
Bracelet is ok
Hard to beat value"
Perfect fit and comfortable after several hours of walking. More than satisfied with quality and price.
"its beautiful and very well made....plenty of room for a full figure. And my husband said ""wow"" when i walked down the stairs wearing it."
This is a very comfortable top.  I can wear it to work and with jeans.
Feels so sexy on me... I'm a male that wears a 36-38 waist Jean.
those are good looking shoes. leather not bad. fits true to the size. there are a few points that are difficult to make up from the picture. the toe is actually square. i did not expect it. also they will not fit if you have  wide foot. strangely enough considering roomy front it is rather narrow where the lases start and hits the widest point of your foot. color is also beautiful. it is a little lighter then a picture. it is a very good buy  for the money. i returned my purchase because of the outline of the toe. i really did not want it square. i was looking for something a little more elegant. if that feature does not bother you go for it. those a good looking casual shoes.
Bought these for a friend who got hip surgery. She said they were very comfortable - even on her stitches.
"very comfortable, good support"
"I bought this watch for my boyfriend for his 31st birthday and he loved it! I looked at so many watches and had to decide between this watch and the brown Kenneth Cole watch which is the same style. I ended up going to a department store so that I could see the watches in person. When I saw the two, I knew the Gunmetal was the one for my boyfriend.
This is a great quality watch and you can clearly see the inner working of the timepiece. It's sophisticated, masculine and exceptionally made!
This is a great gift for that guy who already has everything!!"
"These are the best no-show socks I've had. Great price for eight pairs of socks, and I love the different colors. I'm a men's size 10 shoe and these socks are a little snug on me (honestly I'd prefer them to be tighter rather than more loose.) Hopefully that doesn't equate to them tearing or wearing thin too soon. There is a little bit of sticky stuff behind the heel that helps these stay up on your heel, and it's amazing. I've seen complaints that the shipping time is long, but I bought them as a Prime item so I got two-day shipping. Zero complaints so far."
"My son loves the 5 pocket Docker jeans, purchase one pair at JCPenney two weeks prior, at double the
price. Then ordered him a second pair for work and school. True to size, little shrinkage if any. Comfortable and great fitting
relaxed pants. Also have a older son who I used to buy the same style pants for in college he also loves the fit and style."
"perfect rich color, wine but not too red just right
very comfortable and warm with the fleece(?) lining
im short but still come to calf , don't look overwhelming"
I got a half size to big thinking I'd need the room with them being steel toed. Surprisingly i need my regular size and they'll be oh so comfortable!
"Great costume, fits ok, only concern is the belt, a little tight for size Large. I need extend it with velcro"
My wife loves the robe but the smallest size was Large/XL (?) and normally she orders a large but thought it was better to have it a bit big than a bit small.  If there was just a large size it would probably have been better but she has decided to keep it regardless.
Wish the size was more accurate.
"Beautiful, soft, lightweight, warm, high quality, arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  I have bought several of these over the years from this seller.  Will most likely buy more."
Great bra and nice details.
"These leggings are AWESOME!!!! They fit nicely and they are super soft. It feels so good when you put them on. I'm 5'3' and I wear a size 14 pants, but the 2-12 legging fits fine. I was afraid the next size would be too long. I love the variety of prints they offer and the wide range of solid colors too. I'll be buying from Leggings Depot from now on!"
"I loooovvvveeee these sandals!! Comfy, and easy to put on. Stays secure and the stretchy ankle part is a plus to me. Going to get these in other colors."
They're a pretty solid product. I bought these for skydiving. REPRESENT. You can totally see any colored underwear through it so be mindful or just do you. I do me.
What can you say about Levi's 550s? They pretty much fit awesome and feel great on. The only reason I'm not giving them a five-star is they don't manufacture their jeans in America.
Gorgeous classic watch!! I'm a woman who likes a bigger watch and this piece fits the bill!
"I am going to start this off with the negative, I ordered the charcoal color to go with a shirt I had ordered. Well, these arrive and they are nothing like the picture on the screen, they are way lighter than what you see on the listing and it ended up not even matching with the shirt I wanted to wear them with.

Even though I cannot wear them for what I wanted they are still comfortable and fit me nicely. I am short so I figured they would not fit me how they should but they surprisingly did and that made me really happy. It is weird how far the top comes up and makes me look weird if I am wearing a short shirt. When they are pulled up like they are supposed to be the top of the leggings literally go up to my boobs and makes my backside look rather long. Fixing that is no big deal just wear a shirt that will cover it up.

I am pleased with these even though I had some problems I would still recommend these to others, Just know that the color you order may not be the color you get. I will attach pictures to show the color differences.

I received these free in exchange for my honest review."
THEY ARE THE BEST I HAVE BROUGHT
Very disappointed when my favorite bra was discontinued but this is working well as a replacement. It fits well unlike most others I have tried and is very comfortable.
Too large to tie your hair up but excellent satiny fabric.
"Great crew neck shirts. They fit so well and it doesn't feel all loose, perfect fit"
"This is a beautifully designed bangle, the colors are so earthy and I love it !  It matches with most clothes and shoes.  Will definitely look for more Devon Leigh designs."
I am a F and my daughter is an F-G. I bought bras for both of us. My daughter was leery at first because it looked like a corset top type of bra and she thought it would be uncomfortable for long term wear. I talked her into trying it and she and I both agree it is marvelous not to have deep cutting marks on our shoulders because of the proper support of the garment. It does not have stays so there is no nasty rubbing on the sides and the fabric breaths such that I don't mind wearing it even in the height of the Arizona summer.  I will say it is easier to get this on with help but that minor complication is well worth the lack of pain and wires that dig into your flesh. Even better it keeps you from looking slumpy like some of the bras for larger cup sizes do. It lifts and separates instead of just mashing it all down or to the side.
They fit good and are amazingly comfortable considering they are high heel boots!  :)
Love Fly London!
"The Nautical swim suit is very light weight, comfortable and colorful.
I am very satisfied with this purchase."
"These are good quality shoe trees that adapt to the internal dimensions of the shoe.  The construction is solid and the cedar smell is very pleasant.  I have gotten into the habit of putting these into my shoes after a long day's work and they do indeed help my thinner leather shoes keep their shape.  They are also great for working with the shoes while polishing them.  The great thing about these particular trees is the adaptable toe for fitting into a variety of shoe styles, and the whole heel with handle for easy grip while using them or polishing your shoes.  If you have spent a lot of money on shoes and want to keep them fresh, then these are the go-to shoe trees.  Make sure you get the right size for the shoes they will be used with.  They should be firm in the shoe but not stretching out the leather but not too loose to make good contact with the leather.
UPDATE: Having now tried several brands of cedar shoe trees, I recommend these most highly due to the full heal construction, which puts even pressure across the heal and maintains the most natural shape.  Others with a smaller heal seem to distort the shape."
favorite for wet days. looks good with anything.
"I can't recommend these shoes enough.  I have moderately wide feet and even though the Echelon 5 currently does not come in a wide size, they fit like a dream.  At first I was hesitant to even try them on, because I am used to wearing a much slimmer looking old school sneaker, like an Onitsuke Tiger or an Asics and I usually will only wear something severe in a colour that is mostly black or charcoal.  Admittedly, I'm a sneaker snob and in the past have cared more about how the sneaker looked than whether or not it was most the comfortable choice for me!  I went to meet with a foot specialist who analyzed my gait in a very high tech way.  She filmed me walking on a treadmill barefoot and then again with many different sneakers.  Even though I initially refused to even try this shoe on as I kept telling her that the toe from above looked like a duck billed platypus, I eventually after much coaxing put it on my foot.  All I can say is WOW.  I felt like Cinderella finding her shoe.  It fit like a dream.  All my horrible foot aches have been significantly diminished now that I am wearing the right sneaker for me.  I had started to experience numb toes and quite a bit of pain in the ball of my foot.  I no longer have the numbness that I had from all my Nikes and the ball of the foot pain is a lot less.  I need to tell you what qualities I look for in a sneaker that are encompassed by this one.  I like sneakers that are light weight, breathable, comfortable and have a cushiony marshmallow-like feel.  (My feet are always hot, so I won't even try something on that has too much insulation.) This shoe has all of of those qualities and more since they actually look really great on and believe it or not, I've received many compliments on them.  I wish they came in other colours, but fortunately the current charcoal and pink combination is quite chic and I literally won't take it off my foot.  I have so many other sneakers, but I only want to wear this one now."
"I received such amazing compliments for this top at work! Free, float, loose and breathable, you'll ffel scandalous like you're hardly wearing a thing. The layers are great, and doesn't require any additional under layers. I'm definitely getting a different color!  Remember to size up for the flowy feel!

I'm 5'3, 160lbs,  and a large fit perfect. It's even a bit loose where it sits on the waist/hip."
Length is a little shorter than expected.
"This is a really cute shoe, but it is a tad bit snug.  If you are not wearing it on a daily basis to break it in when you do put it on it will take a minute for your foot to conform to the snugness.  I would suggest a size larger than you normally wear, but otherwise this is a great looking shoe.  I get lots of compliments when I wear it."
"Where do I begin about these awesome shoes. Yes I used the word awesome to describe these shoes and I'll tell you why. And if you're like me you'll understand why. All my life I've always have had issues with finding shoes that fit my foot properly overall. Many times I would find shoes that were long enough but not wide enough, or wide enough but not long enough, or to high of an arch and wide and the list goes on. I wear size 10 and I have what I describe as flat wide duck feet. So as a woman with above average big feet it is already difficult but when you add flat and wide to the equation it makes finding and fitting hiking shoes a true task and I'm lucky if they're cute and not bulky.
So I recently started a weight loss lifestyle change of trying to get healthy, so my friend suggested hiking. And another friend suggested the Salomon brand when I mentioned to him about wanting to go hiking, who was an avid hiker.
And after searching through colors and looks and reviews I settled on these shoes in a size 10.

PROS:
Comfortable
Supports foot
Roomy enough space to wiggle toes
Stylish
Great for hiking or climbing stairs
Last all day
Protect feet very well

CONS:
There are none silly, these shoes are amaze-balls

OVERALL:
This is a person who avoids wearing shoes just because they are so comfortable, but these shoes have change my mind, I went hiking, and conquer and survived going up 287 difficult stone stairs in these shoes, they provided the support I need and protected from feet, because there were  a couple of stairs I stubbed my foot on and didn't feel anything. These shoes were made for hiking not to mention the price is a steal compare to the store website."
"A pretty, flat sandal. I usually wear sports sandals and wanted something more feminine to go with broomstick skirts and capris.  These are perfect, casual but pretty. I got them in Vega green which goes well with jeans and most colors."
"Fits, cute style. Only bummer is the width is a bit tight. I have slight bunions so it does become a bit painful. Hoping it will loosen up awith some wear"
"This is great.
It looks like something Doris Day would have worn.
Since it is not warm enough to swim, I haven't worn it as a swim cap yet. Even if it doesn't keep my hair dry, I still think it's great.
I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review."
"Very cute! The shirt and dress is one piece -sewn together. Fits my 9 month old a little big, but that's to be expected. You will need tights and shoes for this outfit too, especially if you want to dress your baby in it in October."
"The sample that I received for review is very cute. It is made of sterling silver, with pearl. It was smaller than I thought it would be. It's the size of a nickel. Comes with chain."
"This material is medium thickness, decent quality."
NICE VEST.  GOOD FIT.
The most comfortable shoes Ive ever worn out the box.  And just as comfortable at the end of the day! The only thing is they get scuffed easily but I still love them.
Bought this as a Christmas gift. My father in law loved it.
These sandals look great on the foot and are super comfortable without looking like a comfort sandal!  They can really be dressed up or down and are so supportive.  The leather straps are super soft and there's nothing to rub or irritate the foot.  They have a stylish and expensive look.
"comfortable, supportive, fits my orthotics, rcvd quickly"
Husband loves it and gets many compliments from others!
It looks very nice. The material is not very soft actually little coarse. Its still nice as all sleepwear for kids is cartoon stuff so this change is welcome.
Perfect fit and so comfy!!! Beautiful wedges..Worth the price
Cute and perfect for spring!
"little small buy size up, two sizes if going to wear hooded sweatshirt under"
Have purchased this item once before.  Loved the then and love them now!
My husband had his first pair of carhartt bib overalls about 10 years ago.  He really likes them.  Bought two pair this time.  Amazon had them cheaper than most places.  Would definitely buy them again.
"I have high arches and have a difficult time finding comfortable shoes or sandals that I can wear all day.  I have a cleaning and errand business and I""m on the go and on my feet all day.  These sandals are versatile and seem to be durable also.  I've ordered other pairs of these sandals in the other colors they're available in because they're that comfortable."
Love these Chucks! They fit wonderfully. Look great and came promptly. No complaints! Thank you!
"I usually wear a B cup, but in this I wear a C cup.  THIS IS THE BEST BRA YOU WILL EVER BUY.  Material is absolutely heavenly.  So soft and smooth.  Very pretty bra. Super comfortable. I bought in every color except London Fog (they were sold out, wahh).  Buy this bra.  You won't regret it."
"I like that this poncho has snaps down each side and at the neck.  The poncho folds up and fits into a pocket that is affixed to the poncho.  There is a draw string closure for the pocket, with a toggle to secure the closure.  It can be folded into the pocket, air pushed out and it ends up about the size of my hand.  I wear a size small glove.  It easily slips into a backpack with very little added weight.  I am 5'2"", the length hits me at my knees. Mine had a good first time workout this past weekend.  It kept me dry, water was easy to shake off and after buying at least a dozen ponchos over the past ten years, looks like I have finally purchased a keeper."
"As it currently stands, this seems like a nice belt.  The buckle is nicely finished and the leather seems ok.  As with most other belts I have had, it will take some time to see if the leather is of superior quality.  I will update my review after 2-3 months."
Washes well and looks lovely.
Nice shiny bracelet
This bathing suit is adorable!  You need to buy a size up but the quality is good.
These shoes are great.  I highly recommend them for those working in a healthcare setting.  They make for fewer sore feet at the end of the day.  Worth the price.
"I have tried all types of diapers for my two year old and these are the only ones that don't leak. We are not potty training yet, but we still use these because they are the only ones that keep her dry."
"This shirt fits perfectly.  The arms are long enough, it has some shape, and it covers butt when I sit.  It is also sooooo soft.  It is nice and thick too.  It feels like it will hold up to lots of use.  The color is almost exactly as shown in the picture.  It might be just a tad darker."
This is a great product with lots of storage.  Saved me many time.
"This dress is gorgeous for the price. Looks like a Balmain knock off from the front, Back is a smooth fabric. Worth the price and great for many ages."
"I ordered these for my wife, who wears an 8 in every other shoe/boot I know her to own.  These were at least a half size too big, and unfortunately the next half size down was not available for exchange.  The shoes looked great and were her choice, but she had to change to the Nimbus 14's to get her size.  I knock one star only because they do not run true to size, but had I known that I would have been ok I guess."
Fit perfectly - grandson loves it - great fabric and color.
"I wear an XL in womens gloves and these lace gloves stretch to fit my hand and go just past my wrist.  If you have uber-long fingers you may have a problem as these run a tad short; if you're only wearing them for short periods, they'll be fine."
"I was about to give up  on finding a bra that offered support as in HOLDING the girls UP!  This bra is fantastic in that department, however, the straps DO fall down which I cannot tolerate so I will try wearing the strap in a halter style and see if that resolves the issue.  Very well made and very comfortable!"
"Love these boots, great purchase"
"Exactly as advertised. The stones and rose gold are beautiful and the size fits comfortably on the ear. They look really fancy but I wore them with jeans and a tank top and they were just the thing to make my outfit ""pop!"" I am a first time buyer with this vendor but I will be looking at more of their inventory to see what other goodies they have in stock."
Perfect for Harry Potter lovers!
These are the only socks my wife likes and they are not commonly available. I am excited to have a good source of supply
Suits fits as expected. Great color and style.
"Great dress...unreal value for price. I got the red in medium. I'm 5'6 and 148 lb's.  Fit well, got tons of compliments.  Sexy, but still a classic sophisticated look. Can't go wrong."
Awesome for cold weather. Rarely used here in Hawaii.
The only grease I will use on my work boots
"Got this for my daughter, she loves it and so does my husband! It is cute!"
Allow for one size shrinkage as always.
"CowCow has not let me down! I'm 5'9"" and their dresses are great length and fit!"
A++++++ great deal
This is by far the best of my collection.
"When i saw the bra i thought to myself.....""HHHmmmm this bra looks too big for me!"" but wen i tried it on it fit very well. I am accustomed to wearing Playtex bras....they fit very well."
"Not to be too specific but I can't remember the last time I bought a bra (especially without trying it on) I have been wearing shelf bra tops for years and as I am getting older I can see these are NOT helping in the support area. Even in the past (in my younger/thinner years) I had trouble finding a good fit. When I saw the photo with the straps  and bra cups almost to the armpit area I thought this might be for me. It is almost unbelievable how this fits. It feels comfortable and there is no side ""boob"" spillage on the sides.. I will send an update after wearing for a while. AND will be buying more! Again, I hate to store shop so I am more than pleased with this purchase and seller!!! Good job to all and Amazon has a good seller with you..I am very pleased all around.. Oh, even better I was able to use an Amazon gift card I got for my birthday..."
"The little flag pin is very attractive.  As a veteran, I will wear it proudly.  It is small yet large enough to receive attention."
"This robe is sooooo warm and cozy. The fit was a little large, but I really don't mind. Perfect for cold winter mornings!"
As advertised. Very cool.
Bought these for my husband for Christmas and he loves them!  They are not only super comfortable but are also warm without making his feet sweat like some slippers that have fleece lining. They are very nice looking and I should probably order an additional pair before the style is no longer available. Highly recommend this product.
Pretty but very small and only one size is offered.
Cute design. Has shoulder buttons for big-headed babies.
Satisfied customer
"They fit like a glove, super comfy, they are flat shoes don't expect arch support. Did not buy them for running, but as casual they are really nice and will go well with any jeans/joggers, kakkies, etc. Just bought another pair in other color both at a very good price. I am 7 1/2 and bought them in 7 1/2 and they are perfect. Thanks Amazon for the discount :)"
"It came on time. It looked like my hair as well. I need to take pictures and upload them, which I may do later. Worth the price but sheds a lot when you brush it."
Great quality hat. Fit as expected.
"I can fit my key fob, all my credit cards, a chap stick, money, receipts, and cell phone so nicely in this soft leather wallet - LOVE IT!"
Love love love ! Can't wait to wear them at my school's annual Alumni Weekend.
"Awesome and went well with the others I have...which, by the way, is the second one I have BOUGHT...I now have several and could have SAVED $ by buying through AMAZON...hoping for more too come..."
Love them.  Just reordered them to give to more friends!
"Arrive quick; love the design and color; can go with beige, brown and lavenders"
Small but beautiful stud earrings.
Great price on Prime Day.  These are one of the few socks that last for the guys.
"May be my fault that I am not happy.  One shoe was a bit smaller than the other but I didn't send it back.  I now wish I had.  I thought that the shoe would adjust to the mold of my foot, but it didn't.  Most people love their OTBT's.  One of mine fits the form of my foot perfectly, the other doesn't and drives me insane.  Other than that, they came on time so the company selling them on here shipped them properly.  So I gave it a 4 star."
"The shoes I ordered half size bigger since in sneakers I like a bit more toe room. The shoes are very comfortable. The first time I used them was on a nice long walk. They supported my arch, which is very important for me. The only drawback if any is that the back end is a bit high and it slightly rubbed against the back of my heel. The next time I wore them I did not have the problem, maybe it was due to the long walk. They are also very light, not heavy."
My husband washed it few times and the black didn't fade just yet. Size was rather small? It did shrink up a bit in the washer. Size up!
Comando baby
Another win for Pattyboutik. This fits true to size and is adorable.
One of the best Golf Shoes Made.
Nice looking swimsuit at a great price. This was a gift for my daughter and it fits her perfectly. Beautiful color and good quality.
"So excited to wear this on our upcoming star wars cruise!  It fits perfect, no too short or tight although I ordered a large."
works great under my sheer summer dresses...
It's the perfect size. Very unique and the quality is like no other. A very good buy!
"beautiful, shiney, and sturdy..i love it!"
These are really nice pants that look good and fit well at a price well below what you pay for dress trousers in big name men's stores.
"These pajamas were a Christmas present for my son and they are SO cute. They are a good quality and he loves there is a ""Choo-Choo' on them!"
"Soft, nice, a teensy bit small"
Nice bracelets to give to family to hope for a cure for cancer.
cost
"Very cute shirt. However, too small. Giving to a friend."
Has an awesome dsesign but it fits to tight.
"Nice fabric, awesome 2 sided cuff in black and ivory. I have a large 16 inch calf and these fit okay over tights or leggings."
Bought this set for my nephew. When he opened them he hugged them to himself. He was so pleased with them.
Great waterproof shoe. I've used it in the rain and it kept my feet dry.
My 2-year-old grandson wore these cleats when he dressed up as a soccer player for Halloween last year. He loved them.
I love this dress! I am 5'5 and 144 with bust at 34E. Ordered in XL. No pulling at bust as many button downs are. Maybe could get away with a large but the rest fit great. Many buttons but once they are buttoned you can leave it. Flows at skirt
This is one of my favorite items I have gotten from eVogue.  I like the longness of the cami.  The only issue I have with it is that the rhinestones are slowly coming off.
Nice shirt. Decent quality and fit. Will purchase more.
Adorable.  Good quality and just like the photo.
"I bought two of these - one in navy and one in purple.  Had to return the purple as it was too small, but the navy fit perfectly - same size.  It's a very good quality, and I'm happy that at least one of them fit."
I love these shoes.  They are very comfortable and I can wear them all day. I like dressing western and these are great when I don't wear boots. They go so well with my jeans.
"My husband has been searching for banded collar shirts for some time.  We have ordered more after receiving the first one.  My only comment is that I would have preferred exposed buttons and oxford cloth.  But at the price, these are a bargain indeed."
"I have a giant head, and this is a little snug, for normal headed folks it should be fine.  Peter Grimm hats are pretty flexible, not stiff like the Bullhide hats.  If you wet this you can mold and shape it without breaking the straw,  It looks pretty cool, like the pic."
"I mean- it is the comfy hanes jackets I loved as a kid.  They are warm, cozy and durable.  Holds up well in washing and drying on high heat.  It fit true to size.  I have this jacket in three colors I like it so much!"
"Love it, looks great and it was for a good price. The only thing that bothered me is setting the day and date was a pain. The hand illuminate only for a short time after being exposed to very bright light, which is fine I didn't buy it to see it in the dark. Comes with a nice pillow in the box that you can store it on when you're not using it."
Im very surprised at the fit 
"Great shoe. Outlasts any others I have ever had. Wouldn't have minded some color on the solid white, but they look clean and sharp with my uniform. Definitely try out the Hoka line. They are a treat for your feet."
"came with really cute accessories also!
extra heel tips
gel pads
heel liners also
however
i did experience a problem with the strap. the holes for it are way too loose. there were inches inbetween the strap & my ankle. Ended up punching new holes to make the strap fit. This then left the strap so long it was almost on the ground.
Held up great in an out door wedding in the fall, rain and mud."
I bought this for my grandson and he looks adorable in it.  Fits good and looks great.
"Great Delivery, great nice looking watch, big but not that big that overpowers your wrist. Pretty confortable, lot of funtions and feautures."
I got these for my daughter in law she really love them I didn't want to give them to her so I brought me a pair
"When you need a Bill Lumbergh costume, look no further.  Mmmmkay?"
This skirt is Awsome!!! It arrived real quick too. I am 5'7 155 lbs and this skirt fits like i a glove and material very nice and  too. Colors are nice too. BUT Very true to size!! I ordered L-XL.BUT IT IS A LITTLE SHORT ON ME BY I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH IT. AND IF IT IS TO SHORT YOU CAN ALWAYS WEAR WHITE LEGGINGS OR RED WHAT EVER YOU PERFER!!
"I recently had a minor fall in a pair of platforms with 3 inch heels, so No more heels that high. I like to pretend to be tall, but at 57 I have to give it up and admit that I am only 5'4"".  And, I really don't want any major problems, like broken hips.
These shoes though are great. They are comfortable and just enough heel to keep my jeans and pants from dragging the floor. They also look great with skirts and capris. As far as the fit, the shoes are wide enough to keep my toes comfortable and the support and comfort that Clark's Artisan provides is always great!"
"The watch looks good.  I was disappointed with the adjustment with the bracelet.  It caused several pins to break removing the adjustment pins.  Other than that, the watch keeps good time."
"I really like these jeans, they fit great and are very comfortable, they don't reveal your backside when bending over or squatting, yet they're lower cut, not mom-jeans.  The only reason i didn't give them 5 stars is because they're not black, certainly not volcanic black as advertised.  They're dark blue.  Still nice but I wanted black jeans. I""m going to try again with a pair labeled just 'black'.  I would buy these again, they're worth it."
This is soooo cute~!! I can just imagine a ton of girls wearing this during winter~ It would be too freakin' adorable~<3
nice comfy dress flats...
It's a nice watch.
The elegant rose hair band is a very cute head band. The rose are well made and put together. I let my 3 year old wear it because it suits her well. She handle it pretty rough but the head band is still in good shape. The rubber band is stretchable and it isn't super tight on the head. This head band is good for wedding or any occasions. There are 7 roses on the headband which occupies half of the the whole band. The roses is attached well on the band so even if you pull it it won't come off. I received this product for free in exchange of my honest and unbiased review.
"Everything is ok
Fit Medium/Large perfect for 5.58ft 128lb"
never knew my cc and passport were at risk.  you better get some.  these worked great.  thanks!
This is a very cute hat! Very fashionable! My daughter is so in to derby hats with her style. I was very pleased when I recieved this hat for my review that it is a very durable hat and stiff so it doesn't get smashed easily. It fit her perfectly and looks adorable with her scarves. I would recommend this hat to any fashion style lover.
cute jacket. well made. my daughter loves it.
"I'm on the heavier side, so I thought this wasn't going to fit. But it's very stretchy! I wore this to ultra music festival and I was comfortable the entire day! I was able to move and dance without feeling like this was too tight. I'm 170 36DDD and it fit me perfectly. If you are a size XS it would probably be somewhat loose. But who knows how the material changes when you wash this. The fabric is great, very soft and it's not see thru! Overall great price and great quality!"
Comfy and fair price so far still new though...
"I thought I'd look like a granny in this thing, but didn't care because I don't want sun on my face - but I look like an actress from the audrey hepburn era in it - LOVE IT.  and I love the way it un-does with velcro so I can hang it on beach bag handles, hooks, etc - I can't do that with my straw visor."
"I get lots of compliments. Pretty. Matches with almost everything, amazingly."
"The quality is as you expect with UGG, the material both the outside and inside is soft, the inside is unbelievably soft. These are not for summer however, as they are real thick, really comfortable, and warm."
They look size and fit correctly. It's a nice basic boardshort. The color is as pictured and they look nice.
Pant fit well for pette and comfortable
"Lovely light purple, almost tanzanite in shade.  Love the extender with the gems.  Seems to be very well made."
I love it fits big but was what I wanted
"Great panels,thanks"
"Nice and soft, and soooo cute!"
I bought these shoes to wear while kayaking. When launching your kayak you sometimes have to step into some rocky terrain and so I wanted a shoe that that was closed toe and durable - yet could go into water and dry quickly. I also needed something that was comfortable enough to hike in when I got to my destination. This shoe is a great fit for all my needs! The only downfall is that the leather that stretches across my toes seems to dig in after a while. They may just need more breaking in - but overall I'm happy!
"If you're a frequent traveler, or a ""must do it all in a carry-on"" traveler, these are a must. They go beyond just organizing your suitcase, they actually compress the contents so you can fit even more in it. I own a Tumi International Carry-On Hardside and these fit perfectly in there - one big one + the long skinny one on one side, one big one + the two smaller ones on another. Here's what I am able to fit in each.

Small Square 1:
- Full weeks worth of undergarments + a pair of pajamas (rolled)

Small Square 2:
- Bag of chargers
- Mini first aid bag (a few bandaids, aspirin, vitamins)
- Travel candle (makes hotel living slightly more appealing)

Skinny Rectangle:
- 1 pair of heels + 1 pair of flats (stacked on top of each other)

Large 1:
- 3 pairs of pants
- 1 blazer
- 1 sweater
- 1 gym outfit

Large 2:
- 5-7 tops of varying weights / thicknesses
- scarf
- small jewelry roll + clutch

In a carryon!!! I've utilized the old version of the eBags packing cubes in the past and enjoyed them but the sizes of these are a much better fit for the suitcase and seem to compress more. I highly recommend them!"
"Exactly what i was lolking for, not too heavy or thick."
I like these sunglasses.  I think they fit me well and the bifocal part is a good fit for me.  I choose them to wear over another pair I have.
I have a hard time finding comfortable shoes that are still sexy and this shoe delivers! So much so that I ordered another pair in a different color!
"My wife is a bigger girl and it wasn't too small for her, she was estatic with it, loogs good to"
Wore it for my sons graduation.  I received so many compliments on this dress.  Bought a black belt to use instead of the one that came with it.
I love these boots! They fit perfectly and are surprisingly comfortable
These are made extremely well and are really nice looking.
"Great price
Comfortable supportive shoe and I'm 330 pounds"
No complaints! Have worn and washed several times. Fits wonderfully. 100pounds and ordered a small.
Comfy and snug but a little large. My boyfriend is slim and a size medium. Medium was pretty big.
Sturdy and a good size for a five year old. My grandson is very happy with it.
"These are very nice pants, just wish the pockets had zippers to keep the snow out"
"Loved the color of this bra and the softness, BUT I just wish it had some true padding. When it says light weight, they mean it. It certainly lives up to its description, but I've got itty bitties and I need a good push."
"relaxed fit, loose enough for exercise and yoga. I like the pockets!"
got these for my daughter and they are absolutely darling!  i had to exchange for a size up though.... i think the brand must run a bit small as i had to do the same for a pair of saucony's for myself.  EASY to exchange and the new shoes fit perfectly.
"These are perfect quality, its just like I bought them at the store. They came faster than expected and fit perfectly but if they didn't that would be my fault. Have a nice day everyone!"
"I bought my first pair of asics a few weeks ago and loved them, so came back to Amazon looking for a deal on similar.  Found this pair ""4E"" shoes on deep discount. I know I have wide feet, but I was skeptical about the 4E being too wide.  So I read up what Asics had to say about it, which was that the actual width may only vary by a milimeter or a few.  When I got these, I compared them to the ""normal"" pair I already had, and holding them tread to tread against each other, I could not see that the 4E was any wider at all.

For me this was great news because I wasn't really looking for a lot wider. So the information to share is this .. the ""wide"" actually comes more in the form of the cloth-like materials above the tread base.  I have very high arches, and on the ""normal"" shoes, the tongue bulges out and laces look liek they are covering a big gap.  On these 4E shoes, the shoes look normal, like they fit!  I now feel educated about what wide really means ... I will definitely be back for more!"

She will love them."
"These shoes are used for my water aerobics. They are very comfortable, seem well constructed, but are not to be considered orthopedic shoes-(little or no arch support.)"
Beautiful wrap. I wore this over a black dress and got a bunch of compliments. The only complaint is that this snags very easily.
Great support and very comfortable but I felt that they run a little large.
I gets lots of compliments on this.  Very pretty and well made.
"My grand daughter was happy to get it, she is more comfortable now.  Thank you."

Needed a dress for Friday Night Wedding, Ordered it in Wine and Navy.  Navy I chose, looked very nice and fit perfectly and I loved the look and it was extremely comfortable to have on which made all the difference in the world.  I felt good in this dress!!"
Runs a little large but my 6 year old still loves. Super soft. And the price was very good
"great for back,holds in place,a size higher ,to be on the safe side"
"This product is fine, but the fit is just a little weird. My first instinct was to buy a medium but then I read reviews that said to by an XXL if you're a medium, so I did. The waist is still very snug, whereas the bib and legs are very loose.  I've never bought overalls before so this may be normal but I wish some parts of if weren't baggy."
This is a very cute sandal and fits extremely well!!  I have always had great success with the FitFlop brand!!
"Rather expensive, they may be a little large I really can't tell for sure, Extremely comfortable but they did ride up a little with all day wear."
My 6 yr old son loves them.
"Super cute.  Calf a bit narrow, would like wider."
My husband  just love this ring
Loved these shoes!  They were so awesome at the beach!!!  A great value as well!!!
"This is my 2nd pair of 890v4's, and am very happy with the shoe. They are exactly what I am looking for in a shoe -cushioning and light weight. It is my go to trainer as I prepare for my next marathon."
Cute little pull on slippers that I wear around the house.  You could also wear outside because of the nice sole.
"It's decent
I didn't expect it to be great quality so I'm not disappointed. It works just fine. No complaints."
Nice! Would go up a 1/2 size.
"These are comfortable cotton blend pants.  If you are looking for something with spandex to help hold your figure, these are not for you.  They show every curve.  They are not tight and don't cling to you.  They are 57/37% cotton/polyester and only 6% spandex.  They work well for my needs - working out and dance class."
Very happy with this very comfortable set of sleepwear.  Would buy again and again.
"Very comfy and toasty.  Great for dog walking or city walking.
Have a feeling they will be good for one season only."
Beautiful watch - heavy and nice large face - great value!!
"Just got my 6th pair... i wear them all day every day. I've tried so many other brands but they all end up ripping and getting stretched out as the day goes on. hue leggings are sooo comfy. not too thick, not too thin, soft cotton, fits like a glove and stays like that no matter how much you move around in them during the day and they never get worn out. Color does not fade away no matter how many times I wash and dry them. They are AWESOME and I will definitely keep on buying hue legging only. These are the best leggings around. You will not regret buying these :)"
"This was too big and a little frumpy on me. I didn't like the material, it was really thick and stretchy.. again, felt really frumpy."
"Excellent item.  It really is very comfortable.  Be advised to air dry not put in dryer after washing.  Otherwise, a perfect buy for someone who is looking for comfortable socks if you have ""toe"" issues.  Keeps your toes warm and cozy."
"It's a really nice leather wallet.  It has a lot of capacity. 7 credit card slots and a removable ID card case.  It is a bit thick though, which is understandable due to it's large capacity.  The leather is smooth and the stitching seems well made.  It's definitely a nice wallet, especially for the price.  I honestly was not expecting something this nice  I have purchased other wallets for more money, and this is just as nice as the expensive wallets.
***Update** My husband does tend to pack his wallets tightly, but his wallets usually last a year or more.  This wallet seems to have started to come apart a bit at the bottom.  Not bad, but almost like there was a small portion where the stitch was missing or is coming off.

I received a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
"Dress arrived on time, as promised , and it's gorgeous! I love the material - very soft and heavy, so it falls nicely, hugs curves, and is not completely see through. These run a bit large, but I expected this from other reviews, so order mindfully. I am 5'6"" 125 with a slim build and the small is just right. Even at my height, though, it is long and touches the ground, so if you're any shorter be prepared to have this dress tailored or get some sweet matching heels. I think it's totally worth it, though, as this dress feels like a 100 dollar dress rather than less than half the price I paid for it. Thanks PattyB, for yet another win!"
"My boyfriend absolutely LOVES this ring. The design is so awesome and intricate. I gave it 4 stars because it's not exactly scratch resistant.. My boyfriend scraped it really bad after the first time going to the gym and picking up weights so as a result, he takes his ring off every time he's at the gym. Also, go half a size smaller than you expect. The overly smooth surface makes it really easy to slip off when in contact with water. It's pretty inconvenient that not only does my boyfriend have to take it off at the gym, but now also when he washes his hands or takes a shower just so he doesn't lose it. He doesn't complain though and says he wants his wedding ring to be modeled after this exact ring. He's happy; that's what counts most I suppose."
Nice bracelet bought it for my grandson for Christmas it looks very nice and very well packed and I very much like the colors
"Lightweiight, wicking, ventilated and dries quickly. Happy with these shirts. Wish the crew collar was a little higher."
"This dress fits great and looks good.  It's very comfortable and the length is just below kneecap on my 5'3"" frame."
"Fit perfect, tight enough I can use my fingers, very warm and I live in Wisconsin."
LOOOOVE IT
"My boyfriend has hard to fit feet and he loves these!! He walks all day on concrete and barely sits down. Thank you for fast delivery, a great product and A QUIET BOYFRIEND!!! lol he cant complain now....."
Cute. Get it. Comfy cute....u will love it.
"I work 12+ hour shifts in a hospital and Danskos are the only clogs I can wear and not have sore feet and back at the end of my shift. When I saw the great price offered on these, I bought three pairs!"
Perfect for my husband. He likes them.
"I love these shirts. I'm small and usually shop petites or kids' sizes. The XS fits me as shown on the model. I like the loose fit with the funky pattern - I have the black and white as well. The material is excellent - lightweight, silky, no ironing, no folding collar! A modern classic & perfect for summer."
sister loved this
It is larger than I expected (before you buy I'd recommend taking a tape measure and really looking at the dimensions)...but looks great. Has held up well so far.
Good bandanas
"Excellent quality.  Will need to break them in as they are somewhat narrow, but should loosen with continued wear."
"I'm glad I ordered these scrubs from Dagacci Medical Uniform, they fit well and the most I like is the top and the bottom material are the same, same color! Some companies are making different colors and don't match: remember that! There're tons of pockets are convenient when I'm working. Love the material which is not the best but acceptable with the reasonable prices.
I definitely come back to order again! Thank you Dagacci."
"thank you, this is great product, size was perfect"
"Nice and light weight, not lined but good fit."
I got so many compliments on my pics with my granddaughter. I thought the costume fit great and was pleasantly surprised that the collar stayed up like in the cartoon. Absolutely loved it
this bra fits true to size '34b' and it is comfortable and also provides a nice push up with out having to much padding.
"These are the most comfortable because of the 56% cotton, but they don't shrink because of the polyester blend. I wear a size 10-12 & buy a large. You can put them in the dryer too. I have 4 pair. No wonder their ratings are so high. They're thinner material than the high spandex percent ones, making them perfect for summer. Feels like a t-shirt hugging your bottoms. ;-)"
"Super cute, although fits small, I will have to give it to my sister"
"I am a six foot tall skinny woman who can never find anything that has long enough sleeves. I am oddly lanky, so I went with the men's cut for the length, and I am so very glad I did! This jacket is everything I hoped it could be, and more! It is perfectly warm, it does a good job in the wind, and though it does hang off me a bit, the length more than makes up for that! It is surprisingly soft, and it is a lot like have a warm blanket that is cuddling you while you wear it, but light and warm. The pockets are lined too, so it is great to keep your hands warm, or you can just pull your hands into the sleeves. It may be a men's cut jacket, and I am sure it is not that flattering if I were to zip it up, but it does what I wanted it to do most of all, keep me warm at work, where it is cold, windy, and sometimes a bit wet. Nonetheless, it is my go to jacket for work now, and surprisingly, I have even gotten a few compliments on it!"
Nice fit I usually take 1x this is xLg  the quality is worth the price
"The earrings are beautiful. They look really shiny and classy. There is one down side though, the thin attachment part where goes into the ear is very thin. I almost bent it the first time I was putting it on my ear. Other than that, all is good."
Absolutely one of the best dresses I have ever purchased.  Incredibly flattering for one who has a larger midriff area.  Sleeves are classic and dress is a lovely material.  Highly recommend!
"It's nice - what I expected, I will get a lot of use from this hat"
"Very light weight, the inside sole is a bit thin, over time may need another insole to add more comfort so you aren't pounding the ground. These are not hot or bulky"
"He loved this watch. Simple and elegant looking. He needed a suit watch. He has always liked his Citizen watch, and wanted a new one. This was a Christmas surprise. Very satisfied!"
"I bought this pack of 4 cooling bandanas because of sensitivity to heat. Immersed  in cold water for 10 to 30 minutes, the beads inside inflate and create a necklace of relief. After drying off the bandana with a towel, wear it around your neck. The material is thin enough to work well, but eventually body heat will warm up the necklace, so turn it over. I don't recommend refrigerating or freezing these or any of these types of cooling agents (the kind wrapped in material). They tend to feel slimy after beng refrigerated re condensation, maybe. Freezing would probably make them inflexible. I have MS and have been using products like these for decades. I recommend these."
"The colors are so vivid. The length is a little short for me, I like my dress below my knees. I am 5'4"" and 165 lbs. I got a size 12 it fit me just right just don't like the length. The material is not flimsy. Not too thick and definitely not thin like some dresses."
They are adorable and very absorbent. Highly recommend these.
"Bought for my Dad to hang around the house in the winter, and he loves it."
"Great spring jacket!  Well made and fits well.  I wear a 3X shirt and ordered a 4X jacket, great fit."
"They are a perfect fit for my son who is 6'3"". Great pants especially for the price!"
"I never realized how cute crocs were till I started buying their flats/sandals. These sandals are both cute and and comfortable. I could wear them out casually or even with a more dressy outfit.
They are just a tiny bit big on me, but not enough to make them uncomfortable or slip off. It's actually kind of nice that their a teeny bit big because my heal doesn't rub up against the back.
I was most worried about the straps being too rough or cutting up my feet, but the rubber is flexible and soft.
Definitely going to buy these again when the time comes!!"
Plan to give this shirt as part of a Christmas gift.  It is nice and thick and looks durable.
"Fit as expected.  I'm 5'1"" and 115 pounds and it fit.  Everyone thought it was cute.  Good deal for the price."
"Purchased this for my Mother and it fits her well.  Attractive pattern and nice, soft fabric.  Can be used with both a casual as well as more formal attire."
Very comfortable.  Love the 100% cotton.
"They are ok. Too much stretchiness in them but if only wearing a few hours, they work alright."
"This is a shoe my physiotherapist recommended following my knee replacement , because of its Constuction , I didn't expect it would look good too ."
"Quality seems great. Style and features are top notch. Does scratch really easy but I suppose that only matters when you're meeting an old flame in Belize for the weekend and you see her cast a disapproving look at your scuffed up luggage. But really, who cares what she thinks? It sucked losing her but things have changed over the years. Now YOU are the prize in this relationship, not her! In fact she and her controlling family can just...
Oh, sorry. The luggage is great."
"Bought this during an amazon flash sale for something like $8 i believe.  They fit like walmart shirts, meaning if you aren't overweight, they will be way too big around the waste and arms.  Got this tailored and took off the pocket and they look great.  Good material, just fits too big."
This ring is awesome. It looks and fits as described. My husband gets lots of comments and compliments on it!
"Beautiful, high quality appearance.  True to size.  Delighted with purchase and would buy again.  THANKS!"
"The shoes fit me a little big, I like them a lot, it is very comfortable."
Good quality and versatile...would buy again.
"I just received them today so I can't really say how comfortable they are.  In trying them on, they seem like they will be.  The upper is pretty stiff.  I am hoping they will break in for me!"
"I cannot wait to give this wonderful locket to my Mother for Mothers Day. She is so special to me, and she deserves the world. She is also the best grandma to my step kids.

Excellent -
If you have big eyes the ladies mask is better glued onto a stick. I painted a plastic chopstick with black nail polish and hot glued it on and it worked fine and everyone complimented me on it. The guys mask was perfect!
Love the shoe. Very well made. It does run small. My daughter wears a 4 in all her shoes but this type she would have needed a 5.
"Ok, so I have odd feet: wide in front, very narrow in back, R a whole size bigger than L.  Looking for shoes that did not look like 'sneakers'; since that is all my feet can tolerate-I need a R toe fusion at this point and have an arch issue on that side. So sneakers have been my only option. Any shoes I can find; I walk right out of with my very narrow heels; or they crunch my toes! This shoe: very surprised! So light, not much arch support looking at them out of the box!  Put them on my feet: did not walk out of them, they are cushy; but not as much as expected; but that's ok! I have finally found a more 'moc' looking-sneaker type shoe that actually looks 'girly'! Thank goodness for this shoe! I had ordered the 9's first; because that is what my R foot now is; but the 9's were too big; went with the 8.5's! I am so happy, I now have a sneaker that looks more like a cute shoe! Highly recommend this style of sneaker-shoe!  I also have the white cloth-type; I don't like the real bright colors. My husband says the white look like a nursing shoe; but I ignore that! Only issue I have with this shoe is that I got them to wear barefoot; and my feet do sweat a bit wearing them around the house. I have worn these on my treadmill; I am extremely surprised; with how light they are; that my feet feel better in these than my $140 Asics; which make my R foot hurt at the end of a workout! These are amazing!"
Husband happy.
"Super cute shoes and a great price! I've gotten so many compliments on them. I bought my size and they do seem to run a little big length wise, but great for wide feet."
This product was as advertised. Very nice and well worth the price. I would order these handkerchiefs again when needed.
Loving my new purchase!
"As other reviewers have said, this skirt is super sheer. The color is even prettier in person though! Perfect for spring and summer. I am going to wear it to work."
These sweatpants are very comfortable.  I recommend them highly.
Arrived as a brand new item.  I am normally an XS but the short fit just right.  Glasses are fun and hat fit as well.
"super strong magnet, does not demagnetize my credit cards or hotel room key so absolutely worth it"
All good fits good
Really love the style. A little hard to put on in a hurry. Very cool and unique
"Great price, love this wallet."
Ordered these to go with a dress I have for family pictures. Fits right to my normal size and looked great with what I was wearing.
"The product is unique. Its smell and texture make it pleasant to use. I apply it with just my finger. It does wonderful things for my cowhide wallet. It softens the leather and after a few applications, it produces a deep gloss finish."
"Bought these for work, there Great!! they are long just past my knee's. But im 6'2 so it works well with me."
"Very comfortable silicone ring. I got this for my son because he's a construction worker. Well, I gave it to his wife to give to him. My son absolutely likes this ring a lot. This is his work ring, he calls it. He says that he doesn't even feel like he has a ring on when he's working. It's very lightweight and fits perfect on his finger. He's a size 9 and that's what I ordered and it fits him just right. He likes the design, it's simple, perfect for a man. My son never did like those fancy type of rings, so this ring fits his style. This ring came nicely packaged in a box, you could gift it right away. This makes a great work ring or for any very active man, great backup ring! I have received this item for free for my complete and honest review."
leathr is soooooooo soft and beautiful.  Used it right out of the box love it. love love it it it
"I've been looking for a fun heel with Blue Patent for a while and this show jumped right out at me.  They were waiting on my doorstep when I got home from work and I ran in to try them on, perfect fit, and super cute.  They are reasonably priced, and I've had good luck with Pleaser shoes in the past so I'm a happy camper!"
"I love this blouse. It could be worn as a dress too, maybe with laced up sandals. Versatile."
Always wonderful
This is a very elegant piece of jewelry and looks great on my Sterling Silver Chain.
"Love Gold Toe. These are great thin dress socks for dress shoes. Thicker than nylons, but thin enough for fitting shoes."
I have purchased Skechers for three years.  They fit my feet perfectly....I have a high arch.  Very comfortable shoes for walking.
"The shoe is beautiful, was smaller than expected, comparing to other brands. You can see that the quality is not a $200 shoes' one but it is very decent for its price. I hope to get it in the right size and start enjoying it."
"These leggings are so awesome! They fit great, I cant wait to wear them to dance class lol should be fun. They look so cool"
I love the new strap for my switchflops. I have a new look when I want to change it up. Everyone thinks I lots of sandals.
Great Fits perfectly great quality
Very comfortable I really like the design but kind of shorter than an usual 30
"the best running shoe i ever had.
when the shoe fits etc'"
"My mom loves these boots, her feet are never wet. They keep the foot very warm, nomore cold winter feet"
"Absolutely  LOVE these shoes! They looked so cute in the pictures and I was hoping they'd be as nice as the other reviews made then out to be. Well, they are! The heel is the perfect size, abs I haven't gotten to wear them out yet but they seem really comfortable. I ordered 2 other colors."
Great little 3 piece outfit for your little one. Well made and good price.
Looking forward to wearing this comfy boot all winter!
"This slip is beautiful and really nice quality. I am 5'7"" though, so I am going to order the longer one in the future. It just depends on how much coverage you're looking for. I like the slip to be a little past my knee and this one comes to about the top of my knee. I usually wear plus size, but the XL slip fit fine. It's nice and stretchy and I like how it's not restraining at all. It's very comfortable. I would recommend this product and will be ordering more of these slips in the future."
"Looked for these all over, one of the best uniform shirts I have found,  When you order get  a size smaller than you buy at the
cheap mall stores. Length was great and the neck when buttoned doesn't choke you. I am 5'9"" 175 lbs and waist 34"".  The medium fit
very well. If you wear a vest on duty you will need a large. I like the front zippered pockets."
"They fit just as they should, I can easily wear them all day which I actually do. I would not say that they support the arch, to me I find they are a bit like I was walking bare feet but like on a cushion. They are great and I ordered some more but in different colours."
"Loved this dress, I originally brought it for my Godsons graduation but when the date was changed I decided to wear something else & saved this for my cruise, when we had our all black night, got tons of compliments."
Great Product Beautiful
I bought these for my son about two years ago and expected them to brake during the year and buy new ones next year. Well their going on their third year in great shape even through both my Daughter and Wife using them to run outside and they have bigger feet then my son. I will defiantly be buying new ones this year because his feet out grew them. I post a picture to show the wear after three years. He wears them all the time except in the snow of course.
"Love this bag!!!  Looks like a Brahmin bag at a fraction of the price.  The color is a fabulous , perfect deep red (not maroon red), craftsmanship is top notch, size is just right and overall it exceeded my expectation.  Knowing that it was so much cheaper than a Brahmin I expected it so be lacking is some minor ways but took a chance on it anyway because of the price and I was very pleasantly surprised.  It easily holds all my things, is not too heavy, comes with a shoulder strap that is long enough to use as cross-body and it is very eye-catching.  I will definitely order the other colors available and hope that the vendor comes out with even more colors of this fabulous bag!"
I love this coat! Looks great and is warm without being too hot.
it was my something blue on my wedding day. Love it
"Excellent pocket t-shirts.  Nice fit.  Bought six, Im ordering six more now,"
"Love these shoes. They look like real shoes with laces and all. The cleats are recessed so that you can walk on them very comfortably. The cleat rubs a tiny bit when you walk, but not enough to impede movement appreciably. I would not recommend walking on them indoors on hardwood or anything, but for outside, they're very functional. They look good and fit well. I much prefer these over typical velcro-style moonboot cycling shoes!"
I love these shoes-wear them so much i have three pair!!
Nice colors and convenient way to purchase panties.
"Great comfort, warm, and fits well."
"I ordered this top in burgundy and the color looks just like it does in the picture. I'm 5'1, 105 lbs, and the small small fits great. It's loose-fitting (but not baggy) and it naturally slides off one should when I wear it, which I think makes it look subtly sexy. Great buy."
"Hopefully these will last as long as my other Levi shorts. These are pretty much straight leg shorts and a little lower rise than my Levi Workforce Cargo's, but look to be the same great quality. Just be aware, like my other ones, the sizing gives a little extra wiggle room. I usually wear 33w but these 32w fit great once worn in."
"So far I'm very pleased with it, it seems to slip less than other D rings.  I use it on work carharrts"
Love these house slippers. Sturdy. Comfy. Warm. Functional & nice looking.
"This bag has been great. I've used it for 3 months and not had any issue with the zipper or seams. It is very easy to fold back up and zip into the tiny pouch. I bought it for traveling and for impromptu overnights--it became my de facto pool bag. I haven't weighed it, but all zipped up the added weight to my suitcase was negligible. Also the pink color grew on me. Rich and just a touch obnoxious, it is easy to keep your eye on, which is what I wanted."
"This costume is totally worth what I paid for it.  However, it's VERY cheap quality.  The boots are basically vinyl spats that cover your shoes.  The straps broke almost immediately, though and I had to staple it back together.  The shirt and pants are really thin synthetic material and not very cute.  I wore the accessories with a different pair of pants and hoodie.  Overall, thought this costume got lots of compliments once I doctored it up a bit."
"My young teenage daughter flies out of some pretty busy airports and needed a good, sturdy, easy-to-wheel carry on. I got her this one in cranberry so that she could distinguish it easily from other peoples' bags, and because once I had gotten myself a spinner bag I realized they really are easier to work with in the airport. She loves it, and has had a couple of good flight experiences with it. It's lightweight enough that she can lift it to the overhead bin herself, but it does seem sturdier than previous bags she's owned."
"Great fit. Packaged right! Tags all intact. Hubby said,"" I love the fit & can tell its not a cheap hat"". I will be wearing it to. Lol"
"I am in love.  Jcrew has duck boots (they are always out of stock), Lands end has a pair.  They are all over $100.  I wasn't expecting much with these boots for the price, so you can imagine my delight when they arrived and they were so awesome.  Would definitely recommend."
"These are very pretty! There is a slight hint of bluish color, but not as bright as they are shown here. It's ok though, they are well made and I love them!!"
"Shipped quickly, came in a sealed bag. Very soft material. Bought the XL for my 6'2"" husband. Fits great. Pretty much just cozy pjs that we will be using as our Halloween costumes this year. Have not washed it yet, but I expect some shrinkage and wrinkles."
These are my everyday shoes that I wear for a 12 hour shift.  Very comfy and I love the color.  Planning on buying another pair in purple.
"Thanks to all of you who posted your thoughts about this bra. I tried one. It's so amazing that I ordered two more. Last night, I lay down to sleep and suddenly realized that I'd forgotten to remove my bra. Now THAT has NEVER happened before with any other bra. It is so comfortable."
"Good boot for the price. We got a smaller size than ordered, but it was OK because he still fit the smaller size."
good ol hybrid shorts
"I have used it for a couple weeks now and love it. I went to Nordstrom to get sized and bought it through here because it that time it was such a great price. I'm in love with it! It fits comfortably. My cup size is a F and it can be difficult trying to find things that fit and hold in well, everything stays in place. I would totally recommend it to anyone."
Exquisite! This ring is far better in person than it is in the picture.
My daughter is a huge Dr. Who fan and this cardigan is really cute!
This is the second time I have purchased this hat. I love it because my son loses hats often. So I don't have a lot of out of pocket expense to keep his head warm.  It is also stylish.  I would buy again.
Great item. Delivery on time.
"Adorable and worth the price, but are more for cuteness, not everyday wear. They're tighter, like the old fashion nylons women wore back in the day and don't allow your feet to breathe..."
"These shoes are really cute and comfortable.  My feet are wide, but the 9B is a good fit.  Am not sure if Jambu is part of J-41 (which I love for comfort and style), but it is similar styling and fit.  I wish they were a bit paler in color, but the online photo is accurate."
"A great hat !! Fits perfectly, very well made, nice wool, excellent proportions. I like that it has an adjustment cord. I will buy more from SIGGI"
"I got these as a replacement for my other black shirts. They are a bit thick, and you have to dry them a couple of times to get a decent fit. They take on the shape of the hanger you put them on, so sometimes you end up with bumps on the shoulders."
I like these leggings but I had to give them to my sister because they run very small. They are pretty though.
Fits as expected and coloring is good.
"They are cute, comfy and all black; which was a dertermining factor in my purchasing them. Many I saw had a different color sole, and I wasn't digging them. These are perfect and durable. I wear them a couple times a month and they are holding up great. Mind you, I am not a dainty delecate perosn, and these have managed to keep up. I would highly reccomend purchasing."
"These are so sexy, sleek,and comfortable. The material is lightweight so it's cool."
Excellent... heavy material Good Quality...
Fantastic.  Can wear with everything.  Very comfortable.
love the shoes. they are just what I wanted. got the navy. yes I would recommend these shoes . price was great too Thanks Amazon.
"I bought this Pea coat for the upcoming Winter since its expected to be very cold. Luckily is came in just in time for the 30 degree weather to get here. I love how durable this jacket is, and although you cant remove the Bib, it is a great feature for keeping your neck warm. Just in case your worried about size I am 6'0 240 lbs and I ordered a XL and it fits great. I have large Biceps and triceps and this still allows me a little room to grow."
"It is well built, and the best girdle I own. The others are both from Walmart though, and have eye and hook closures, which tend to come apart on stretched material. It compresses, and offers a smooth shape. I am 5'2"" 185 pounds and bought the medium, not because I am a medium, but because I want to be a medium. I am actually a size large, down from a size 2X last year. It did not make me a medium (if it did I would give it 10 billion stars). I tried on my size large Halloween costume without this on last night and with it on tonight, and really don't see a difference. I think because my stomach hangs a bit normally, and this pushes it up, and thus out, there just isn't a benefit to my profile while wearing it. I like the compression, but in my case with my body type there is no benefit to my profile while wearing this. Well made for what it is. Was difficult to put on, but then again I should really be in the large or even extra large size."
Nike stopped making this version and now I'm forced to buy them off amazon as the color choices get more and more ridiculous
"Early Christmas present for my granddaughter, she just loves them.  I like the bottoms of these boots, they are rubber so she won't slip on the snow and ice.  I have bought this brand before and this is the fourth pair of boots that I have bought for my grandkids.  I get them every Christmas, the Girls are shoe crazy, and I'm the cool grandma :)"
I not bad at all.
I love this bootsit`s comfortable and adorable.
Great quality. Extremely well constructed. Reinforced in all the right areas. Gold Toe products have lasted a reasonable amount of time for me in the past. Highly recommend Gold Toe products.
"While everynewborn is different, these little booties will fit most quite well. The are stretchy ans so soft . My friend was so excited about them since the weather here has bee quite cold."
This shoe is slightly larger size. But that's okay. I bought a size 7 for my daughter in her leg when ruchkory circle on a sheet of paper 14 cm Size 7 has enough space to put a sock.
"I love these shirts!  I wear them to work as well as more casually with jeans and they work great for each.  Nice and relaxed fit without being too boxy, and the sleeves (which I was afraid might be too 'blousy'/'peasanty') look good.  The only complaint I have is that the material tends to snag on my side where it rubs against my purse and tote bag, but unfortunately that seems to happen with every shirt I have of this type of material regardless of manufacturer."
"Wow, this is a lovely versatile bangle for the price. Sturdy, oval ergonomic shape. I was afraid it would be flimsy, but it isn't. This will get a lot of wear from me."
"Very soft ! Fit is a bit on smaller side. I'm 5'7 and 155 pounds and based on others , I got the ex large. Fits like a large. A lot if reviews said they received with a hole. Im not sure if they saw all those reviews and fixed issue; but all the seams seem very strong. I checked every inch. I haven't washed yet so I'm not sure if I will have issue  but for now I love them ! Very comfy and seems well made. I will update review if anything changes. They are very long but for hanging at home that's no issue for me."
I have always loved brooks
"Such pretty pearls for little girls. Great price too. I ordered about 5 pr. Some came unmatched, but
I was able to swap around."
I like this piece
So comfortable. I'm tall and the they are still slightly long which is perfect for me. Highly recommend.
I love this pushes so much

"So adorable! Great quality dress, but I never got the hair ribbon - I made my own since I needed it for Halloween and it came in days before. It really is a very nice quality - my 4yo fits into the next size up with a little room to grow"
"It is a very pretty watch, a little shiny but not really.  For the price it is great!!  Beautiful pearl face surrounded by crystals.  Light weight, face is not huge nor is it so small that you can't see it.  Perfect size.  I had two links taken out of bracelet band and it fits perfect."
"This one is 100 percent adjustable!!! I adjusted it 4 times as I kept losing weight after baby. So comfy and modest if pumping in front of family. Get this one!!! Medela only makes small, medium and large, and they are not adjustable like this one!"
Very well made but the the area at the top of the ankle cut into the ankle making it rather uncomfortable.
"I bought this for my 15yr son who tends to lean toward gray and blue.  I was pleasantly surprised by the ""raspberry"" color which isn't too red or pink, but somewhere in the middle.  It fit my son exactly as the picture shows and he was thrilled by the ""Hurley"" name and that Dad could be cool enough to pick it out.  Nice product.  Probably not the cheapest online, but far cheaper than their overpriced store."
"Sooooo cute!! Love these and comfortable.  The zipper in the back does not rub, sweet!  I have fat feet yes fat not wide but fat so I buy a 6 really could wear a 5.5 if the feet weren't fat lol.  My feet don't slide which is good since they maybe a tad long.  No complaints going to get the blue pair also."
I was waiting to have a bad odor from these panties because other people's reviews spoke about a fragrance. I didn't detect a bad odor and they were exactly what I ordered
"My five year old loves them, they fit well and she wants to wear them all the time."
I love these sandals.  I got the navy ones online because the store didn't have them.  I also have a brown pair.  They are so comfortable and give me the foot support I need.  A great addition to anyone's summer foot wear.
need more padding in bottom of shoe
What can I say the hubby love them!! To me there are so freaking heavy I don't know how he walks in them but he says they are so comfortable on the inside it's like walking on pillows and they fit great.  He's been wearing them for work he is a repo man and needs them in case a car should fall on his foot or anything else.  They are very nice looking.  They look just like they do in the picture and seem to be a little cheaper here then in the stores.  Especially if you're prime and get them delivered for free.
I ordered my husband the XXL and he is about 180 lbs . The sweater fits him just like I thought it would. It's very form fitting. My husband has a slim but muscular build so this sweater is very flattering to him. Love it!
"love the snake colors in these, they fit as expected"
"good
good."
"I love this swimsuit, follow the size chart listed in the drop bar and you will get the perfect fit. The suit has some stretch to it and the fabric feels nice. I wear an 8 in tops and 10 in bottoms and decided on the XL (8/10). The bra does not have push up, but does have good support. Summer 2016 here I come."
"Very pretty ,comfortable and it has a heel. That's all I need.!"
"I typically wear a 5.5, so that's what I ordered. They fit in the length, and width perfectly. The strap across the front was not too tight or too loose. The ankle strap was a little big around, but not enough that it caused me ant trouble walking. I could probably poke another hole in the strap to make it tighter for next time. I wore these at a wedding and found them more comfortable than expected.  They look like they are well made considering the price. I would buy them again in another color."
Fits my 10.5 feet. Good warm weather boot sock or shoe sock for price.
Perfect for my needs in a smaller crossbody bag. The leather is smooth and the color is perfect for spring and summer.
Super cute. Very good quality.  It even came in its own gift box.
"Beautiful skirt.  Material does feel cheap, but it looks lovely and hangs well."
"Looks like its from an expensive boutique!  Gorgeous, lightweight material, perfect for summer.  My little one wore it on vacation, perfect and flowy material, looks high end."
It's a great jacket. I got it on a sale with free shipping in my size. Saved almost 40$
Absolutely adorable. Purchased for 4 year old granddaughter. Her mother and she both love it!  Good quality and material is soft.
Fifth time I have purchased this bag. (I have one in every color available.) It is perfect for my needs.
"First thing, it does say that the waistband is an individual waistband, which means that the pattern is different than pictured. Actually, I like the waistband I received, it looks better than the one pictured. The pattern on the pants is as pictured and really they look great in person. I'm 5'3"" and the pants fit me perfectly, they are comfy and the waist band is stretchy so they will fit a lot of different sizes. The pocket does have the zipper closing and I think that is what sets these pants apart from others.  One thing they are scratchy out of the package but they do soften up after washing and there is no problem. Overall I'm very pleased with these pants and I hope they come out with more styles."
These shoes were perfect for cosplay and were so comfortable my kid wore them for regular use too.  Haven't had them long so can't speak to how long they hold up but so far they are great.
I wear a size 10.5-11 normal tennis shoe and this shoe runs slightly bigger than the 11 size that I got.
I love this brand of leggings. I'm a bit on the chunky side and they still for comfortably. all the leggings I've gotten from this company have had beautifully vivid color. They're so soft! My bf said they feel like skin
These are great earrings and very good in staying in.  They look neat.  I like them a lot.  They are a good quality.
"I don't know what I'm going to do with twelve of these, but I put two on my dogs' heads and use another one for my face while aboard the Iron Donkey. (That's my 49cc scooter...pretty badass I think you'll admit.)

Kind of stiff when you first open them, but they soften nicely in the wash. You'll be happy."
"Comfortable and light running shoe. Precision fit is perfect for my feet (somewhat narrow). The insoles are very flat. I have high arches and needed to replace the insoles with Sofsoles<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sof-Sole-Athlete-Full-Length-Comfort-Neutral-Arch-Replacement-Shoe-Insole-Insert/dp/B01IELL7IU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sof Sole Athlete Full Length Comfort Neutral Arch Replacement Shoe Insole/Insert</a>&nbsp;(as I do with almost all shoes).
I have only put on about 50 miles with these, but they are holding up well. Once they do wear out I will replace with the same model."
"Great, makes me feel pretty"
Love this hat!! It's well made and sturdy. I used it for a cruise and the chin strapped was a great plus!!
Love it t
"great quality, washed up nice, did not shrink, true to size!!!"
"It's a good brand,but it doesn't pull up and push your bust together as pictured. Still, good value and comfortable. I wish they made a 40 D. I had to buy a 38 and get a bra extender..."
"These were cute and we'll made, but fit smaller that her similarly constructed Adidas shoes of the same size.  We returned them for a full size larger to give her a half size to grow.  I'd say order AT LEAST a half size larger."
"I love this skirt much more than I thought I would. It came a little differently than I expected, but I guess that I didn't look at the picture close enough. The top of the skirt is a bit fitted. In other words, the pleats don't start a the waist. I may not be explaining it well, but either way, I ended up loving the skirt. The material was great, thick, and high quality. The skirt overall was very voluminous and beautiful. The colors were rich and this may now be my new favorite skirt!"
I love the height the shoes give me.  They are so comfortable.
Wish it was easier to close. Little hard to put the loop over the botton. Otherwise I really like it.
works great makes good helmet liner
"These are very comfortable, but they do also attract fish because of the bright rainbow stripe down the middle."
"I bought this for a trip to New York. I liked that I didn't have to push it over my head, but could put it on my head and then button it closed."
"Shipping was prompt, and the umbrella looks perfect for my upcoming trip!"
"Ordered two different Patterns:
1. Vintage Rust - Ordered a Small by mistake.  I'm 5'8.5, 167 pounds, usual size pants 10.  These actually fit!  A little lower in the waist than I'd like - was hoping for above the belly button but hit just below. The fabric is extremely stretchy and buttery soft, like Lularoe.  Other reviewers mentioned loose in the waist - these are, because the material is so stretchy.  So no dancing in these pants, but great for around town - LOVE the print.

2. Boho Mix Indigo - Size Medium. Woah, totally different fabric.  Stiffer, rougher, not so much stretch, tight in the legs.  Given the lack of stretch and how inexpensive these are, I imagine the seams would rip easily.  Hope to exchange for a Large, though I've heard returns can be tough.  Love the print.

Length on both pants about the same - just about 1/2-1 inch above the ground.  I usually wear a 33"" inseam."
I bought these for my twin girls and they said they love the way they fit! True to size and no shrinkage!
These shoes feel great and hold up well. They are really cute for a clog. This is my 3rd pair of Dansko clogs.
"Super cute, just like the picture. Nice soft, quality material. 5'6"" 180lb, and the medium is perfect. Arrived very fast! Going to order another color."
Perfect storage for those multiple ball caps and hangs behind the door.
These shoes exceeded my expectations. I was glad for customer feedback because while these sneakers were super comfy the advice to loosen the top laces was a game changer for the extreme soreness I felt in the tops of my feet .
"I like everything that marathon produces.  These spring bars are no exception.  Solid and dependable, I am trusting them with securing my best watches."
True to size. Very comfortable.
"As almost all  Anne Klein shoes  love them!  They are made of a great leather quality, nice style; they are very comfortables, I wear them all day long because I a a teacher, and I don't feel pain on my feet.  They look very nice."
"I couldn't be happier with my slippers.  They are soft, warm and very comfortable.  I especially love the fact that there is no ridge on the back of the slipper, so if they do slip a little I'm not stepping on a hard edge."
"Bought these as a wedding gift for bridesmaids. They seemed to like it. Looked good enough in pictures. I only wish they came in little boxes instead of plastic baggies, but oh well. Purchased some cheap jewelry boxes at the dollar store, problem solved."
even though we didn't keep these in our carry on it was still nice because TSA always goes through our stuff and we end up with open shampoo all over everything. yuck. and we were able to really stuff these. they also have a flat bottom which is nice!
"I love the way it fits. It covers as much of your head as seen in the picture, I am natural so when my press starts to wear out, I was able to cover all my new growth. I also love it with my braids because it keeps the hair from touching me when I need to."
"This is super cute, but why does it seem like all rain coats have very short sleeves? They are long enough but the sleeves are always too short for my kid... perhaps she just has extra long arms I don't know haha"
pretty for a gift
"They are beautiful, comfortable shoes. I have very high arches and baaaad feet, and these are comfy!!"
Fit really well. Washed and still fits perfectly
"I typically wear a size 10-12 or M to L in tops. I ordered this in a medium and it just fits. It's not too tight, but there is not much room to spare. Since I plan to wear it under a cami the fit is fine."
High quality product.  Too tight in the widest area of my foot.
"I ordered a size based on the other reviews.  I actually ordered a medium and large just to be safe.  The medium fits like a 6-8 in my opinion and the large fits like an 8-10 in my opinion.  For the price this is a GREAT swim suit!  It is a thick material and is very flattering on!  The navy is a true navy with cream lace and the black is a dark black (doesn't look faded) with white lace.  LOVE!!  I would buy this again!  Also, has great rear end coverage which I have a hard time with as I am larger on the bottom than the top.  You cannot even go to Target and get a swim suit this nice for the price!"
These were ordered for my 95 yr. old mom who walks 2 miles each & every day.  She loves them & they made a good gift for her.
He was absolutely handsome in this outfit!
"Love these shoes...and the name ""CLOUD STEPPERS""!...That is how they feel too. I own 3 pairs! Definitely would recommend."
Much more comfortable and durable. Highly recommend.
"I have a terrible time finding tennis shoes that fit my narrow foot. I even went to a New Balance store thinking they would have something, but nothing worked there either. I love these shoes. They are so comfortable and look great. Finally I can wear comfortable shoes when I have a lot of walking to do. overtime I visited my son in CA I could never keep up with all the sightseeing because I never had good fitting shoes. Can't wait for my next vacation!"
"Very pleased
Fit nicely"
These pants fit well around the waist but did need to be hemmed.  Just a bit too long.  Comfortable wearing and after first wash look nice out of the dryer.
"Love this ring!!! My original ring is an antique that I don't like to wear all the time so bought this as a spare.
Great fit, gorgeous sparkle and looks real"
My husband likes this shirt. It's soft and warm for our cold weather.
Very very pretty.
Everything fine.
Great fit and looksee very stylish
"They're snap caps; what can I say?  They fit my S&W perfectly, with no misfires."
"Cant wait to try them hiking! The straps tend to get a little snug around my toe when i tighten them, but I think they just need a little adjusting and getting used to. The arch support is amazing, though. So far I just use them to take walks and do things around the house. Taking them camping as soon as I get the chance!"
Absolutely love this sweater. It fits wonderfully and keeps you very warm in cold months.
nice  be careful will shrink a little
Time will tell about the durability of these shirts.  They arrived on time and are as described by the seller.  The price was definitely right.
Love these shoes.  Only ones I wear.
Really cute cover for passport.  Great that it has RFID protection.
Mildly  tight through the chest for 48 reg..50 reg would be too large. Cut and tailored more as a slim size.
"My wife loves it on her charm bracelet. The raised mistletoe are a very nice touch as well.

Simple & straight to the point :)"
"Lovely, lightweight scarf with vibrant colors. Was a little bulkier than I'd like but am happy with it"
"Very very beatiful shows with incredible fit, very light Wright and perfect for runnig. Would recomenda for everyone that wants a high Quality product with a great design."
"I got this for my husband to wear near constantly. After having it for a few months it finally broke, the rubber in the clap snapped, but my husband is hard on things. I bought two more because he liked them so much."
"These sweaters are true to size. My husband has become a US Polo Association fan due to the consistent quality, classic styling, and affordable price. The 1/4 zip is perfect for Friday night drinks with friends or weekends."
"Will never again travel without my packing cubes.  Highly recommend.  I just put my unders and bras in one to take to the bathroom in a hotel/guest room so I don't have to rummage thru a suitcase for my needs.  Put t-shirts in another, and rolled-up jeans/slacks in yet another.  Great travel invention."
Very nice product for the cost
"I have a 37"" waist and purchased a large which fits fine. Purchased for home wear only at my pool which is very private. I am too conservative to wear a speedo type suit in public. Wanted to maximize tan and not have a large suit that fills with air in pool and is slow to dry. I am pleased with this suit. Fits well, no drawstring which is not an issue. No bad or loose seams. Mine is black. It is not see through even when wet. I would prefer not to have the large label in front and it's not easily removed. No issues yet with sagging.
If you like me don't have a swimmers body with no fat then this type of suit will not enhance your appearance. Excellent value for the price and recommend."
"This is a well made, comfortable, and stylish shoe for an affordable price. I am quite happy with my purchase and would order these in another color."
"I bought the Large as suggested but it was a bit big around the arm pits. I'm 5'9, 150lbs, so mediums usually fit and in this case everything else in the dress was fine just around the arm pits are was a bit baggy, and I believe it's because I have a small bust (36B)."
"This is the Platonic Form of the watch cap.  Perfect fit, great warmth, durable wool.  Love this hat."
Daughter loved these boots as matter of fact so did older daughter and wife. Looks like I have to buy 2 more pair. Anyways youngest wants to be a greaser from the movie Cry Baby for Halloween.
I have been wearing Isotoner slippers for years.  They wear well and fit well.  They are comfortable and offer many options for color and style.
color is great will be able to wear this when my hair grows back.
Beautiful quality! Great to do business with!
Not the most durable for everyday wear but very comfortable
Loved it not that thick material really nice
"I understand they weren't meant for children, but its hard for me to get my son to wear belts at all. He complains they are either cold to his skin or that when they split, he gets scratched. The quality of cheap or dual leather ones that are far more expensive burns me up."
Love it!  Lots of space for everything I need.
Where have these sandals been all my life!  Like walking on a cloud!!  Love them!  Will buy more!
"I bought these earrings for a Christmas gift and they are very pretty. I like the size of them, not too small and not too big, just right. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is the colour just has a hint of blue in them; they are more like aquamarine in colour."
"Very comfortable.  Not a great shaper for a C cup, however.  A bit of an unaboob!"
